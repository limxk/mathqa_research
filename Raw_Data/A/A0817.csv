"2376224","2376239","<p>Basically $S$ is a set of commuting operators and $\vert s\rangle$ is a common eigenvector of elements of this set.  </p>

<p>To generate the two vectors you have, one might as well assume that elements of the set are diagonal, so pick them to be
$$
s_1=\hat 1\, , \qquad s_2=\sigma_z

with $\sigma_z$ the Pauli matrix.  The common eigenvectors are $[1,0]^T$ and $[0,1]^T$.</p>

$$
U=\left(\begin{array}{cc}

$$
and note that $U[1,0]^T=(\alpha,\beta)$ and $U$ is unitary.  Thus to get the set that will have $\psi$ as eigenvectors you need to conjugate $\hat 1$ and $\sigma_z$ by $U$, i.e. your new set is $\{\hat 1,U\sigma_zU^{-1}\}$.  </p>

<p>If you need elements in $S$ to be unitary you can just use $e^{-i\alpha \sigma_z}$ instead of $\sigma_z$.  The key point is that the eigenvalues of your second operator should be distinct.</p>

"
"2376257","2376273","<p>This is a partial answer.  We'll reduce the question to one of representation theory (of Lie groups), and give an answer in two ""extreme"" cases.</p>

<p>Suppose $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection of some Riemannian metric $g_1$.  Since $\nabla$ is torsion-free, we know that $\nabla$ will be the Levi-Civita connection of a metric $g_2$ if and only if $\nabla g_2 = 0$.  This means that we have to understand which (positive-definite) symmetric $2$-tensor fields are $\nabla$-parallel.  Understanding which tensor fields are $\nabla$-parallel can be accomplished via:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Holonomy Principle:</strong> Let $\nabla$ be a connection on a connected smooth manifold $M$.  Let $\text{Hol}_x \leq \text{GL}(T_xM)$ denote the holonomy group (really, holonomy representation) of $\nabla$ at $x \in M$.</p>
  
  <p>(a) If $T \in \Gamma(TM^{\otimes r} \otimes T^*M^{\otimes s})$ is a parallel tensor field on $M$, then $T|_x$ is fixed by the $\text{Hol}_x$-action on $T_xM^{\otimes r} \otimes T_x^*M^{\otimes s}$.</p>
  
  <p>(b) Conversely: If $T_0$ is a tensor at $x$ fixed by the $\text{Hol}_x$-action on $T_xM^{\otimes r} \otimes T_x^*M^{\otimes s}$, then there exists a unique parallel tensor field $T$ on $M$ with $T|_x = T_0$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since our connection $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection of some (let's say Riemannian) metric $g_1$, we have $\text{Hol}_x \leq \text{SO}(T_xM, g_1) \cong \text{SO}(n)$.  The question is now: What is the space of (positive-definite) symmetric $2$-tensors at $x$ which are fixed by the $\text{Hol}_x$-action on $\text{Sym}^2(T^*_xM) \subset T_x^*M^{\otimes 2}$.  This is a question of representation theory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> (The trivial example) Suppose $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection of a flat metric $g_1$, and suppose $M$ is connected and simply-connected.  Then $\text{Hol}_x = 0$ is the identity group, so every element of $\text{Sym}^2(T_x^*M)$ is fixed.</p>
  
  <p>Concretely: If $g_0$ is any (positive-definite) symmetric $2$-tensor at $x$, then (by the Holonomy Principle) we can extend $g_0$ uniquely to a $\nabla$-parallel tensor field $g$ on all of $M$.  The upshot is that, for the sort of connections $\nabla$ in this example, we essentially have an $\binom{n+1}{2}$-dimensional space of compatible metrics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that the dimension $\binom{n+1}{2}$ is the largest possible.  For the Levi-Civita connection of a ""generic"" Riemannian metric $g_1$, the holonomy group will be all of $\text{SO}(n)$, and the space of compatible metrics will be $1$-dimensional.</p>

<p>I do not know about the intermediate cases -- i.e., when $\nabla$ is not generic and not flat.  (My representation theory needs some work!)</p>
"
"2376260","2376329","<p>We can see that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n^2}$ is not convergent for $x &gt; 1$, which is clear considering that $\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{x^n}{n^2} = \infty$ for $x &gt; 1$ (if this is not obvious, use l'Hôspital's rule twice). Therefore, we consider only $x\in (0, 1]$. Notice that $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^{n-1}}{n} = \frac{1}{x}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n} = -\frac{\log(1-x)}{x}$$ for $x\in (0, 1)$. Convergence is readily apparent by the ratio test, and then we have uniform convergence on compact sets by Dini's theorem (or by the Weierstrass M-test, but Dini's theorem is easy here). For $x = 1$, we get the harmonic series, which diverges. Note that $g(x) = -\frac{\log(1-x)}{x}$ is $C^{\infty}$-smooth on $(0, 1)$.</p>

"2376263","2376268","<p>The key step is as follows: \begin{align*} \lvert x_m-x_n\rvert &amp;= \left\lvert \sum_{k=0}^{m-n-1} x_{m-k}-x_{m-k-1}\right\rvert \\ &amp;\leq \sum_{k=0}^{m-n-1} \lvert x_{m-k}-x_{m-k-1}\rvert \end{align*}</p>

"2376279","2376320","<p>Correct! Those 3 axioms plus modus ponens form a <em>complete</em> proof system: every valid argument involving $\neg$ and $\rightarrow$ can be proven to be valid using just those 3 axioms plus modus ponens.  And since $\{ \neg, \rightarrow \}$ is an expressively complete set of operators, any propositional logic operator can be defined in terms of them, and hence any argument as well and again: if it is valid, it can be proven to be valid within this very simple system (the proofs themselves, of course, are often far from simple!  Though there <em>are</em> algorithms to automatically create a proof for any valid argument)</p>

<p>You also asked about transforming axioms into inference rules. I am not exactly sure what you mean, but obviously each axiom can be treated as an inference rule: from nothing, you can infer a statement of the form as indicated. </p>

<p>Oh, and please note: the letters $p$, $q$, and $r$ are sentence <em>variables</em>, meaning that you can fill in <em>any</em> sentence for them. Thus, for example:</p>

"2376391","2376487","<p>We prove that any odd prime works if the product is allowed to be prime up to a sign, but that the product being positive (as prime numbers are) ensures the achievable prime values are those of the form $4k+1$ as you conjectured.</p>

<p>Setting three factors to $\pm 1$ and the fourth to $\pm p$ with $p\in\mathbb{P}$ is equivalent to solving $M\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{y}$, where the vector $\mathbf{y}$ can take one of $16$ values (we can place $p$ in one of four positions and apply one of two signs freely to two entries so the other sign is then determined by the requirement that the entries' product is positive so as to be prime; we don't consider cases where an entry is $-p$, since if this works we can multiple the whole vector by $-1$). The matrix $M$ satisfies $M^{-1}=\frac{1}{4}M$, so $\mathbb{x}=\frac{1}{4}M\mathbb{y}$. We thus get a solution iff each entry of $M\mathbb{y}$ is a multiple of $4$.</p>

<p>The first such constraint is $4|y_1+y_2+y_3+p$ if without loss of generality $y_4\ne 1$, but since each $y_1=\pm 1$ we can set $\sum_{i=1}^3 y_i$ to any odd integer from $-3$ to $+3$, so any odd $p$ can be made to work for a suitable choice of $\mathbb{y}$ (whereas $p=2$ cannot). Relative to this constraint, each other constraint subtracts twice the sum of some two $y_i$, requiring only that each such pair have the same parity, which certainly works for any odd $p$.</p>

<p>Thus the only remaining difficulty in achieving a given odd prime value for the product is ensuring we don't get $-p$ instead. For $y_1=y_2=y_3=1,\,y_4=p\in\mathbb{P}\backslash\{ 2\}$ each of the constraints checks either $p+3$ or $1-p$ or $p-1$ for divisibility by $4$, so that's the $p=4k+1$ case ticked off. With $p=4k-1$ we can't make it work, since the first constraint requires either $4|p+3$ or $4|p-1$.</p>

$G(z,x) =  (\sqrt{1-x^2}\,z,x)\in S^2$. In this way you obtain a map $H = GF : [0,1] \times [-1,1]\to S^2$ with the property that</p>

"2376418","2384142","<p>You are interested in finding a $K$ such that </p>

<p>$$
A - B\,K = V\,\Lambda\,V^{-1}, \tag{1}
$$</p>

<p>with $A,\Lambda,V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$, $K \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and $\Lambda$ a diagonal matrix (the right hand side is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix#Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">eigendecomposition</a> of the desired closedloop matrix). I will assume that the pair $(A,B)$ is controllable so $\Lambda$ can be chosen freely, furthermore the rank of $B$ is assumed to be equal to $m$. If this last assumption is not the case then it won't change the possible $V$ that could be chosen when using a new $B$ matrix instead, which has the same span as the original $B$ but does satisfy this condition.</p>

<p>When looking at the constrains and degrees of freedom it is possible to get an idea of how many columns of $V$ (the eigenvectors) can be chosen freely. Namely the number of degrees of freedom are equal to $n$ times $m$. Choosing the eigenvalues ($\Lambda$) adds $n$ constraints. Choosing a column of $V$ adds $n-1$ constraints, namely the length of the eigenvector does not matter (as long as it is none zero). So from this it can be concluded that the largest number of eigenvectors $p$ that can be chosen freely should equal</p>

<p>$$
p \leq \frac{n (m - 1)}{n - 1}. \tag{2}
$$</p>

<p>When $m = n$ it is trivial to show that all nonsingular $V$ are allowed. The matrix $K$ can then be found using</p>

<p>$$
K = B^{-1} (A - V\,\Lambda\,V^{-1}). \tag{3}
$$</p>

<p>For $m &gt; n$ then $B$ can be reduced to a $m=n$, however it is also possible to use the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_element#Matrices"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">right inverse</a>, which will minimize the 2-norm of $u$.</p>

<p>Now comes the more difficult and interesting case, namely when $m &lt; n$ and thus not all columns of $V$ can be chosen freely. However it can be noted that if $m = 1$ then all degrees of freedom of $K$ need to be used to satisfy the constraints for $\Lambda$, so then for a given $\Lambda$ the matrix $V$ will be fixed. By multiplying equation $(1)$ on the right hand side by $V$ and define a new temporary matrix $\Omega = K\,V$ then the following linear matrix equation can be obtained</p>

<p>$$
A\,V - B\,\Omega = V\,\Lambda. \tag{4}
$$</p>

<p>Equation $(4)$ can be reduced to a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations#Matrix_equation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">linear system of equations</a>. In order to do this equation $(4)$ has to be reshaped from a matrix of $n \times n$ into a vector of $n^2 \times 1$. One way of achieving this would be</p>

<p>$$
\begin{bmatrix}
A\,V_{\bullet,1} - B\,\Omega_{\bullet,1} - \Lambda_{1,1} V_{\bullet,1} \\
A\,V_{\bullet,2} - B\,\Omega_{\bullet,2} - \Lambda_{2,2} V_{\bullet,2} \\
\vdots \\
A\,V_{\bullet,n} - B\,\Omega_{\bullet,n} - \Lambda_{n,n} V_{\bullet,n}
\end{bmatrix} = 0, \tag{5}
$$</p>

<p>where $X_{\bullet,i}$ denotes the $i$th column of matrix $X$. Next all constraints have to be defined. In order to constrain the length of the of the columns of $V$ which are not chosen freely one can set for example the first element of each of these columns to one. However it can be possible that later this will yield a singular systems of equations, if so you might have to try to set a different element of a column to one. For now I do not have a better solution than trial and error, however I suspect that this should not happen that often. The $p$ chosen columns of $V$ and the elements equal to one of the remaining columns can be substituted into equation $(5)$. This can then be rewritten as linear system of equations, since all unknown parameters only occur linearly. It can be noted that since $V_{\bullet,i}$ and $\Omega_{\bullet,i}$ only occur in the $i$th set of $n$ rows from equation $(5)$, therefore it can also be rewritten as $n$ linear systems of equations.</p>

<p>This formulated system of linear equations however will always be singular when an entire column of $V$ is specified by the user. This is because the only remaining unknown parameters related to that column of $V$ will be pre-multiplied by the $B$ matrix. So in order to be able to solve for the unknown parameters $\Omega_{\bullet,i}$ then $(A-\Lambda_{i,i} I)V_{\bullet,i}$ would have to lie within the span of $B$. Or if $\Lambda_{i,i}$ is not an eigenvalue of $A$, then $V_{\bullet,i}$ would have to lie within the span of $(A-\Lambda_{i,i} I)^{-1} B$. Therefore $\Lambda_{i,i}$ and $V_{\bullet,i}$ can never be chosen entirely freely.</p>

<p>As stated in the previous paragraph the allowed choices for columns of $V$ are limited to a $m$ dimensional span. Choosing a vector from this span will only add $m-1$ constraints per chosen column of $V$ instead of $n-1$, so equation $(2)$ will become $p=n$. This would imply that all columns of $V$ can then be chosen, as long as they lie within a certain span. According to equation $(1)$ $V$ has to be none singular, so all columns of $V$ have to be linearly independent of each other. This implies that the eigenvalues of $\Lambda$ can have at most an multiplicity of $m$, since it is impossible to choose more then $m$ independent columns from a span of dimension $m$. If a higher multiplicity is desired then the structure of $\Lambda$ would have to be changed to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_normal_form"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jordan form</a>, but the number of associated Jordan blocks to the same eigenvalue should still be at most be $m$. The constraint on the multiplicity of the eigenvalues of $\Lambda$ also holds for the place() command in MATLAB, so I suspect that it uses a similar method of solving this problem (at least based on eigenvalue decomposition instead of the more general Jordan decomposition).</p>

<p>Once all desired constraints are applied then each $n$ dimensional linear system of equations can be solved. If $V_{\bullet,i}$ is only constrained in its length, then there will be more unknowns then equations and again the right inverse could be used to solve for $\Omega_{\bullet,i}$ and the rest of $V_{\bullet,i}$. Once all linear systems of equations are solved, then all solution can be rewritten to form $V$ and $\Omega$. The controller gain can be obtained through $K = \Omega\,V^{-1}$.</p>

<p>And something like logical equivalence between formulas is actually a really important notion, as it allows us to claim that, for example, that the sentences $\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))$ and $\forall x (\neg Q(x) \rightarrow \neg P(x))$ are logically equivalent by pointing out that their bodies are logically equivalent <em>formulas</em> and using the 'Substitution of logically equivalent formulas Principle' that claims that substituting logically equivalent formulas in larger formulas results in logically equivalent formulas formulas (this Principle is itself a generalization of the Substitution of logically equivalent sentences Principle of course).</p>

<p>Thus, there is some real use to being  able to generalise important logical concepts to formulas, rather than just  sentences. And so it would make sense to have a proof system that is able to prove those logical  properties and relationships for formulas in general.</p>

"2376442","2376486","<p>First we compute the inner integral
$$\int_{\partial D}{1\over |x-y|}\&gt;dx$$
when $y:=(0,0,1)$ is the north pole. Here $dx$ denotes the surface element on the sphere. Introduce spherical coordinates with $\theta=0$ at $(0,0,1)$. Then
$$\int_{\partial D}{1\over |x-y|}\&gt;dx=\int_0^\pi{1\over2\sin{\theta\over2}}\&gt;2\pi\sin\theta\&gt;d\theta=2\pi\int_0^\pi\cos{\theta\over2}\&gt;d\theta=4\pi\ .$$
Due to rotational symmetry the inner integral is in fact independent of $y$. We therefore obtain
$$\int_{\partial D}\int_{\partial D}{1\over |x-y|}\&gt;dx\&gt;dy=4\pi\cdot 4\pi\ .$$</p>

for positives $a$, $b$ and $c$. 
$$\sum_{cyc}\frac{b^2c}{a^2(\sqrt{3(a^2+b^2+c^2)}c+ab)}\geq\frac{3}{4}\sqrt{\frac{3}{a^2+b^2+c^2}}$$ or

Now, by AM-GM and C-S we obtain
$$\sum_{cyc}\frac{6b^2c}{a^2(2\sqrt{3(a^2+b^2+c^2)}3c+6ab)}\geq\sum_{cyc}\frac{6b^2c}{a^2(3(a^2+b^2+c^2)+9c^2+6ab)}=$$

$$8(a^2b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)^2\sqrt{\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{3}}\geq3 a^2b^2c^2\sum\limits_{cyc}(4a^3+a^2b+a^2c+2abc).$$
Let $a+b+c=3u$, $ab+ac+bc=3v^2$ and $abc=w^3$.</p>

<p>Hence, we need to prove that
$$9(9v^4-6uw^3)^2\sqrt{3u^2-2v^2}\geq3w^6(4(27u^3-27uv^2+3w^3)+9uv^2-3w^3+6w^3$$ or $f(w^3)\geq0$, where
$$f(w^3)=3(3v^4-2uw^3)^2\sqrt{3u^2-2v^2}-(36u^3-33uv^2+5w^3)w^6,$$
which is decreasing function, which says that it's enough to prove the last inequality </p>

<p>for a maximal value of $w^3$, which happens for equality case of two variables.</p>

<p>Since the last inequality is homogeneous, we can assume $b=c=1$, which gives
$$8(2a^2+1)^2\sqrt{\frac{a^2+2}{3}}\geq3a^2(4(a^3+2)+2(a^2+a+1)+6a)$$
or $g(a)\geq0$, where
$$g(a)=2\ln(2a^2+1)+\frac{1}{2}\ln(a^2+2)-2\ln{a}-\ln(2a^3+a^2+4a+5)+2\ln2-\frac{3}{2}\ln3.$$
But
$$g'(a)=\frac{(a-1)(2a^5+2a^4+29a^3+17a^2+44a+20)}{a(a^2+2)(2a^2+1)(2a^3+a^2+4a+5)},$$

Once you have the reduced row echelon form you can directly read that

<p>So the bottom line is that, near the peak, it can be well approximated by a continuous function; far away from the peak, the distribution is actually dropping a factor of 2 or 10 or 100 from one point to the next, so integrating a continuous function in that region is pretty inaccurate. But since your $f(n)$ is mostly useful as a probability distribution, nearly all of the distribution is near the peak (which actually gets very very narrow for large $N$), so in all of the region that actually contributes to any expectation values or medians, it is well-approximated by a continuous function.</p>

<p>$\Delta y$ does indeed tend to $0$. However, this isn't assumed, since if $\Delta x \to 0$, $\Delta y \to 0$ as well, since continuity is weaker than differentiability. Or, algebraically, if you consider </p>

"2376618","2376680","<p>Please keep in mind that what follows is basically an expansion of the remark provided by Peyton.</p>

<p>Suppose that $f|_{B(0,r)}$ is not injective. Then, for some $a\in\mathbb C$, the equation $f(z)=a$ has two distinct solutions in $B(0,r)$. Now, let $\gamma\colon[0,2\pi]\longrightarrow\mathbb C$ be the loop defined by $\gamma(t)=r'e^{it}$, for some $r'\in(r,1)$ chosen such that the equation $f(z)=a$ has no roots with absolute value equal to $r'$. Then, by the argument principle and since $f$ has no poles, $\frac1{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)-a}\mathrm dz$ is a natural number greater than $1$. On the other hand, if $\Gamma=f\circ\gamma$, then$$\frac1{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)-a}\mathrm dz=\frac1{2\pi i}\int_\Gamma\frac{\mathrm dz}{z-a}=\operatorname{Ind}_\Gamma(a).$$So, the winding number of $\Gamma$ with respect to $a$ is greater than $2$. So, $\Gamma$ loops around $a$ twice (at least). But then it must intersect itself, and therefore the restriction of $f$ to the image of $\gamma$ cannot be injective.</p>

"2376628","2376674","<p>I think you're totally on right track. First, let's solve the special case where your open cover $\{V_i \}$ consists only of two sets, $V_1$ and $V_2$.</p>

<p>In this special case, there exists a $t_1 \in \mathcal F(V_1)$ and a $t_2 \in \mathcal F(V_2)$ such that $$\varphi(t_1) = s|_{V_1}, \ \ \ \ \ \ \varphi(t_2) = s|_{V_2},$$
and your difficulty is that $t_1$ and $t_2$ do not glue together.</p>

<p>However, you showed that there exists a $a_{12} \in \mathcal F'(V_1 \cap V_2)$ such that $$\psi(a_{12}) = t_1 - t_2$$
and using the fact that $\mathcal F'$ is flasque, you also argued that there exists a $b_2 \in \mathcal F'(V_2)$ such that
$$ b_2 |_{V_1 \cap V_2} = a_{12}.$$
So let's define $$\widetilde t_1=t_1 \in \mathcal F(V_1), \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \widetilde t_2 = t_2 + \psi(b_2)\in \mathcal F(V_2),$$</p>

<p>What's nice about $\widetilde t_1$ and $\widetilde t_2$ is that: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Just like the original sections $t_1$ and $t_2$, they map onto $s|_{V_1}$ and $s|_{V_2}$ under $\varphi$:
$$ \varphi(\widetilde t_1) = s|_{V_1}, \ \ \ \ \ \varphi(\widetilde t_2) = s|_{V_2} + \varphi \circ \psi(b_2) = s|_{V_2} + 0 = s|_{V_2}.$$</p></li>
<li><p>And moreover, $\widetilde t_1$ and $\widetilde t_2$ agree on $V_1 \cap V_2$:
$$ \widetilde t_2|_{V_1 \cap V_2} =  t_2|_{V_1 \cap V_2} + \psi(a_{12}) = t_2|_{V_1 \cap V_2} + (t_1 - t_2)|_{V_1 \cap V_2} = t_1|_{V_1 \cap V_2}. $$
So $\widetilde t_1$ and $\widetilde t_2$ glue together to form a section $\widetilde t \in \mathcal F(U)$ that maps onto $s$ under $\varphi$.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Now let's discuss the general case. We're going to deduce this from the special case, using Zorn's lemma.</p>

<p>Consider the set of tuples $(V, t)$ where $t \in \mathcal F(V)$ and $\varphi(t) = s|_V$, and define an ordering on this set of tuples by declaring that $(V, t) \leq (V', t')$ iff $V \subseteq V'$ and $t'|_{V} = t$. It is not hard to see that every chain $\{ (V_\alpha, t_\alpha) \}$ in our set of tuples has an upper bound: to construct this upper bound, we take $V = \bigcup_\alpha V_\alpha$, and we use the sheaf axioms to glue the $t_\alpha$ together to form a section $t \in \mathcal F(V)$. So we may apply Zorn's lemma to conclude that our set of tuples has a maximal element, $(V_{\rm max}, t_{\rm max})$.</p>

<p>The only thing left to check is that $V_{\rm max} = U$. Suppose that $x$ is a point in $U \ \backslash \ V_{\rm max}$. Then there exists an open neighbourhood $V_{\rm extra}$ of $x$, and a section $t_{\rm extra} \in \mathcal F(V_{\rm extra})$ such that $\varphi(t_{\rm extra}) = s|_{V_{\rm extra}}$. Using our proof of the special case of the theorem from earlier, with $V_{\rm max}$ and $V_{\rm extra}$ in place of $V_1$ and $V_2$, we deduce that there exists a section $t \in \mathcal F(V_{\rm max} \cup V_{\rm extra})$ extending $t_{\rm max}$ such that $\varphi(t) = s|_{V_{\rm max} \cup V_{\rm extra}}$. By maximality, it must be the case that $V_{\rm max} = V_{\rm max} \cup V_{\rm extra}$, contradicting our assumption that $x \notin V_{\rm max}$.</p>

<p>(Note that $t$ does not extend $t_{\rm extra}$, because we have to modify $t_{\rm extra}$ by adding on $\psi(b_{\rm  extra})$ so that it glues with $t_{\rm max}$ on $V_{\rm max} \cap V_{\rm extra}$. But this doesn't matter!)</p>

$$A\begin{bmatrix} 0.6 &amp; 0.2 &amp; 0.2 \\ 0.5 &amp; 0.3 &amp; 0.1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.6 &amp; 0.5\\ 0.2 &amp; 0.3 \\ 0.2&amp; 0.1 \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} 0.9 &amp; 0.05 &amp; 0.05 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 0.6 &amp; 0.5\\ 0.2 &amp; 0.3 \\ 0.2&amp; 0.1 \end{bmatrix}.$$ </p>

<p>That is</p>

<p>$$A\begin{bmatrix}0.44 &amp; 0.38 \\ 0.38&amp;0.35\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 0.56&amp;0.47\\0.6&amp;0.5\end{bmatrix}.$$ Thus, if $A$ exists, it must be </p>

If we fix $i$ we can take the usual homology on the complex $K^i_*$ with $H^i_k=Z^i_k/B^i_k$ where we have $$Z^i_k \approx ker \, \partial^i_k \,\, \text{and} \,\, B^i_k \approx Im \, \partial^i_{k+1}$$
Intuitively this is, $Z^i_k \subset K^i_k$ are the cycles in $K^i_k$ and $B^i_k \subset K^i_k$ are the elements of $K^i_k$ which are the boundaries of some $\gamma \in K^i_{k+1}$. Thus $H^i_k$ are the elements of $K^i_k$ which are cycles but not boundaries of elements in $K^i_{k+1}$.</p>

<p>Similarly for $H^{i,p}_k \approx Z^i_k / (B^{i+p}_k \cap Z^i_k)$ $Z^i_k$ are cycles in $K^i_k$ and $B^{i+p}_k$ are the boundaries of elements $\gamma \in K^{i+p}_{k+1}$ and consequently boundaries of $\sigma \in K^i_{k+1}$. So elements of $H^{i+p}_k$ are cycles i $K^i_k$ which are not the boundaries for any element $\gamma \in K^j_{k+1}; \forall j \leq i+p$. In this way $H^{i,p}_k$ is a further restriction on $H^i_k$.</p>

<p>Regarding your second question. As stated in the paper the above filtered complex is a persistent complex. To obtain the desired persistent module for fixed $i$ we compute $H^i_k$ (not the persistent homology) for all $k$ then take the sum $\bigoplus_{k=0}^\infty H^i_k$ and with the inclusion maps $\eta^{i}: \bigoplus_{k=0}^\infty H^i_k \rightarrow \bigoplus_{k=0}^\infty H^{i+1}_k$ we have the desired persistence module. As to how this module is connected to the persistent homology group, see the section of the source <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.116.2471&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""3.3 Interpretation"">3.3 Interpretation</a> in which the authors ask ""when $e+B^l_k$ is a basis element for the persistent groups $H^{l,p}_k$.""</p>

"2376765","2377114","<p>Since the curl of a gradient is zero, $\vec{B}$ has to satisfy $\nabla \times \vec{B} = 0$ for this equation to make sense (take the curl of both sides to see this). This condition is actually the key to finding the inverse.</p>

<p>Suppose we have a simply-connected open region $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ where $\nabla a = \vec{B}$. Define
$$ A(\gamma) = \int_{\gamma} \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{x}, $$
where $\gamma:[0,1] \to \Omega$ is a smooth curve joining the fixed point $\vec{x}_0 \in \Omega$ to $\vec{x}$. Now, we can show that $A$ in fact only depends on the endpoint: if $\gamma'$ is another smooth curve joining $\vec{x}_0$ to $\vec{x}$,
$$A(\gamma)-A(\gamma') = \int_{\Gamma} \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{x}, $$
where $\Gamma$ is a piecewise-smooth closed curve, which we assume does not intersect itself. Since $\Omega$ is simply-connected, $\Gamma$ bounds a two-dimensional surface, and so Stokes's Theorem implies that the right-hand side is zero because the curl of $\vec{B}$ is zero. Hence $A=A(\vec{x})$.</p>

<p>One can also show that $\nabla A = \vec{B}$:
$$ A(\vec{x}+\vec{h})-A(\vec{x})-\vec{h} \cdot \vec{B}(\vec{x}) = \int_{\vec{x}}^{\vec{x}+\vec{h}} (\vec{B}(\vec{x}')-\vec{B}(\vec{x})) \cdot d\vec{x}', $$
and since $\vec{B}$ is continuous (or it wouldn't be differentiable), the integral is $o(\lVert h \rVert)$, so $\nabla A =\vec{B}$.</p>

"2376778","2382581","<p>I spoke to my supervisor who helped me find an answer to this question, so I will share for any future readers who have the same question.</p>

<p>Assume for the sake of contradiction that there are two minimal generating sets for the cone: $x_1,...,x_n$ and $v_1,...,v_m$, and that $x_1$ does not lie in the same line as any $v_j$.</p>

<p>Since each $x_i$ is in the cone, it can be generated by $v_1,...,v_n$. Therefore we can write $x_i=\sum a_{ij}vj$ for some $a_{ij}\in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$. Similarly each $v_j$ can be written as $\sum b_{ij} x_i$ for some $b_{ij}\in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$.</p>

<p>Combining these we get $x_i=\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij}b_{ij}x_i$.</p>

<p>Therefore, renaming our constants and collecting like terms,  there exists $c_i\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $c_1x_1=\sum_{i=2}^n c_ix_i$. Here $c_1=1-a_{11}b_{11}\in \mathbb{R}$ and $c_i=a_{1i}b_{1i}\in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$. We can assume that $c_2,...,c_n$ are not all zero as this would only be possible if $x_1$ was in the same line as some $v_j$.</p>

<p>There are three cases: $c_i&gt;0$, $c_i=0$ and $c_i&lt;0$.</p>

<p>If $c_i&gt;0$, then $x_1=\sum_{i=2}^n\frac{c_i}{c_1}x_i$. Since $\frac{c_i}{c_1}\in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, this implies $x_1\in \text{Cone}(x_2,...,x_n)$ which contradicts the fact that $x_1,...,x_n$ is a minimal generating set.</p>

<p>If $c_i=0$, then $0=\sum_{i=2}^nc_ix_i$. Not all of the $c_i$ are zero, so without loss of generality we can assume $c_2\ne 0$. Then $-c_2=\sum_{i=3}^n\frac{c_i}{c_2}x_i\in \text{Cone}(x_1,...,x_n)$, which contradicts the strong convexity of the cone.</p>

<p>Finally if $c_i&lt;0$ then $x_1=\sum_{i=2}^n\frac{c_i}{c_1}x_i$, which again contradicts the strong convexity of the cone.</p>

<p>Therefore, up to scalar multiples, $v_1,...,v_n$ is the only minimal generating set.</p>

<p>We have shown that given an $x$, the nearest ""greedy"" sum of squares is at most $2^{3/2} x^{1/4}$ away. So we've shown that there is a sum of squares in intervals of the shape $(x - 2^{3/2} x^{1/4}, x]$, which clearly implies the original question.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Notes</strong></p>

<p>In comments, Will Jagy noted that the density of numbers which are sums of two squares is of the shape $Cx/\sqrt{\log x}$, where $C$ is the Landau-Ramanujan constant. It is conjectured that the gaps between numbers which are sums of squares shouldn't deviate too far from what is expected from the density, and in particular is bounded by $x^\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. In particular it is conjectured that there is a number which is a sum of two squares in the interval $[x, x + x^{\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, for $x$ sufficiently large.</p>

<p>This answer shows that the gap between numbers which are sums of squares is at most $2^{3/2}x^{1/4}$, which is a far cry from $x^{\epsilon}$.</p>

<p>In general, there are not good uniform improvements over what's presented above. But there are remarkable on-average bounds due to Hooley, showing for instance that almost all (in the density sense) gaps between sums of squares is no more than $(\log x) (\log \log x)$.</p>

  <p>But this doesn't seem to lead anywhere useful.</p>

<p>Actually, it does. You asked us to show you how to set up the problem, rather than to give a full answer, and that's commendable; but you <em>have</em> set it up correctly, so I think the right thing for me to do here is to indicate to you how to <em>finish</em> it.</p>

<p>The point is that there are lots of ways to find bijections between the sets $\{$infinite sequences of positive integers$\}$ and some subset of $\mathbb{R}$. The first step to doing this is to recognize that this is just a fancy way of saying ""find an injection from $\{$infinite sequences of positive integers$\}$ to $\mathbb{R}$"" (since this is then a bijection from $\{$infinite sequences of positive integers$\}$ to the <em>range</em> of that injection).</p>

<p>So to recap: <strong>Cantor-Shroeder-Bernstein</strong> tells us that all we need to do is find injections both ways. You already know an injection in one direction, so the entire remaining task is: <em>find an injection from $\{$infinite sequences of positive integers$\}$ to $\mathbb{R}$.</em> You (commendably!) don't want spoilers, so I've put one possible way to do this at the end of my answer.</p>

<hr>

<p>Incidentally, although it's often used to mean ""by contradiction,"" I interpret ""indirectly"" here as meaning the weaker ""not constructing an explicit bijection"" - and this in turn is usually, in this context, meant to suggest using Cantor-Shroeder-Bernstein. So I would rephrase the argument as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We have an injection from reals to sequences of positive integers (e.g., via not-eventually-all-$1$s binary expansions - but change $0$ to $1$ and $1$ to $2$ so that we actually get a sequence of <em>positive</em> integers).</p></li>
<li><p>We have an injection from sequences of positive integers to reals (e.g., the one above).</p></li>
<li><p>So by CSB we know that the two sets have the same cardinality.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that CSB <a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/questions/123482/is-there-a-constructive-proof-of-cantor-bernstein-schroeder-theorem"">is fundamentally not constructive</a>, although it doesn't use the axiom of choice. So by invoking CSB, the argument above does avoid building an explicit bijection. That said, it is easy to tweak the argument to <em>produce</em> an explicit bijection.</p>

<hr>

<p>Alright, let's wrap up. I wrote above that all that's left to do is to <em>find an injection from $\{$infinite sequences of positive integers$\}$ to $\mathbb{R}$.</em> One way to do this is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For an infinite sequence $f$ of positive integers, let $Real(f)$ be the number whose binary expansion consists of $f(1)$-many $1$s, then a $0$, then $f(2)$-many $1$s, then a $0$, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As an example, $Real(1, 2,3, 4, 5, 6, ...)$ is just $$0.101101110111101111101111110...$$</p>

<p>It's easy to show that the map $Real$ is injective, so is a bijection between $\{$infinite sequences of positive integers$\}$ and $ran(Real)$ - and the latter is a set of real numbers, so we're done.</p>

<p>There are lots of similar tricks one can do (e.g. using continued fractions is much more natural, but I like the ""algorithmic"" feel of the construction above; also, it is easier to verify).</p>

"2377048","2377063","<p>The subdifferential of $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ at some $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the set of all vectors $g \in \mathbb{R}^n$ (called subgradients) such that
$$f(x_0) + \langle g,x - x_0 \rangle \le f(x), \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n.$$</p>

<p>If $f$ were differentiable and convex, then the above would hold for $g=\nabla f(x_0)$, since the left-hand side would be the linear approximation of $f$ near $x_0$, which would lie below the function $f$.
If you want to visualize this, in dimension $n=1$ this is saying that the tangent line of a convex function at some $x_0$ lies below the graph of the function. If $n=2$, then the left-hand side is the tangent plane that approximates $f$ at $x_0$, and lies below the graph of $f$.</p>

<p>When $f$ is not differentiable, there may be more than one such $g$ that works. For instance, consider $f(x)=|x|$, which is the $l^1$ norm in one dimension. Then the left-hand side is a line with slope $g \in \mathbb{R}$.</p>

<ul>
<li>If $x_0&gt;0$, the only such $g$ that satisfies the definition is $g=1$, which is the sign of $x$.</li>
<li>Similarly if $x_0&lt;0$, the only such $g$ that satisfies the definition is $g=-1$, which is the sign of $x$.</li>
<li>However, if $x_0=0$, then any $g \in [-1,1]$ will work.</li>
</ul>

<p>[To visualize the above bullet points, just try to draw a line that touches $f$ at $x_0$, but lies entirely below $f$. The valid slopes you can use are the elements of the subgradient.]</p>

Notice that they both determine the same subgroup $\{0,3,6\}$ in $\mathbb Z/9\mathbb Z$. Now we want an automorphism of $\mathbb Z/9\mathbb Z$ that restricts to the identity on both copies of $\mathbb Z/3\mathbb Z$ and makes the diagram commute.

<p>Convergence is non-uniform on any interval such as $(0,c_2]$ where $0$ is a limit point.  In this case the Cauchy criterion for uniform convergence is violated.</p>

"2377117","2383026","<p>You are trying to solve the PDE $F(Du,u,x)=0$ in $U$, with $u=g$ on $\Gamma\subset\partial U$. If the solution you expect to find is a function $u\in C(\overline{U})\cap C^1(U)$ (for example this happens if $g$ is only continuous), then you are right, you do not expect the solution to satisfy the PDE on $\Gamma$. However, if $g$ is $C^1$ and $F$ is a continuous function defined also for $x\in \partial U$, then you expect/hope to find a solution $u\in C^1(\overline{U})$. In this case, if the PDE is satisfied in $U$ and you consider a point $x_0\in \partial U$, then by continuity,
$F(Du(x_0),u(x_0),x_0)=0.$
Now since $u=g$, if, say $\Gamma=\partial U$ is a smooth manifold, then at every point $x_0\in \partial U$ you have a tangent space and for every tangent vector $t$ to $\partial U$ at $x_0$, $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x_0)=\frac{\partial g}{\partial t}(x_0)$. Since the tangent space at $x_0$ has dimension $n-1$, you have that $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t_i}(x_0)$ are determined for $i=1,\ldots, n-1$, where $t_i$ are linearly independent vectors. So only the derivative of $u$ in the normal direction is missing. To find it, you have to use the equation $F(Du(x_0),u(x_0),x_0)=0.$</p>

<p>You started along one path correctly and then fell short of the mark.  Let's proceed as you did starting with  the definition of the integral over $[a,c]$, that for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$ there is a $\delta &gt; 0$ such that  if $P$ is a partition with $\|P\| &lt; \delta$ then </p>

<p>$$\left|S(P,f;[a,c]) - \int_a^cf(x)\, dx\right| &lt; \epsilon.$$</p>

<p>I have introduced the notation $S(P,f;[a,c])$ to indicate the interval on which the partition and sum are defined.</p>

<p>Given $\epsilon &gt; 0$ we have $\delta_1, \delta_2$ such that $\|P_i\| &lt; \delta_i$ for $i = 1,2$ implies</p>

<p>$$\left|S(P_1,f;[a,b]) - \int_a^bf(x)\, dx\right| &lt; \epsilon/3, \\ \left|S(P_2,f;[b,c]) - \int_b^cf(x)\, dx\right| &lt; \epsilon/3, $$</p>

<p>Let $M$ be an upper bound for $|f|$ and take $\delta = \min(\delta_1, \delta_2, \epsilon/6M)$.</p>

<p>Let $P = (x_0,x_1, \ldots, x_{j-1},x_j, \ldots , x_n)$ be a partition of $[a,c]$ with $\|P\| &lt; \delta.$</p>

<p>In general $P$ will not include the point $b$  (if it does the proof is easy).  I will assume WLOG that $x_{j-1} &lt; b &lt; x_j$.  </p>

<p>In this case,</p>

<p>$$S(P,f;[a,c]) = \sum_{k=1}^{j-1}f(\xi_k)(x_k - x_{k-1}) + f(\xi_j)(x_j - x_{j-1}) + \sum_{k=j}^{n}f(\xi_k)(x_k - x_{k-1}),$$</p>

<p>where $\xi_k \in [x_{k-1},x_k]$. Again WLOG I assume $x_{j-1} \leqslant \xi_j &lt; b &lt; x_j$.</p>

<p>Now we can write $f(\xi_j)(x_j - x_{j-1}) = f(\xi_j)(b- x_{j-1}) + (f(\xi_j) - f(b))(x_j - b) + f(b)(x_j - b), $ and</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}S(P,f;[a,c]) &amp;= \underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}f(\xi_k)(x_k - x_{k-1}) + f(\xi_j)(b- x_{j-1})}_{S(P_1,f;[a,b])}\\ &amp;+  (f(\xi_j) - f(b))(x_j - b) \\ &amp;+ \underbrace{\sum_{k=j}^{n}f(\xi_k)(x_k - x_{k-1}) + f(b)(x_j- b)}_{S(P_2,f;[b,c])}\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Hence, since $|f(\xi_j) - f(b)|(x_{j} - b) &lt; 2M\delta &lt; \epsilon/3$,</p>

<p>$$\left|S(P,f;[a,c]) - \left(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx + \int_b^c f(x) \, dx\right)  \right| \\ \leqslant \left|S(P_1,f;[a,b]) - \int_a^b f(x) \, dx  \right|+ |f(\xi_j) - f(b)|(x_{j} - b) + \left|S(P_2,f;[b,c]) - \int_b^c f(x) \, dx  \right| \\ &lt; \epsilon. $$</p>

<p>Thus, $f$ is integrable over $[a,c]$ and</p>

<li>You have subtracted numbers in which there are three or more consecutive even digits more than once.</li>
</ol>

<p>First, we observe that there are $9 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 = 9000$ four-digit positive integers.</p>

<p>Let $A_1$ be the set of four-digit positive integers in which the thousands place and hundreds place contain equal even digits.  Let $A_2$ be the set of four-digit positive integers in which the hundreds place and tens place contain equal even digits.  Let $A_3$ be the set of four-digit positive integers in which the tens place and units place contain equal even digits.  Then $A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3$ is the set of four-digit positive integers that do contain consecutive equal even digits.  By the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion%E2%80%93exclusion_principle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Inclusion-Exclusion Principle</a>, the number of four-digit positive integers that do contain consecutive even digits is 
$$|A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3| = |A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3| - |A_1 \cap A_2| - |A \cap A_3| - |A_2 \cap A_3| + |A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3|$$</p>

<p>$|A_1|$:  Since we cannot use zero, there are four ways of choosing the even digit that occupies both the thousands and hundreds place.  There are ten choices for each of the remaining digits.  Hence, $|A_1| = 4 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 = 400$.</p>

<p>$|A_2|$:  Since we cannot use zero, the thousands place can be filled in nine ways.  There are five ways to choose the even digit that fills both the hundreds and tens places.  There are ten ways to fill the units place.  Hence, $|A_2| = 9 \cdot 5 \cdot 10 = 450$.</p>

<p>$|A_3|$:  We can fill the thousands place in nine ways and the hundreds place in ten ways.  There are five ways to choose the even digit that occupies both the tens and units places.  Hence, $|A_3| = 9 \cdot 10 \cdot 5 = 450$.</p>

<p>$|A_1 \cap A_2|$:  Since we cannot use zero, there are four ways to choose the 
even digit that occupies the thousands, hundreds, and tens places.  There are ten ways to fill the units place.  Hence, $|A_1 \cap A_2| = 4 \cdot 10 = 40$.</p>

<p>$|A_1 \cap A_3|$:  There are four ways to choose the even digit that occupies both the thousands and hundreds places and five ways to choose the even digit that occupies both the tens and units places.  Hence, $|A_1 \cap A_3| = 4 \cdot 5 = 20$.</p>

<p>$|A_2 \cap A_3|$:  There are nine ways to fill the thousands place.  There are five ways to choose the even digit that occupies the hundreds, tens, and units places.  Hence, $|A_2 \cap A_3| = 9 \cdot 5 = 45$.</p>

<p>$|A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3|$:  Since we cannot use zero, there are four ways to choose the even digit that occupies the thousands, hundreds, tens, and units places.  Hence, $|A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3| = 4$. </p>

<p>Therefore, the number of four-digit positive integers that do contain consecutive even equal digits is 
\begin{align*}
|A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3| &amp; = |A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3| - |A_1 \cap A_2| - |A \cap A_3| - |A_2 \cap A_3| + |A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3|\\
                        &amp; = 400 + 450 + 450 - 40 - 20 - 45 + 4\\
                        &amp; = 1199
\end{align*}
Therefore, the number of four-digit positive even integers that do not contain consecutive equal even digits is 
$9000 - 1199 = 7801$.</p>

The next week to the next five, and so on, looping around when you reach the bottom. Then you have seven employees on call every day, and the last of the eight weeks you even have eleven employees on call, so you can make up for that by giving only four employees vacation some of the weeks (four of the weeks, in fact, with five employees the other four).</p>

"2377468","2377483","<p>For a set $A=\{a_n~:~n\in\mathbb N\}$ the supremum and infimum is not the same as the limes superior or limes inferior of the sequence $(a_n)_n$. You might compute a few elements

"
"2377475","2377839","<p>I'm going to deal with the general case for any odd number of vertices and any starting sum (with noted exceptions), because I like giving general solutions :)</p>

<p>Let there be $n$ vertices (where $n$ is odd), labelled $0$ through $n-1$, with vertex $r$ having an associated integer $x_{r}$, and with $\Sigma x = \sum_{r=0}^{n-1}x_{r}$. In your case, $n=5$ and $\Sigma x=2011$.</p>

<p>I also presume that $x_{r}$ can be negative, since the question merely states ""integer"", and because otherwise there are some states that are unwinnable - for example, in your scenario, any state with one vertex having $2010$ and any other having $1$ is unwinnable if $x_{r}\ge0$ is enforced.</p>

<h2>Method:</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Find some function $I$ of $\{x_{r}\}$ that is invariant under the allowed transformations of $\{x_{r}\}$. These transformations take the form:
$$\begin{align}x_{r} &amp;\rightarrow x_{r}-m\\x_{r+1} &amp;\rightarrow x_{r+1}-m\\x_{r+k+1} &amp;\rightarrow x_{r+k+1}+2m\end{align}$$
where $n=2k+1$ and indices are considered modulo $n$. Try building a quantity that is invariant modulo $n$ - you don't need to get too complicated, a linear combination of $\{x_{r}\}$ will suffice. This invariant will never change throughout the game, so it's a useful quantity to know.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the $n$ possible winning states (one for each vertex), and the corresponding values of your invariant - $I_{r}$ being the value of the invariant for the win state where only $x_{r}$ is non-zero. If there are no repeated members in $\{I_{r}\}$, then any initial state can have at most one winning state, since there is at most one winning state you can reach. If $I \notin \{I_{r}\}$, then you cannot win from this state, since you can only reach states that have invariant $I$, and no winning state has invariant $I$. To answer the question, we need $\{I_{r}\}$ to comprise distinct elements, and to contain every possible value of $I$ - hence every state leads to one and only winning state.</p></li>
<li><p>Now plug in values to solve for the specific case (admittedly, I solved for the specific case first then generalised, you might find it easier to do the process with specific values of $n$ and $\Sigma x$ in mind).</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Answer in spoilers below:</h2>

<p>Part 1 (picking an invariant):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Choose the function $I=(\sum_{r=0}^{n-1}rx_{r})\ (\mathrm{mod}\ n)$, which transforms to $I - rm - (r+1)m + (r+k+1)2m\ (\mathrm{mod}\ n) = I + (2r+2k+2-2r-1)m\ (\mathrm{mod}\ n) = I + (2k+1)m\ (\mathrm{mod}\ n) = I$<br>and is hence invariant since it didn't matter what $r$ or $m$ was. It doesn't matter ultimately which vertex is vertex $0$ - while $I$ will depend on the labelling of vertices, it will still indicate the same winning vertex - proof after part 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part 2 (using invariant to deduce possible winning states):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The function's codomain is the set $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, the integers modulo $n$, and we have $I_{r} = r\Sigma x\ (\mathrm{mod}\ n)$. For any $\Sigma x$ coprime with $n$, $\{I_{r}\}$ will be a set equivalent to $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$; the winning state is then the $I_{r}$ that equals $I$ - i.e. the winning vertex is $r = I\cdot(\Sigma x)^{-1} \ (\mathrm{mod}\ n)$, where $(\Sigma x)^{-1}$ is the multiplicative inverse of $\Sigma x$ modulo $n$ - hence why we require $\Sigma x$ coprime to $n$ as otherwise $(\Sigma x)^{-1}$ does not exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proof why labelling doesn't matter (uses results from parts 1 and 2):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> To prove why the choice of which vertex is vertex $0$ is irrelevant, increment all indices by some amount $a$ (and then reduce modulo $n$). $I$ will then increase by $a\Sigma x\ (\mathrm{mod}\ n)$, thus the winning vertex's index will increase by $a\Sigma x(\Sigma x)^{-1}\ (\mathrm{mod}\ n) = a$, so the winning vertex is the same. As long as you label the vertices consecutively, it doesn't matter which vertex you start from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part 3 (solution for specific case):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Now we have the general solution, in your specific case, all we need show is that $2011$ is coprime with $5$; it clearly is, and in fact $2011 = 1\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 5)$, which makes life very easy as its multiplicative inverse is just $1$. Now just compute $I = x_{1}+2x_{2}+3x_{3}+4x_{4}$, and then $I\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 5)$ gives you the winning vertex.</p>

I suppose that you raises the question of convergence for the singular point $x=0$. This would be a serious problem if the lower bound of the integral was $0$.

"2377638","2377666","<p>You can indeed construct an additive, non-linear function $T:\Bbb R\to \Bbb R$ (as vetor spaces over $\Bbb R$, since additive maps of $\Bbb Q$-vector spaces necessarily become linear automatically) by starting with what you have: $T(p) = p$ for $p\in \Bbb Q$, and $T(r) = 0$ for all $r$ with $r/\sqrt2 \in \Bbb Q$. However, constructing it is not easy, and requires the so-called <em>axiom of choice</em> in order to be finalised.</p>

<p>So, we start out with what we already have: some values that $T$ sends to themself, and some values that $T$ sends to $0$. By additivity, this forces $T$ to be defined for a slightly greater class of numbers, namely $T(p + q\sqrt2) = p$, for all rational $p, q$.</p>

<p>But we haven't defined $T$ for all real numbers yet.  Note that whatever else we define $T$ to be, it already cannot be linear. So we just build on it as best we can and ensure that it stays additive. We do this by picking a number for which $T$ isn't already defined, like $\pi$ or $\sqrt 3$ or $\ln 2$ or $e$ or anything else. I'll pick $\pi$ for now. We can make $T(\pi)$ to be whatever we want it to be. I'll pick $3$ because I like $3$. By additivity, $T$ is now forcibly defined to be $T(p+q\sqrt2+r\pi) = p+3r$ for any rational $r$.</p>

<p>However, we are not done definining $T$ yet; there are still many more real numbers to cover. And this is where the axiom of choice comes in: there is no finite way, or even countably infinite way to finalise this definition of $T$. We just have to keep going and going, picking one new real number each step, until we've covered the entire real number line, which requires an uncountably infinite number of steps. The axiom of choice is exactly what allow us to say that even though we cannot finalise our $T$, some finalised $T$ does indeed exist somewhere out there.</p>

"2377674","2377817","<p>Your older brother is probably right that if you just want to pass your class, you don't need to understand everything perfectly. But it sounds like you want to, and there's absolutely no reason you can't attain a really good grasp of Calculus even in high school, if you're willing to put in the effort. </p>

<p>Let me address the second part of your question first: Why doesn't $u\lim_{\delta x\to0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}$ go to $0$? </p>

<p>As $\delta x$ goes to $0$, it's certainly true that $\delta v$ goes to $0$, so at first glance, we might want to say that the whole thing goes to $0$. But since the denominator goes to $0$ as well, that is not necessarily true. We have a very small quantity divided by another very small quantity, and as they both approach $0$, the ratio can approach something nonzero. In fact, the $\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}$ approaches $\frac{dv}{dx}$. Since this is multiplied by $u$, that whole term approaches $u\frac{dv}{dx}$. Similarly with the second term.</p>

<p>Now what is the difference in the third term? Recall the product rule for limits: the limit of a product is the product of the limits (contrast this with the derivative of a product, which is NOT the product of the derivatives, as this very discussion shows). So then: $\lim_{\delta x\to0}\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}\delta v=\lim_{\delta x\to0}\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}\cdot\lim_{\delta x\to0}\delta v=\frac{du}{dx}\cdot0$.</p>

<p>What happened here? The $\delta v$ was not divided by another small quantity, since the $\delta x$ was busy keeping the $\delta u$ in check. So the $\delta v$ just goes to $0$, bringing the whole term to $0$. Note that we could have also written this term as $\delta u\cdot\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}$. In that case, the $\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}$ would have gone to $\frac{dv}{dx}$, but the $\delta u$ would have gone to $0$. The point is that the $\delta x$ can only take care of one thing at a time.</p>

<p>Another way to look at it is this: Suppose $\frac{du}{dx}=5$. (or any other number). Eventually, with $\delta x$ small enough, we will have $\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}$ really close to $5$. Say we make $\delta x$ small enough that $\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}$ is between $4.9$ and $5.1$. Then we can also make $\delta x$ small enough that $\delta v$ is close to $0$. Say we make $\delta x$ small enough that $\delta v$ is between $-.00001$ and $.00001$. Then $\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}\delta v$ is at most $5.1$ times $.00001$, which is really close to $0$. You can probably see how making $\delta x$ even smaller makes this quantity even closer to $0$. In fact, you can make the quantity as close to $0$ as you want, just by making $\delta x$ small. And that's exactly what it means for the limit of the whole term to be $0$.</p>

Let $\iota_{x, r}$ be the operation of inversion in the sphere $S_X[x; r] := \lbrace y \in X : \|y - x\| = r \rbrace$. For a subset $\emptyset \neq Q \subseteq X$, we'll denote by $c(Q)$ the centre of the ball of minimal radius that envelopes $Q$ (where $Q$ is bounded), and denote by $C(Q)$ the set of centres of balls of maximal radius that are contained in $Q$. Furthermore, we denote $r(Q)$ and $R(Q)$ to be the respective radii of these balls.</p>

<p>Let us consider the case where the interior of $Q$ is non-empty and $C(Q) \neq \emptyset$ (otherwise the problem becomes somewhat silly). So, in particular, $R(Q) &gt; 0$. Let $y \in C(Q)$, consider the image of the set $X \setminus Q$ under the operation $\iota_{y, R(Q)}$, and call it $A_y$. Then $y = c(A_y)$.</p>

<p>How does this work? Proving it requires some tedious algebra, but can be understood well enough with some geometry. When in an inner product space (or indeed, a Hilbert space), the operation $\iota_{x, r}$ preserves ""generalised spheres"", meaning spheres and hyperplanes. So, every sphere maps to a sphere or hyperplane (and the same for hyperplanes). A sphere will only map to a hyperplane if the sphere goes through $x$, the centre of the sphere in which you are inverting. Note also that $\iota_{x,r}$ is an involution, meaning that $\iota_{x, r}^2 = I$.</p>

<p>Moreover, if you map a ball containing $x$ in its interior under $\iota_{x, r}$, then the image will be the (unbounded) complement of another ball. If the ball does not contain $x$ in its interior, then it will map to another ball (not of the same centre). If $x$ is on the sphere of the ball, then the ball maps to a half-space.</p>

<p>Here's something to note about $A_y$: it is contained in $B[y; R(Q)]$. This is because we inverted in the sphere the set $X \setminus Q$, which was entirely contained outside the sphere, so the resulting set $A_y$ lies in the ball. From this, we conclude that $r(A_y) \le R(Q)$.</p>

<p>Another fact about $A_y$ is that, given any ball $B$ containing $A_y$, we must have $y \in \operatorname{int}(B)$. This can be deduced by the geometric facts above. It therefore follows that any ball containing $A_y$ will map to the complement of a ball, where the ball is contained in $Q$. It takes some formulae to prove formally, but the smaller the ball containing $A_y$, the larger the ball inside $Q$. Where they achieve their common optimisation is at $y$, with radius $R(Q)$.</p>

<p>So, in conclusion, we can take any Chebyshev centre (of one type) $y \in C(Q)$, perform an involution on the set (mapping under an inversion, then taking the complement) to recover a set $A_y$ whose (unique) Chebyshev centre (of the other type) is also $y$. It's not much of a duality, but it's something.</p>

<p>Aside: These techniques were used to make some of the most significant progress on the Chebyshev conjecture, and originally attributed to F. A. Ficken. Using these techniques, a non-convex Chevyshev set (a set for which each point has a unique closest point in the set) could be turned into a uniquely remotal set (a set for which each point has a unique furthest point in the set).</p>

<p>One way to normalize a matrix such that it's largest eigenvalue is equal to 1 is to divide the matrix by that eigenvalue. If I write the normalized matrix $U$ as $\hat{U}$, this is accomplished by

"2377865","2377909","<p>First off, let me preface this post with the very important note that the notion that Cantor discusses has <em>nothing</em> to do with the term $\infty$ that appears in calculus, nor with the various geometric notions of ""at infinity"" such as seen in inversive geometry or projective geometry.</p>

<hr>

<p>Cantor's notion of <em>cardinal number</em> is about quantifying <em>sets</em> up to <em>bijection</em>. We call this quantity the <em>cardinality</em> of a set.</p>

<p>A bijection is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the sets: for example, we can write down a bijection between the natural numbers and the primes as follows:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{matrix} 
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \ldots
\\ \updownarrow &amp; \updownarrow &amp; \updownarrow &amp; \updownarrow &amp; 
\\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 7 &amp; \ldots
 \end{matrix} 
$$</p>

<p>Formally, a bijection from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ is a function $f$ from $X$ to $Y$ with the property that $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $x=y$. (here, ""function"" is meant in the precise set-theoretic sense)</p>

<p>When there exists a bijection between two sets, we say they are <em>equipollent</em>. (or <em>bijective</em> or <em>isomorphic</em>)</p>

<p>In the case of <em>finite sets</em>, it's pretty easy to see that two sets are equipollent if and only if they have the same size &mdash; we can just list out the elements side by side. Thus, we can quantify the finite sets by using natural numbers.</p>

<p>Cantor's key insight is that this notion applies equally well to infinite sets: e.g. the set of natural numbers and the set of primes described above are equipollent, as shown by the correspondence indicated above.</p>

<p>Thus, these two sets are quantified by the same cardinal number; we call it  $\aleph_0$. </p>

<p>The ""surprise"" turns out to be that $\aleph_0$ doesn't quantify <em>all</em> infinite sets &mdash; there are infinite sets that are not equipollent to the natural numbers! Consequently, there are many different infinite cardinal numbers in addition to the familiar $\aleph_0$.</p>

<p>With the benefit of hindsight this maybe shouldn't be so surprising &mdash; it's just that people have spent millenia with just a single word for quantifying non-finite sets, so it's suddenly shocking when it's discovered there are more refined things you can say!</p>

"2377942","2378167","<p>Not always.  Suppose $P(X=\nu)=1$, where $\nu$ is a constant, different from $\mu;$ in other words $F=\delta_\nu.$  Since $F$ is an extreme point in the space of probability measures, both $G$ and $H$ must equal $F$.  But the expectation of $G$ is then wrong.</p>

<p>More elaborately, let $F= (\delta_0 + \delta_1)/2$ put half its mass at $0$ and half at $1$.  Then $G$ and $H$ must also be supported on $\{0,1\}$, and hence $P(Y=1) = \mu$ and thus $P(Y=0)=1-\mu$.  Already we know that $\mu$ must satisfy $0\le\mu\le1$.
Similarly, $P(Z=1)$ must then solve $1/2 = p\mu + P(Z=1)$ which implies $$0 \le \frac{1/2-\mu p}{1-p} \le 1.$$</p>

<p>If I can think of a simple condition involving $F$, $p$, and $\mu$ alone, allowing a decomposition, I'll post it.</p>

<p>ADDED 2 hours later.  </p>

<p>Suppose $F$ is continuous, with support $\mathbb R$.  Since $F$ is a non trivial mixture of $G$ and $H$, we have $G\ll F$ and $H\ll F$, and thus $G$ and $H$ have Radon-Nikodym derivatives with respect to $F:$ call them
$\gamma$ and $\eta$.  The desired decomposition  thus requires $p\gamma(x) +(1-p)\eta(x)=1$ for almost all (w.r.t. $F$) values of $x$,
and $\int_{\mathbb R} \gamma(x) F(dx)=\int_{\mathbb R} \eta(x) F(dx) = 1$ and $\int_{\mathbb R} x \gamma(x) F(dx)=\mu$.  And, of course, $\gamma(x)\ge 0$ and $\eta(x)\ge 0$, for almost all $x$.This is, in a sense, a linear programming problem (or feasibility problem).  The unknown function $\eta$ can be eliminated from this setup by noting that given $\gamma$, we find $\eta=(1-p\gamma)/(1-p)$, and the non-negativity constraint on $\eta$ can be transferred to $\gamma$ by requiring $0\le \gamma(x) \le 1/p$.</p>

<p>I think the following sketch shows when such a $\gamma$ exists.  For each $t\in [0,1-p]$ let $A(t) = F^{-1}(1-p-t)$ and $B(t) = F^{-1}(1-t)$.  Thus, $p$ of $X$'s mass lies between $A(t)$ and $B(t)$, and $t$ of the mass lies above $B(t)$.  Now consider the decreasing  function $m(t) = \int_{A(t)}^{B(t)} x F(dx)/p$.  If $\mu = m(t)$ for some $t$, we are done: let $\gamma=I_{[A(t),B(t)]}/p$.  If there is no such $t$, I <em>think</em> the problem is infeasible.  Which could happen if $\mu$ is too big.</p>

"
"2377966","2378134","<p>The answer might be a bit more complicated, as it depends a little on what you actually want to solve. In particular, is this a functional equation on the real variable $x$ or is $x$ restricted to be an  integer? In any case the solution is not unique without specifying more details.</p>

<p>If the latter is the case, we are simply dealing with a recurrence relation:
$$
f(n) = k f(n-1) - f(n-2)
$$
with the characteristic polynomial
$$
x^2 - k x + 1 =0
$$
which has the roots
$$
\lambda_\pm = \frac{k \pm \sqrt{k^2-4}}{2}
$$
and the general solution
$$
f(n) = c_+ \lambda_+^n + c_- \lambda_-^n
$$
for some constants $c_+$ and $c_-$. Their values would follow from two given functional values, which need to be stated in order to have a unique solution. Note that for $k^2 &lt; 4$ the roots are complex and that there is a special case for $k=\pm 2$ where things are slightly modified.</p>

<p>If the problem is actually a functional equation that is to be solved for $x \in {\mathbb R}$, it gets more interesting and there are many different types of solutions that can be continuous and/or discontinous.</p>

<p>For instance we can find the solution
$$
f(x) = g(x) ~\left(\lambda_+\right)^x 
$$
which is valid for any periodic function $g(x)=g(x+1)$. This is easier to see if we introduce constants $\alpha_\pm$ such that $\lambda_\pm = e^{\alpha_\pm}$, because inserting this in the functional equations gives:
$$
f(x-1) + f(x+1) = g(x-1)e^{\alpha_+ (x-1)} + g(x+1)e^{\alpha_+ (x+1)} \\= g(x) e^{\alpha_+ (x-1)} \left( 1 + e^{2 \alpha_+} \right) \\= g(x) e^{\alpha_+ (x-1)} \left( k e^{\alpha_+} \right) \\= k f(x)
$$
A whole family of real, continuous solutions is for instance given by
$$
f(x) = \cos(2 \pi k x + \delta) \left( e^{\alpha_+ x} + e^{\alpha_- x} \right)
$$
for any constant $\delta$ and integer $k$. This also means that there is no unique answer unless additional restrictions to the solution are given.</p>

<p>As to solving these type of problems that depends a bit on whether it is a sequence of numbers or a problem on functions. For functional equations is often looking for fixed points $f(c)=c$ or symmetries such as $f(x)=-x$. Sometimes it is possible to take suitable derivatives or special combinations in multi-variable equations. Another approach is to make an expansion in the vicinity of a fixed point that might reveal a clue to the solution. In general I am inclined to say that these problems are rather tough and that there is no generic strategy that will work, but that it requires creativity to solve them and of course practice helps a lot. </p>

<p>Banach-Tarski theorem shows that some conditions imposed on the volume (or mass) cannot hold simultaneously. I think that the answer to your Question 2 depends on which properties mass should have. Do we require that each set have a mass? Is mass translation and rotation invariant? That is, is mass $m(B)$ of a copy $B$ of a set $A$, which is shifted and rotated with respect to the set $A$ the same as mass $m(A)$ of the set $A$? Ignoring mass invariance we can simply define it via delta function, choosing a point $x_0$ and setting $m(A)=1$ if $A$ contains $x_0$ and $m(A)=0$, otherwise. </p>

<p>Which additivity properties should have a mass? I mean the following. If $A$ is a union of a disjoint  family $\{A_i: i\in I\}$ then $A$ have mass and $m(A)=\sum \{m(A_i): i\in I\}$. Usually it is required that this property takes place for each finite $I$ (additivity) of each countable $I$ ($\sigma$-additivity). I remark that since the group $\Bbb R^3$ is abelian, it is so-called amenable and it admits finitely additive (but not necessarily $\sigma$-additive) translation invariant (but not necessarily rotation invariant) non-trivial mass (that is $m(\Bbb R^3)=1$) which is defined on <em>each</em> subset $A$ of $\Bbb R^3$. </p>

<p>A demand that mass additivity holds for uncountable cardinality of the set $I$ may lead to the following paradox. Let $A$ be an uncountable set. If uncountably many points of $A$ has positive mass, how we sum these values to obtain mass of $A$? Conversely, if each point of $A$ has mass $0$, then how can mass of $A$ be non-zero? Even mass $\sigma$-additivity with its translation invariance can lead to contradictions, similarly to that used in a construction of a non-measurable <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitali_set"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vitali</a> set.</p>

<p>The above paradoxes may lead to a conclusion that the mass is a property not of each set and it is not concentrated in points, similarly to other physical notions. I recall Zeno “arrow” aporia on motion. When a flying arrow moves if at each moment it has a fixed position? Also how time can have duration if it is composed of moments none of which has duration? </p>

"2378032","2378046","<p>Your descriptions of the intersection and the difference are incorrect.  When intersecting two events, you should think ""$A\cap B$ is the event that both $A$ and $B$ occur.""

$$ A\cap B : \text{exactly one odd number is selected}.$$</p>

<p>For the difference, think ""$A\setminus B$ is the event that $A$ happens, but not $B$.""  In this case, you select at least one odd number (event $A$), but not 0 or 1 odd numbers (the event ""not $B$"").  Thus

"2378122","2378159","<p>Let $f(t) = \mu \{ t \}$. </p>

<p>Suppose $\mu \{ x \} = 0$ and $f'(x) \neq 0$ (by which we mean $f'(x)$ might not exist). Then there is $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that arbitrarily close to $x$ there exists $y$ with $\mu \{ y \} \geqslant \varepsilon |y-x|$. </p>

<p>There is at most countably many $y$ with $\mu \{ y \} &gt; 0$ - if there is finitely many, of course $f$ is a.e. differentiable, otherwise arrange all such $y$ into a sequence $y_m$. Then $$\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \mu \{ y_m \} = \mu( \{ y_m : m \geqslant 1 \} ) \leqslant 1.$$ </p>

<p>Now, for $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ let $I_m^{\varepsilon} = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : \mu \{ y_m \} \geqslant \varepsilon |y_m-x| \}$ so $I_m^{\varepsilon}$ is an interval of radius $\frac{\mu \{ y_m \}}{\varepsilon}$ centered at $y_m$. By the remark in the beginning</p>

<p>As the series $\displaystyle \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \mu \{ y_m \}$ converges, the above tends to $0$ as $n \to \infty$. Therefore</p>

<p>$$\lambda \left( \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} \bigcup_{m=n}^{\infty} I_m^{\varepsilon} \right) = 0$$</p>

<p>$$\mathcal{C} = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} C_n$$ </p>

<p>Now define a measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}$ to be $\frac{1}{2}|I_m|$ on $y_m$ and $0$ on $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{ y_m : m \geqslant 1 \}$. Note that $\mu$ is a probability measure and each $I_m$ is exactly $I_m^1$ from the proof above. Since each $a \in \mathcal{C}$ belongs to intervals $I_m^1$ of arbitrarily small length, $f$ is not differentiable in any point $a \in \mathcal{C}$. </p>

<p>The construction can be slightly modified to replace the Cantor set with a dense $G_{\delta}$ set.</p>

"2378125","2378131","<p>It is possible to have a set $S$ which satisfies (1), (2), and (3').  Indeed, let $A$ be any nonempty set.  Recursively define $A_0=A$ and $A_{n+1}=A_n\cup\{\{a_1,a_2\}:a_1,a_2\in A_n\}$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$.  Then $S=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} A_n$ is a set which contains $A$ and satisfies (3'), since for any $a_1,a_2\in S$, there are $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $a_1\in A_m$ and $a_2\in A_n$, and then $\{a_1,a_2\}\in A_{\max(m,n)+1}\subseteq S$.  It follows that $S$ also satisifes (2) by taking $a_1=a_2=a$.</p>

<p>More generally, a similar construction works for any version of (3) where you put a bound on the cardinality of the indexing set $I$, by iterating this process by a transfinite induction whose length has cofinality greater than $|I|$. For instance, if you wanted $S$ to actually contain all finite subsets of itself, you could do the same construction with $A_{n+1}=A_n\cup\{F:F\subseteq A_n\text{ and $F$ is finite}\}$.  Or if you wanted $S$ to contain all countable subsets of itself, you could do an induction of length $\omega_1$ where $A_{\alpha+1}=A_\alpha\cup\{C:C\subseteq A_\alpha\text{ and $C$ is countable}\}$.</p>

"2378133","2379515","<p>The interpolation norm seems to derive its name from the fact that it is sort of an `interpolation' between the $l_2$ and $l_1$ norms.

"
"2378149","2378375","<p>Let me formalize and generalize the problem. You have a sequence of $n$
random variables, $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n,$ such that $X_i \sim U[0,1]$ for each $i.$ Let $X = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i.$
That is, $X$ is a <em>uniform sum distribution</em> with parameter $n.$</p>

<p>Then the number of points scored is $1 + Y,$ where
$$
 Y =
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if } X &lt; n/2,
\\ 
0 &amp; \text{if } X \geq n/2.
\end{cases}
$$</p>

<p>That is, $Y=1$ if the mean of the $n$ uniform random variables is less than $\frac12,$ and $Y=0$ otherwise.</p>

<p>In order to keep the discussion relatively simple, I'll assume the values of $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are revealed one at a time, and that the ""point value"" of a number $q$ at any given time is the amount you should be willing to ""pay"" in order to replace the next random variable with the number $q.$</p>

<p>You can also apply formulas based on this interpretation to a situation in which you have some kind of opportunity to choose the values of one or more of $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ and then allow the remaining variables to be assigned randomly.</p>

<p>Now suppose the values of $h$ of the variables are known
(already randomly revealed or chosen by you), that is,
we know that $X_1 = x_1, \ldots, X_h = x_h,$
and suppose you have the opportunity to set an additional $k$ variables
to a certain sequence of values,
$X_{h+1} = x_{h+1}, \ldots, X_{h+k} = x_{h+k}.$
The ""point value"" of the sequence $(x_{h+1}, \ldots, x_{h+k})$
under those conditions is the difference between the expected value of $1+Y$ given that all $h+k$ of these variables are known to have the specified values and the expected value of $1+Y$ given only the first $h$ variables.
But the (conditional) expected value of $1+Y$ is just $1$ plus the (conditional) expected value of $Y$, so
\begin{multline}
V(x_{h+1}, \ldots, x_{h+k}) =
E(Y \mid X_1 = x_1 \land \cdots\land X_{h+k} = x_{h+k}) \\
 - E(Y \mid X_1 = x_1 \land \cdots\land X_h = x_h)
\end{multline}
In other words, the point value of the $k$ additional numbers is the amount by which we increase the conditional expectation of $Y$ when we include those $k$ numbers in the condition.</p>

<p>For example, with $h=0$ and $k=1$ we are assessing the point value of choosing the value of $X_1$ before any of the values are known.
The point value of the numerical value $x_1$ in those circumstances is
$$ V(x_1) = E(Y \mid X_1 = x_1 ) - E(Y) . $$</p>

<p>The conditional expectation $E(Y \mid X_1 = x_1)$ is the probability that after the remaining $n-1$ variables are chosen randomly, the total
(including $x_1$) will not exceed $n/2$; that is,
$$ E(Y \mid X_1 = x_1) = P\left(X_2+\cdots+X_n &lt; \frac n2 - x_1\right).$$</p>

<p>The probability on the right-hand side depends on a uniform sum distribution with parameter $n-1.$
For convenience, let $F_m$ be the cumulative distribution function of
a uniform sum distribution with parameter $m.$
Then
$$
P\left(X_2+\cdots+X_n &lt; \frac n2 - x_1\right) 
= F_{n-1}\left(\frac n2 - x_1\right).
$$
Of course 
$$E(Y) = P\left(X_1+\cdots+X_n &lt; \frac n2\right)
 = F_n\left(\frac n2\right) = 0.5.$$</p>

<p>The following table gives some approximate values of this probability when $n=5$ (as in the original question):</p>

<p>\begin{array}{lc}
x_1 &amp; E(Y \mid X_1 = x_1) \\
0   &amp; 0.7995\\
0.2 &amp; 0.6920\\
0.4 &amp; 0.5663\\
0.5 &amp; 0.5000\\
0.6 &amp; 0.4337\\
0.8 &amp; 0.3080\\
1   &amp; 0.2005\\
\end{array}</p>

<p>That is, in these circumstances the point value of $0$ is approximately $0.2995$ and the point value of $1$ is approximately $-0.2995,$
that is, we should desire to be paid at least $0.2995$ before we would be willing to choose to set $X_1 = 1.$</p>

<p>Going back to the general case in which $h$ variables have already been set
to the values $x_1, \ldots, x_h,$ we can show that
$$
V(x_{h+1}, \ldots, x_{h+k}) =
F_{n-h-k}\left(\frac n2 - (x_1 + \cdots + x_{h+k})\right)
 - F_{n-h}\left(\frac n2 - (x_1 + \cdots + x_h)\right).
$$</p>

<p>This is a general formula covering all cases of this kind;
the fly in the ointment is that the formula for $F_m$ can be a bit
annoying to work with. For the first few uniform sum distributions,
the cumulative probability functions are:</p>

<p>But observe that the square root is not defined for values such that $2t\gt x^2$. This gives us a hint about what's going on here. The characteristics are parabolas, $x^2/2-t=c_2$ for which $u$ is constant and the boundary conditions we are imposing ($u(x,0)=\cos x$) say nothing about the parabolas not crosing the $x$ axis, e.g. $x^2/2-t=-1$, so, we can give any value to $u$ along such parabolas and we will not contradict the initial conditions.

<p>The formulae are too long to type and I shall go to the results (obtained by successive eliminations) $$f=\frac{2 a c+b d \cos (\phi )}{2 c^2}$$ $$e=\frac{a d \cos (\theta -\phi )+b c \cos (\theta )}{c^2}$$ and we end with an equation for $\theta$
$$a d (a d \sin (2 (\theta -\phi ))+2 b c \sin (2 \theta -\phi ))+b^2 c^2 \sin (2

"
"2378184","2378479","<p>No, it's possible for two entirely different sequences in $\beta\omega$ to have the same limit with respect to some ultrafilter $p$. A rather silly example is obtained by taking any sequence $(s_n)$ of distinct points in $\beta\omega$ and any non-principal $p\in\beta\omega$, and then letting $(t_n)$ be the constant sequence with all $t_n$ equal to the $p$-limit of $(s_n)$.</p>

<p>But there are also serious examples. Among the most important of these are those arising from idempotent ultrafilters.  A nonoprincipal ultrafilter $p$ on $\omega$ is called idempotent if the sequence of translates $(p+n)_{n\in\omega}$ has $p$-limit equal to $p$ itself.  (Here $p+n$ is defined as the ultrafilter generated by the $n$-translates $A+n=\{a+n:a\in  A\}$ of all the sets $A\in p$.)  Note that any $p\in\beta\omega$ is the $p$-limit of the sequence $(n)_{n\in\omega}$ of principal ultrafilters.  So an idempotent ultrafilter $p$ is simultaneously the $p$-limit of a sequence of principal ultrafilters and of a sequence of nonprincipal ultrafilters.</p>

<p>The existence of idempotent ultrafilters is a nontrivial result (a special case of a theorem of Ellis about existence of idempotent elements in compact semi-topological semigroups). The proof can be found in many places, for example in a survey paper of mine available at <a href=""http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~ablass/ufdyn.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~ablass/ufdyn.pdf</a> (see Theorem 2 and its corollary).

$$
\Sigma = \pmatrix{\sigma_1\\&amp;\sigma_2 \\ &amp; &amp; \sigma_3}, \qquad \sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \sigma_3

"2378239","2378271","<p>I will apply the standard techniques of quantum field theory.  Begin with,
$$
I^\mu(x^\mu) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_\mu} \int \frac{d^dp}{(2\pi)^d} \frac{e^{-ix\cdot p} }{p^2} \delta^{(d)}(p).
$$
(I denote a vector with an index notation basically because I am used to that from physics.)  Introduce a so-called Schwinger parameterisation,
$$
I^\mu(x^\mu) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_\mu} \int \frac{d^dp}{(2\pi)^d} \int_0^\infty d\tau e^{-ix\cdot p - \tau p^2} \delta^{(d)}(p).

Interchange(!) the order of integration which allows one to use the $\delta$-function,
$$
I^\mu(x^\mu) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^d}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_\mu}\int_0^\infty d\tau=0.
$$
As is common with this technique, the integral is regularised to zero.  I have not checked in detail here but generally speaking: It is permitted to interchange the order of integrals by completing the square of the exponential and moving to spherical polar coordinates then analytically continuing $d$ into the complex plane.</p>

"2378336","2379375","<p>A candidate Lyapunov function should always at least be semi-positive definite, so $V(\vec{x})\geq 0\ \forall\ \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. In order to say something about the stability of the system the time derivative of this Lyapunov function should then at least be semi-negative definite, so $\dot{V}(\vec{x})\leq 0\ \forall\ \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. One can view the Lyapunov function as a sort of virtual energy of the system, with lowest energy state set as zero. If the Lyapunov function is always greater or equal to zero and its derivative always smaller of equal to zero, then the value of the Lyapunov function should always decrease or stay constant.</p>

Suppose $X$ is a space and $U$ and $V$ are open subspaces of $X$ with $U\cup V=X$.  Then there is a long exact sequence of homology groups \begin{align*}\dots &amp; \to H_n(U\cap V)\to H_n(U)\oplus H_n(V)\to H_n(X)
\\
 &amp;\to H_{n-1}(U\cap V)\to H_{n-1}(U)\oplus H_{n-1}(V)\to H_{n-1}(X)\\

In this sequence, the map $H_n(U\cap V)\to H_n(U)\oplus H_n(V)$ is given by $x\mapsto (i_*(x),-j_*(x))$ where $i:U\cap V\to U$ and $j:U\cap V\to V$ are the inclusion maps.  The map $H_n(U)\oplus H_n(V)\to H_n(X)$ is given by $(y,z)\mapsto k_*(y)+\ell_*(z)$, where $k:U\to X$ and $\ell:V\to X$ are the inclusion maps.</p>

<p>In your case where $X$ is two tori glued together, you can take $U$ to be a small open neighborhood of the left torus and $V$ to be a small open neighborhood of right torus, so $U$ and $V$ both deformation-retract to the tori and $U\cap V$ deformation-retracts to the intersection of the two tori, which is a disjoint union of two circles.  The inclusion map $U\cap V\to U$ is nullhomotopic (both circles enclose disks in the left torus), but the inclusion map $U\cap V\to V$ sends both generators of $H_1(U\cap V)\cong \mathbb{Z}^2$ to one of the generators of $H_1(V)\cong \mathbb{Z}^2$ (since the two circles in $U\cap V$ are both meridans of the right torus).</p>

<p>We can then compute $H_2(X)$ using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence $$H_2(U\cap V)\to H_2(U)\oplus H_2(V)\to H_2(X)\to H_1(U\cap V)\to H_1(U)\oplus H_1(V)$$ which becomes $$0\to \mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}\to H_2(X)\to \mathbb{Z}^2\to \mathbb{Z}^2\oplus\mathbb{Z}^2.$$  The last map sends both $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ to $(0,0,-1,-1)$ by the analysis of the inclusion maps $U\cap V\to U$ and $U\cap V\to V$ of the previous paragraph.  In particular, its kernel is generated by $(1,-1)$ and is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$, so we have a short exact sequence $$0\to\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}\to H_2(X)\to\mathbb{Z}\to 0$$ which gives $H_2(X)\cong \mathbb{Z}^3$.</p>

   Bernoulli  random  variables. Apply  Fubini  on   the space

<p>Indeed, the main difficulty lies on the fact that we know that for any $\varepsilon= \left(\varepsilon_n\right)\in\{-1,1\}^n$, there exists $\Omega_\varepsilon$ such that $\mathbb P\left(\Omega_\varepsilon\right)=1$ and for all $\omega\in\Omega_\varepsilon$, the series  $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\varepsilon_n X_n\left(\omega\right)$ converges. But it is not clear whether we can find $\widetilde\Omega$ of probability one which works for <em>any</em> choice of sequences. </p>

<p>Denote $\left(\Omega,\mathcal A,\mathbb P\right)$ the original probability space. On an other probability space $\left(\Omega',\mathcal A',\mathbb P'\right)$, we consider a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables $\left(B_n\right)_{n\geqslant 1}$ such that $\mathbb P'\left(B_n=1\right)=\mathbb P'\left(B_n=-1\right)=1/2$. Denote 
$$E:=\left\{\left(\omega,\omega'\right): \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} B_n\left(\omega'\right)X_n\left(\omega \right)\mbox{ does not converge}                           \right\}.$$
Now appling Fubini's theorem to the indicator function of $E$, we get the existence of $\Omega_0\subset\Omega  $ such that $\mathbb P\left(\Omega_0\right)=1$ and for all $\omega\in\Omega_0$, the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty B_n\left(\omega'\right)X_n\left(\omega\right)$ converges for almost every $\omega\in\Omega'$. Now, use the three series theorem to show that if for some deterministic sequence $\left(a_n\right)_{n\geqslant 1}$, the        $\sum_n a_nB_n\left(\omega'\right)$ converges for almost every $\omega\in\Omega'$, then $\sum_n a_n^2$ is finite.                              </p>

"
"2378493","2378608","<p>I spotted a few problems in your attempt (props for posting the details as that makes it easier to gauge where you are in your studies).</p>

<p>The factor $x+1$ can pretty much be ignored as it won't affect neither the splitting fields nor the Galois groups. You are really only looking at the splitting fields of the other factor $p(x)=3x^3+1$. This cubic has as its complex zeros $x_j=\omega^j\root3\of{-1/3}$, where $j=0,1,2$ and $\omega=(-1+i\sqrt3)/2$ is a primitive third root of unity. So a splitting field $L$ of $p(x)$ over $\Bbb{Q}$ is $L=\Bbb{Q}(\root3\of3,\omega)$. In other words, this is the same splitting field that the polynomial $x^3-3$. The Galois group is isomorphic to $S_3$, and $[L:\Bbb{Q}]=6$. The arguments proving those facts are undoubtedly familiar to you from the standard example of the splitting field of $x^3-2$ over $\Bbb{Q}$ so I won't rehash them. You seem to have made the mistake of including $i$ and $\root6\of3$ into the splitting field. That is not unnatural given that $\sqrt{-3}$ and $\root3\of3$ are in there, but you cannot actually get the real sixth root of $3$ by combining those (but you do get a sixth root of $-3$).</p>

<hr>

<p>Over the field $\Bbb{F}_5$ a splitting field $L_2$ is much smaller. You apparently missed (due to numerical errors) that $p(2)=25=0\in\Bbb{F}_5$, so we get a factorization
$$
p(x)=(x-2)(3x^2+x+2)\in\Bbb{F}_5[x].
$$
That quadratic is irreducible over $\Bbb{F}_5$. To see that you can either verify that it has no zeros in $\Bbb{F}_5$, or you can check that the discriminant
$$\Delta=b^2-4ac=1^2-4\cdot3\cdot 2=-23=2$$
has no square root in $\Bbb{F}_5$. I outlined a different way of reaching the same conclusion in the comments: because $\Bbb{F}_5^*$ is cyclic of order $4$ the element $-1/3$ has a single cube root in there.</p>

<p>Anyway, over $\Bbb{F}_5$ the splitting field is thus $L_2=\Bbb{F}_5(\sqrt\Delta)=\Bbb{F}_{25}$. Therefore $Gal(L_2/\Bbb{F}_5$ is cyclic of order two.</p>

<hr>

<p>You were also interested in the relation between these two Galois groups,
$G_1=Gal(L/\Bbb{Q})$ and $G_2=Gal(L_2/\Bbb{F}_5)$. A relation can be described using concepts of algebraic number theory. Let $\mathcal{O}_L$ be the ring of algebraic integers in $L$. It turns out that in that ring the ideal $(5)$ can be written as a product of three prime ideals
$$
(5)=\mathfrak{p}_1\mathfrak{p}_2\mathfrak{p}_3.
$$
All those prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_j, j=1,2,3,$ have $5$ as an element, and all the quotient rings $\mathcal{O}_l/\mathfrak{p}_j$ are actually isomorphic to $L_2$.  Furthermore, if $\sigma\in G_1$ then $\sigma$ must also permute the three prime ideals. It then turns out that the point stabilizers of that action are all isomorphic to $G_2$. If $\sigma(\mathfrak{p}_1)=\mathfrak{p}_1$, then $\sigma$ induces an automorphism $\overline{\sigma}$ of $\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{p}_1\simeq L_2$. A non-trivial fact is that the mapping
$\sigma\mapsto \overline{\sigma}$ is surjective onto $G_2$. The kernel of this mapping measures the ramification of a prime. The fact that five is not a factor of the discriminant of $p(x), \Delta=-972,$ is the key here. It implies that $p=5$ is unramified. This allows us to identify $G_2$ as a subgroup of $G_1$.</p>

<p>Note that $S_n$ induces an isometry from $\mathbb R^s$ to $\mathrm{Sym}_n$, so we can identify $G$ with the map $\mathrm{Sym}(n)\to M_{m,n}$ given by $P\mapsto AP$. Thus $\lambda\geq0$ is a singular value of $G$ iff there exists a nonzero $P\in\mathrm{Sym}_n$ such that $\langle AQ,AP\rangle=\lambda^2\langle Q,P\rangle$ for all $Q\in\mathrm{Sym}_n$. That is,

"2378592","2378607","<p>Note that your dual basis is given by nothing but the evaluation at the $4$ points $-1,0,1,2$. By very definition of dual basis, you want to find $4$ linearly independent vectors in your base space, such that
$$\phi_i(v_j)=\delta_{ij},$$</p>

<p>In other words, you want to find $4$ linearly independent polynomials of degree smaller equal $3$ such that each vanishes at exactly $3$ of the four evaluation points $-1,0,1,2$ and such that the evaluation at the fourth point is $1$.</p>

<p>Writing the candidate polynomial as
$$f(x)=a(x-b)(x-c)(x-d)$$
makes it clear that for $f$ to vanish for example at $-1,0,1$ it must be of the form
$$f(x)=a(x+1)(x)(x-1)$$
and lastly evaluating it at $2$ gives the value of $a$, namely
$$f(2)=a(2+1)(2)(2-1)=6a\overset{!}{=}1\Rightarrow a=\frac16$$
hence the first basis element is
$$f(x)=\frac16(x+1)(x)(x-1).$$
The same reasoning applies for the remaining $3$.</p>

<p>Of course one shall last argue that these are indeed linearly independent. But if $B^\ast$ is known to be a (dual) basis, then this immediate.</p>

"2378616","2378622","<p>This function is <em>the</em> example of a function which is differentiable everywhere, but where the derivative isn't continuous.

If you think of the derivative as the slope of a line that approximates the function, rather than some algebraic limit of a fraction, this is easier to grasp.</p>

<p>However, <em>close</em> to $0$, the function $f$ oscillates up and down ever faster.

"2378635","2379169","<p>Let's investigate the equation $$\sum_{i=0}^n (n+i)^{x_n}=(2n+1)^{x_n}:$$ As $i$ goes from $0$ to $n$, $n+i$ goes from $n$ to $2n$. If we reorder the sum upside down, and divide both sides by $(2n+1)^{x_n}$, we get
$$\sum_{k=1}^{n+1}\left(\frac{2n+1-k}{2n+1}\right)^{x_n}=\sum_{k=1}^{n+1}\left(1-\frac{k}{2n+1}\right)^{x_n}=1.$$ Using the elementary inequality $$1-\frac{k}{2n+1}\le\left(1-\frac1{2n+1}\right)^k$$ and setting $$\lambda_n=\left(1-\frac1{2n+1}\right)^{x_n},$$ the equation gives $$1\le\sum_{k=1}^{n+1}(\lambda_n)^k&lt;\sum_{k=1}^\infty(\lambda_n)^k=\frac{\lambda_n}{1-\lambda_n}.$$ So $\lambda_n&gt;1/2,$ meaning $$x_n&lt;\frac{\ln 2}{\ln\frac1{1-1/(2n+1)}}&lt;(2n+1)\ln 2,\tag{1}$$ since $\ln\frac1{1-x}&gt;x$ for $1&gt;x&gt;0.$<br>
The lower bound for $x_n$ is somewhat more technical:<br>
We have $$1-\frac{k}{2n+1}=\frac1{1+\frac{k}{2n+1-k}}\ge\left(\frac1{1+\frac{1}{2n+1-k}}\right)^k\ge\left(\frac1{1+\frac{1}{2n+1-\sqrt{n}}}\right)^k$$ for $k\le\sqrt{n}.$ Setting $$\mu_n=\left(\frac1{1+\frac{1}{2n+1-\sqrt{n}}}\right)^{x_n},$$ we obtain the estimate
$$1\ge\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor}\left(1-\frac{k}{2n+1}\right)^{x_n}\ge\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor}(\mu_n)^k=\frac{\mu_n}{1-\mu_n}\left(1-(\mu_n)^{\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor}\right).$$ Clearly, this means $\mu_n\le1/(2-\epsilon_n),$ where $\epsilon_n=O(c^\sqrt{n})$ with some $c&lt;1.$ This means $$x_n\ge\frac{\ln(2-\epsilon_n)}{\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{2n+1-\sqrt{n}}\right)}&gt;(2n+1-\sqrt{n})\ln(2-\epsilon_n),\tag{2}$$ since $\ln(1+x)&lt;x$ for $x&gt;-1.$<br>
(1) and (2) together imply $$\left(2+\frac1n-\frac1{\sqrt{n}}\right)\ln(2-\epsilon_n)&lt;\frac{x_n}{n}&lt;\left(2+\frac1n\right)\ln2,$$ and thus, $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x_n}{n}=2\ln2.$$<br>
In the case of the equation $$\sum_{i=0}^n (n+i)^{x_n}=(2n+2)^{x_n},$$ we get
$$\sum_{k=2}^{n+2}\left(1-\frac{k}{2n+2}\right)^{x_n}=1,$$ so the equation for $\lambda=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\lambda_n$ becomes not $\lambda/(1-\lambda)=1,$ but $\lambda^2/(1-\lambda)=1,$ i.e. $\lambda=1/\phi.$</p>

"2378641","2378661","<p>In reference to your first point, by Fourier Law the heat flux $q$ is proportional to the temperature gradient.

$$ \lvert F \rvert = - k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = - k\, (-\frac{1}{2}) (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{-3/2} 2 x $$

"
"2378642","2378988","<p>The expression they provide is just a useful measure, but it is not exact. </p>

<p>Let me first recast the problem in a simpler form, maybe easier to handle. The helical geometry is not essential, as the only relevant value is the radius $r$.
So one can translate everything to the plane. </p>

<p>Given a continuous function $f(x)$ such that it is different from zero only on a certain interval, without loss of generality $[-\frac{L}{2};\frac{L}{2}]$, we can ask the question of looking for a quantity that could give us an approximation of the said interval length. </p>

<p>This is analogous to what they do in the paper you cite: they deal with “localised” helices, such that $r$ is different from $0$ only over an interval (this explains their comment on why the expression they mention is rather insensitive to integration limits).</p>

<p>So, looking for such quantity, first of all we would like it to be dimensionally right: and the expression you quote has the dimension of length (the denominator has dimension $L^6$ and the denominator $L^5$), so we indeed get a length out of it, dimensionally speaking. </p>

<p>Further, we can check how the provided expression works for “box” type functions, zero outside an interval (of length, say, $L$) and equal to a constant, which we call $a$, inside it.
Then, the expression you quote simplifies to $$ \frac{(L a^2)^2}{L a^4} = \frac{L^2 a^4}{L a^4} = L $$ as desired.</p>

<p>For a general function $f$, one can use the mean value theorem, and say
$$ \frac{(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f^2(x) \mathrm{d}x)^2} {\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f^4(x)\mathrm{d}x} =
\frac{(\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} f^2(x) \mathrm{d}x)^2} {\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} f^4(x)\mathrm{d}x} =
\frac{(L f^2(\xi_1))^2}{L f^4(\xi_2)} = L \frac{f^4(\xi_1)}{f^4(\xi_2)}
$$ 
And it all boils down to the fact $\xi_1$ and $\xi_2$ are “close”.</p>

<p>We can further check that the answer is not exact for less simple functions: one can try functions such as $ f(x) =\beta \sqrt{cos(x)}$ defined on $[-\pi/2;\pi/2]$ and zero everywhere else, or $ f(x) = \beta \sqrt{1-x^2}$ defined on $[-1;1]$ and zero everywhere else , and verify that the answer is only an approximation, albeit very useful. </p>

"2378662","2378793","<p>Let $n=2m-1$ be odd. The simple function

$$f_{2m-1}(x)=\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \phi(x+2j)$$
the function $f_{2m-1}$ is a sum of $m$ copies of $\phi$ translated to the left by amounts $2j\geq0$ $(0\leq j\leq m-1)$. It therefore has $m$ such descending ramps, the leftmost beginning at $-1-2(m-1)=-(2m-1)$. It follows that $f_{2m-1}$ is monotonically decreasing and takes its minimum $-m$ in all points $x\geq0$.</p>

<p>Now 
$$f_{2m}(x)=f_{2m-1}(x)+|x+2m|\ .$$

In the interval $[{-2m},0]$ this steady increase of $x\mapsto |x+2m|$ interferes with the cascade of ramps of $f_{2m-1}$, resulting in a horizontal zigzag of period $2$ and amplitude $1$. At $x=0$ we are at the lower end of the last ramp, and from then on $f_{2m}$ will definitely increase with slope $1$. The minimum of $f_{2m}$ can therefore be found by computing $f_{2m}(0)$, and is found to be

"2378687","2379086","<p>Yes, this is correct. Start with an orthonormal moving frame $e_1,\dots,e_n; e_{n+1}$ with $e_{n+1}$ the normal, and let $\omega_i$ be the dual coframe on $M$. If $e_1,e_2$ is an orthonormal basis for $\Sigma$ and $\Omega_{ij}$ is the curvature $2$-form, we have
$$K(\Sigma) = -\Omega_{12}(e_1,e_2).$$
By the Gauss equation, we also have
$$\Omega_{12} = -\sum_{i,j=1}^n h_{1i} h_{2j} \omega_i\wedge\omega_j,$$

In particular, we see that $K(\Sigma) = h_{11}h_{22}-h_{12}h_{21}$, and this is precisely the determinant of $s|_\Sigma$ in the event that $s(\Sigma)\subset\Sigma$. (After all, the matrix of $s_p$ with respect to the basis $e_1,\dots,e_n$ is precisely $(h_{ij})$.)</p>

Thus you are in the hypothesis of Euler's Theorem: $x$ and $18$ are coprime and so

<blockquote>
  <p>A <strong>better answer</strong> to your misgivings (in the sense of being closer to the mainstream presentation) is probably simply to jump in with both feet and declare that <strong>a line is not really made of points</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Decide to think of a line as <em>something that is in principle a different kind of thing from a bunch of points glued together</em>. You can do this and still acknowledge that points <em>exist</em> and some of them are on the line while others are not.</p>
  
  <p>It then turns out that all of the properties of a line segment (or a smooth curve in general) can be <em>recovered</em> from knowing which points lie on it and which don't. This doesn't necessarily mean that the points <em>make up</em> the line, but merely that the points tell us <em>enough</em> about the line.</p>
  
  <p>It is <em>technically convenient</em>, then, to speak about the <em>set of points on the line</em> as a placeholder for the line itself, when we're formalizing our reasoning -- for the pragmatic reason that we have a well-developed common machinery and notation for speaking of sets of things, which means that we don't need to introduce a new formalism for an entirely different kind of things.</p>
  
  <p>Some people are so comfortable with this representation that they happily declare that the line IS its set of points -- but nobody says you have to think of it that way. As long as you agree that the set of points <em>determine</em> the line, you can still communicate with people who prefer the other idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would one want to do that, you ask?</p>

<p>One reason is if it happens to be more comfortable philosophically to think that way. It's up to you whether it is or not, of course -- but, for example, the asker I wrote the above text had gotten himself into conceptual trouble trying to imagine how points can have zero length and width, and yet still combine to form a line of nonzero length.</p>

<p>Another reason is that you can <em>avoid talking about sets</em> at all for some purposes. Mathematicians use sets all the time, of course, but set theory does come at a foundational cost. For example, you can't have a <em>formal theory</em> that admits sets in a useful way without Gödel's incompleteness theorem applying, so the theory would necessarily be incomplete.</p>

<p>In particular, plain old <em>Euclidean geometry</em> can be formalized without having any concept of a set of points. That's what Euclid was doing, of course, though he missed a number of ""intuitive"" continuity properties. Hilbert tried to repair that, now explicitly considering ""line"" to be a primitive concept, but he failed to make it completely formal because formal logic was still being invented. (Later Tarski constructed an actual complete first-order theory of geometry, but he did it by omitting <em>any</em> concept of ""line"" at all, speaking instead of ""collinear"" as a relation between three points).</p>

<p>Suppose otherwise then $m\{f&gt;0\}&gt;0\ or\ m\{f&lt;0\}&gt;0$. Without loss of generality, we assume $m\{f&gt;0\}&gt;0$. Since $\{f&gt;0\}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\{f\geq1/n\}$, and due to continuity of measurement and integrality of the function we have
$$\exists n_0\in\mathbb{N}\quad s.t.\quad 0&lt;m\{f\geq1/n_0\}&lt;\infty$$
For the measurablity of $\{f\geq1/n_0\},\exists\ an\ open\ set\ sequence\ \{G'_n\}_n\ $ such that</p>

Let $G_n=\bigcap_{k=1}^nG'_k$. Then we get a open set sequence $\{G_n\}$ monotonically decresing to $\{G_\delta\}$. Then $\lim_{n\to\infty}m(G_n-G)=0.$</p>

<p>Because of the uniform continuity of integrals, there is a real number $\delta&gt;0$ such that for all measurable set $A$ satisfies $m(A)&lt;\delta$ we have $|\int_Afdx|&lt;\frac{m(G)}{2n_0}(&gt;0)$.</p>

<p>Since $\lim_{n\to\infty}m(G_n-G)=0$, there is a $N$ such that $m(G_N-G)&lt;\delta$.</p>

<p>$G_N$ is open, so it can be expressed as a countable union of open intervals, then $$\int_{G_N} fdx=0$$</p>

"2378838","2378895","<p>For the first function observe that it is a composition of $(x-1)^2$ and $e^x$ and since both are continuous and moreover, they are differentiable on $\Bbb R$, the composition i.e. $e^{(x-1)^2}$ is differentiable over $\Bbb R$. </p>

<p>So differentiating, $f^/(x) = 2(x-1)e^{(x-1)^2}$ and $$ f^{(2)}(x) = {4(x-1)^2}e^{(x-1)^2} + 2e^{(x-1)^2}$$.</p>

<p>Now equating, $f^/(x) = 0 $ we obtain that x = 1.</p>

<p>Putting x = 1 at  $ f^{(2)}(x) = {4(x-1)^2}e^{(x-1)^2} + 2e^{(x-1)^2}$ we deduce that $f^{(2)}(x) &gt; 0$, so f has a global minima at x = 1 . At that point , f(1) = 1.</p>

<p>So at all other points $f(x)&gt;1$ and since $f$ is continous on a connected interval, it satisfies the IVP and thus answer to your first question becomes $[1,+\infty)$ .</p>

<p>[Actually, you can consider the graph of $e^{(x-1)^2}$ to be that of $e^{x^2}$ with the origin right-shifted at x = 1.]</p>

"2378903","2379206","<p>It's hard to answer such questions when we aren't given any context.  I have several answers in mind, but they each depend on what you already know.  Just taking a stab:  The function $m=-r(r-4)= -r^2+4r$ is quadratic and its graph is a parabola.  Since the leading coefficient is negative, we know it's parabola with arms pointing down.  So the maximum of the function is at the vertex of the parabola.  The usual way to find the vertex is by completing the square, as was done in your example.  </p>

<p>Other ways are by taking the derivative $\frac{dm}{dr} = -2r+4$ and setting it equal to zero.  When you solve, you get $r=2$, which you can plug back into the function to get $m=4.$</p>

"2378912","2378924","<p>The gradient of the surface is given by $\nabla = \langle -e^{-x}siny, e^{-x}cosy \rangle $. Evaluating this gradient at $x = 0, y = \frac{\pi}{2}$, you find $\langle (-e^{0})sin(\frac{\pi}{2}), e^{0}cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) \rangle = \langle -1, 0 \rangle$. Therefore the slope of $x = -1, y = 0$. The value of $z$ at this surface is $1$ so you get $z = -x + 1$ or $z + x = 1$ as your tangent plane. </p>
"
"2378918","2379124","<p>Let's define the following: $$ d_N = \det\left(\prod_{k=1}^N A(k)\right) = \prod_{k=1}^N \det(A(k))=\prod_{k=1}^N a_{11}(k)a_{22}(k)-a_{21}(k)a_{12}(k) $$ where $a_{ij}(k)\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$.
So then the expected value is given by: $$ \mathbb{E}[d_N]=0=:\mu_N $$
Next, define $$ \hat{S}_1(k) = \hat{a}_{11}(k)\hat{a}_{22}(k),\;\;\hat{S}_2(k) = \hat{a}_{21}(k)\hat{a}_{21}(k) $$
where $\hat{a}_{ij}(k)\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.
So, the variance is written: 
\begin{align} 
\mathbb{V}[d_N] &amp;= \mathbb{E}[d_N^2]= \mathbb{E}\left[ \prod_{k=1}^N (a_{11}(k)a_{22}(k)-a_{21}(k)a_{12}(k))^2 \right]\\
&amp;=\prod_{k=1}^N \mathbb{E}\left[ (a_{11}(k)a_{22}(k)-a_{21}(k)a_{12}(k))^2 \right]\\
&amp;= \prod_{k=1}^N \mathbb{E}\left[ (\sigma^2\hat{S}_1(k)-\sigma^2\hat{S}_1(k))^2 \right]\\ &amp;= \sigma^{4N}\prod_{k=1}^N \mathbb{E}\left[ (\hat{S}_1(k)-\hat{S}_1(k))^2 \right]
\end{align}
Now for some random variable algebra. First, note that the $\hat{S}_i$ are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">chi-squared</a> because they are a product of independent normal RVs (e.g. <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/161757/what-is-the-distribution-of-a-random-variable-that-is-the-product-of-the-two-nor?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1"">here</a>): $$ \hat{S}_1(k), \hat{S}_2(k)\sim\chi^2_1 $$<br>
Next, define $\mathfrak{D}_k= \hat{S}_1(k) - \hat{S}_2(k)$. The difference between two chi-squared variables (e.g. <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/85249/distribution-of-difference-of-chi-squared-variables"">here</a>, or <a href=""http://www.math.kit.edu/stoch/~klar/seite/veroeffentlichungen/media/note-vg-revision.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>A note on gamma difference distributions</em> by

$$ \mathfrak{D}_k\sim\Gamma_\mathcal{V}(\mu,\alpha,\beta,\lambda,\gamma)=\Gamma_\mathcal{V}\left(0,\frac{1}{2},0,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right) $$
This also tells us that:
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[\mathfrak{D}_k] &amp;= \mu + \frac{2\beta\lambda}{\gamma^2} = 0 \\ 
\mathbb{V}[\mathfrak{D}_k] &amp;= \frac{2\lambda}{\gamma^2}\left( 1 + \frac{2\beta^2}{\gamma^2} \right) = 4
\end{align}
So now we can complete the computation:
$$
\mathbb{V}[d_N]=\sigma^{4N}\prod_{k=1}^N \mathbb{E}\left[ \mathfrak{D}_k^2 \right]
= \sigma^{4N}\prod_{k=1}^N (\mathbb{V}[\mathfrak{D}_k] + \mathbb{E}[\mathfrak{D}_k]^2) = 4^N\sigma^{4N} =: \varsigma^2_N

"2379102","2379120","<p>Firstly, the operations of addition and multiplication are just binary operators, that is an operator say, $\#$, that works on any two elements out of a mathematical <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">set</a>, $S$. </p>

<p>We can say that those two elements $a,b \in S$, are in the set and can be operated on $a\; \# \;b$ to get another $c \in S$. This property, of taking a binary operation on two elements of a set to get another element of a set is the fundamental axiom of what we call a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""> group</a>. There are infact other properties that $\#$ must have to qualify for a group, notably there must be some $e \in S$ that $a\; \# \;e = e \; \# \; a = a$, and inverses that exist. However, you can look into that more on your own.</p>

<p>Back to your original question, addition and multiplication as you describe them, are simple two binary operations that have come to mean a whole lot to the world as a whole as they generally do a  good job at combining numbers we observe in every day life.</p>

<p>The property you describe as ""ease"" of multiplication I assume is in large part due to its distributivity, as both multiplication and addition are communities (the order of the elements being operated on does not matter) and associate (the order of successive calls of the operator does not matter). Which I should note, these properties, especially commutativity are rare and special to come by!</p>

<p>As multiplication is in fact a shorthand to express addition, distributivity can be ""proved"" as follows:</p>

<p>$$(a+b)*(c) = \sum^{c}_{1}{a+b} = \sum^{c}_{1}{a} + \sum^{c}_{1}{c} = a*c + b*c. $$</p>

<p>This property is in large part why it is so much easier to deal with values as you describe in physics, where simplification in large part is due to the grouping and solving of sub expressions that can be most readily extracted out using distributivity. </p>

<p>I also suggest you ponder over further opertators that are extensions atop multiplication themselves!

<hr>

<p>Your mistake starts at 5, but it's so far a misunderstanding of $O(\cdot)$ vs. $o(\cdot)$. Note that $\ln(1+u) = u+o(u)$ (<em>little</em> $o(\cdot)$, not ""big"" $O(\cdot)$: they have different meanings!).</p>

<p>Now, your <em>actual</em> mistake is at 6, when you replace $(1-t)^{2-t}$ by $1$. <em>You cannot do that</em>: the low-order terms of this quantity <strong>will</strong> matter, as we will see below. More generally, when confronted to something like that, I encourage you to rewrite it in the <em>exponential form</em>
$$
(1-t)^{2-t} = e^{(2-t)\ln(1-t)}
$$
and then apply the Taylor expansions of $\ln(1+u)$ and $e^u$ around $0$, in that order. (Doing so, and we will do so below, you would get $(1-t)^{2-t} = 1-2t + o(t)$, and the second term will be important: this basically changes a term $(1-t+o(t))$ to $(1-2t)(1-t+o(t)))= 1-3t+o(t).$</p>

<p>Let us focus on the first term, call it $A$, since the limit $e$ for the second was correct.
$$\begin{align}
A &amp;= \frac{(1+(-t))^{2-t}(\ln(1-t)+1)-1+t}{t} \\

"2379182","2379218","<p>A <em>necessary</em> condition is that the number of island-bridge incidences (or bridge-ends) is even (as it is twice the total number of bridges). As $1^2+2^2+\ldots+n^2=\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$, this means that $n\equiv 0\pmod 4$ or $n\equiv 3\pmod 4$.
Also, it is necessary that $n^2\le 1^2+2^2+\ldots+(n-1)^2$ or else we're forced to have some bridge on island $n$ loop back to the same island.
This condition is equivalent to $n^2\le \frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}6$, i.e.,  $6n\le (n-1)(2n-1)$, or: $n\ge 5$.</p>

<p>These conditions are also <em>sufficient:</em> Suppose that $n\ge 5$ and $n\equiv 0$ or $\equiv 3\pmod 4$.
Then we can assign $1^2+2^2+\ldots+n^2$ bridge-ends to the islands such that the $i$th island obtains $i^2$ bridge-ends.
Our task is to match bridge-ends in pairs to form bridges.
It is straightforward to first join island $i$ with $i+1$ in order to ensure that we have connectivity as required (this uses one bridge-end for $i=1$ and for $i=n$, and two bridge-ends for all other $i$). Among all pairings among the remaining bridge-ends, pick one that minimizes the number $\ell$ of loops (i.e., bridges running from an island to itself). Assume $\ell&gt;0$.
Let island $a$ have a loop between bridge-ends $u$ and $v$.
As the remaining at most $n^2-2$ bridge-ends on island $a$ cannot use up the at least $1^2+2^2+\ldots+(n-1)^2$ bridge-ends on the other islands, there exists a bridge between an end $x$ on an island $b\ne a$ and an end $y$ on island $c\ne a$ (whereas we do allow $b=c$).
Then we remove bridges $uv$ and $xy$ and replace them with $ux$ and $vy$. Note that this does not destroy connectivity (we can walk from $b$ to $c$ via $a$) and we end up with at most $\ell-1$ loops, contradicting minimality of $\ell$.
We conclude that either $\ell=0$, as desired.</p>

"2379185","2379202","<p>Let $R$ be any ring. Then $R[[X]]$ denotes the ring of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_ower_series"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">formal power series</a> over $R$.</p>

<p>Informally, one often simply <em>defines</em> it as the set
$$\Big\{\sum_{n=0}^∞a_nX^n;~a_n ∈ R~\text{for all}~n∈ℕ_0\Big\},$$
and then proceeds to say “Its elements are <em>formal expressions</em>” (without clarifying what formal expressions are) and “This yields a ring when equipped with the suggestive addition and multiplication on it.” One then calls “$X$” a <em>formal variable</em> and leaves it undefined and uninterpreted.</p>

<p>To the formalist, this is of course extremely unsatisfactory. But fortunately, the wikipedia article above gives a formal definition of it <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_power_series#Ring_structure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Following this definition, “$\sum_{n=0}^∞ a_nX^n$” simply becomes a suggestive notation for the sequence $(a_n)_{n ∈ ℕ_0}$. Again, this might be unsatisfactory. <em>However</em>, if you define $X$ to be the special sequence
$$X = (0,1,0,…),$$
this notation actually makes sense: One may interpret $R[[X]]$ as <em>topological</em> ring which is <em>complete</em> in a certain sense and then the formal series literally becomes
$$\sum_{n=0}^∞a_nX^n = \lim_{N→∞} \sum_{n=0}^N a_nX^n.$$
If you are interested in this viewpoint, I suggest you first read wikipedial on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_ring"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">topological rings</a>, specifically the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_ring#Examples"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">examples</a> section, discussing the $I$-adic topology.

<p>By the way, this trick also works for polynomial rings $R[X]$ (with which I presume you are at least somewhat/intuitively familiar), defining $R[X]$ as a set of sequences in $R$ and $X = (0,1,0,…)$: You just have to restrict yourself to sequences that are nonzero only at finitely many terms. But then, the polynomial $\sum_{n=0}^N a_nX^n$ too really <em>is</em> the sum of monomials $a_nX^n$ and $X^n$ really <em>is</em> the product of some special element $X = (0,1,0,…)$ by itself.</p>

<p>To prove that this is the only solution, note that for $$P^*(x, y, z) := P(x+y+z)-P(x)-P(y)-P(z)$$ $P^*(x, y, z)$ must be in the ideal generated by $xy+yz+zx-1$ in $\mathbb{C}[x, y, z]$ as this polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb{C}$. Therefore, $$P^*(x, y, z) = Q(x, y, z)(xy+yz+zx-1)$$ for some polynomial $Q$. Note that $P^*(x, y, z)$ and  $xy+yz+zx-1$ are both symmetric polynomials. In particular, $xy+yz+zx-1 = \frac{1}{2}p_1^2-\frac{1}{2}p_2-1$, where $p_k := x^k+y^k+z^k$. Now, note that for $P(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_kx^k$, $$P^*(x, y, z) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k(p_1^k-p_k)$$ As $Q(x, y, z)$ is the quotient of symmetric polynomials, it must also be a symmetric polynomial. Thus, we write $R^*(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n)$ and $R(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n)$ to be the polynomial representations of $P^*$ and $Q$ respectively in terms of power sums (which are algebraically independent). After switching to $R$ and $R^*$, our equation in $P^*$ and $Q$ becomes $$R^*(p_1, \ldots, p_n) = \left(\frac{1}{2}p_1^2-\frac{1}{2}p_2-1\right)R(p_1, \ldots, p_n)$$ If $a_n\neq 0$ for some $n\geq 3$, then $R^*(p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ will have a nonzero term $-a_np_n$. However, this term cannot appear on the right-hand side, as if $R$ has a term $a_np_n$, then it would imply that $R^*$ also has terms $-\frac{a_n}{2}p_1^2p_n$ and $-\frac{a_n}{2}p_2p_n$ (which do not appear in the above sum). Thus, $R^*$ must equal $-2a_0+a_2(p_1^2-p_2)$, which implies that $\deg(R) = \deg(R^*)-2 = 0$. Then, $R\equiv c$ for some constant $c$, and $a_0 = a_2 = \frac{c}{2}$.

<p>You can see where this is headed. Nature is full of complex processes. How tall are you? Well, it depends on genetics, nutrition, exercise, injuries, bone loss, and so many more things. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem"" rel=""noreferrer"">central limit theorem</a> shows (see <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2379271/why-do-bell-curves-appear-everywhere/2379472#comment4906601_2379472"">symplectomorphic's comment</a> below) that when adding the sum of a large number of things together, the resulting distribution is not just any bell-looking curve, but specifically the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"" rel=""noreferrer"">normal distribution</a>. Or for things with multiplicative combination, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution"" rel=""noreferrer"">log-normal distribution</a>.</p>

<p>Why does this happen? <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2379288/139015"">mathreadler's answer</a> hints it has to do with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution"" rel=""noreferrer"">convolving</a> distributions. The probability density function of a single die is a rectangular function (technically discrete, but let's pretend it's continuous). The sum of two rolls together is then the convolution of two rectangular functions.</p>

<p>Notice how the result (the black triangle) looks like the case of two dice above. If then convolve this triangle with another rectangle, you get three dice. The more times you do this, the closer the result gets to a normal distribution.</p>

<p>The probability density function of the normal distribution is a Gaussian function, which have some elegant properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Gaussian convolved with a Gaussian is another Gaussian.</li>
<li>The product of two Gaussians is a Gaussian.</li>
<li>The Fourier transform of a Gaussian is a Gaussian.</li>
</ul>

<p>From this you might intuitively see as things converge towards normal distributions, they ""want"" to stay as normal distributions since their ""Gaussianess"" is preserved under many operations.</p>

<p>Of course not everything is so simple as a single die roll, nor as complex as the determination of the height of a human. So there are a large number of distributions that look like a bell, but on careful examination aren't the normal distribution. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"" rel=""noreferrer"">Some of them exist in nature</a>, and some find application as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution"" rel=""noreferrer"">mathematical tools for some purpose</a>. Looking through  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia's list of probability distributions</a> you can see bell-like shapes are quite common, even if they aren't exactly the normal distribution.</p>

<p>But if you combine these two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The central limit theorem means the normal distribution is common, and</li>
<li>many distributions look like bells but aren't the normal distribution,</li>
</ul>

<p>you might conclude <em>most probability graphs show a bell curve</em>.</p>

"2379276","2379297","<p>Yes, in general the proof is correct, but you need to be a bit more specific regarding your choice of $p_1$, $p_2$ in the first part of the proof. Simply requiring that $p_1(1),p_1(2),p_2(1),p_2(2) \neq 0$ is not sufficient, because they could have opposite signs and the terms would cancel. You can however require $$p_1(1)=p_1(2)=p_2(1)=p_2(2)=1\,,$$ which would be sufficient. Similarly, for the $\sin p(0)$ term, consider polynomials with 
$$p_1(0) = p_2(0) = \frac \pi 2\,.$$
Otherwise your reasoning is correct.</p>
"
"2379309","2379592","<p>As Rob Arthan stated, you are correct that the grammars provided do not accurately and precisely capture the concrete syntax of the lambda calculus. That's because they are not intended to. A statement like $\Lambda ::= V \mid (\Lambda \Lambda) \mid (\lambda V.\Lambda)$ is intended to be a declaration of <em>abstract</em> syntax.  It is very much akin to a <code>data</code> declaration in a language like Haskell, ML, or Agda.  For example, in Haskell syntax it might look like: <code>data Exp = Var V | Abs Exp Exp | Lam V Exp</code>. Many tools that are closer to specification than programming such as Agda, Coq, or the $\mathbb{K}$ Framework allow much more syntactic flexibility for a comparable investment of effort. For example, in the <a href=""http://www.kframework.org/index.php/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">$\mathbb{K}$ Framework</a> the following declaration captures some of the common conventions for lambda notation and produces a working parser:</p>

<pre><code>syntax L ::= Id
           | L L          [left]
           | ""("" L "")""    [bracket]
           &gt; ""λ"" Id ""."" L
</code></pre>

<p>This correctly parses ""λx.λy.x y y"" and further produces the exact same AST for ""λx.λy.((x y y))"". My point with this is most work indicates the abstract syntax as that's what a semantics operates over. Obviously, at the end of the day they have to use some concrete syntax even to write down the abstract syntax. The precise details are rarely spelled out in anything other than descriptions of machine implementations. The details are usually tedious, unimportant, and, as the above demonstrates, largely mechanically derivable given a bit of additional information beyond the context-free grammar. Nevertheless, for me ""formal"" = ""machine-checked""; everything else is informal no matter how detailed. In that vein, here's a complete executable formalization of beta reduction in $\mathbb{K}$:</p>

<pre><code>require ""substitution.k""
module LAM
    imports SUBSTITUTION
    syntax L ::= Id
               | L L          [left]
               | ""("" L "")""    [bracket]
               &gt; ""^"" Id ""."" L [binder]

    syntax KVariable ::= Id

    rule (^ X:Id . M:L) N:L =&gt; M[N / X] [anywhere]
endmodule
</code></pre>

<p>where I've replaced λ with ^ because while the generated parser doesn't have an issue with the Unicode, the rewrite engine does. This correctly reduces ""^y.(^x.^y.x y)y"" to ""^ y . ^ _1 . y _1"" where the inner ""y"" has been alpha-renamed to ""_1"". Of course, all the real work of this definition has been hidden away in the predefined SUBSTITUTION module. At any rate, as the tooling advances, there's less and less reason not to formalize these sorts of things in my sense of ""formalize"".</p>

"2379315","2379409","<p>You can try to prove that the closed interval and the circle are not homeomorphic. (The analogous problem for higher dimensions requires some algebraic topology.)</p>

<p>With the same idea, prove that the line is not homeomorphic to the plane.</p>

"
"2379316","2379324","<p>There is still such a surjection: send $r$ to the countable ordinal it codes if it codes a countable ordinal, and to (say) $17$ otherwise.</p>

<hr>

<p>Specifically, we can assign (exercise) a relation $R_r$ on $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ to each real $r$, in such a way that every binary relation on $\mathbb{N}$ winds up being of the form $R_r$ for at least one $r$. Now say $r$ codes a countable ordinal $\alpha$ if $(\mathbb{N},R_r)$ is a well-ordering of type $\alpha$. </p>

<hr>

<p>A more computability-theoretic approach: to each real $r$, assign its relative Church-Kleene ordinal $\omega_1^{CK}(r)$ (this is the least ordinal with no copy computable from $r$). The set $\{\omega_1^{CK}(r): r\in\mathbb{R}\}$ is cofinal in $\omega_1$ (exercise - this is basically the previous paragraph!), and so we can ""collapse"" it to get a surjection $\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\omega_1$. By ""collapse,"" I mean the following: for a set $S$ of ordinals, map $x\in S$ to the ordertype of $(\{y\in S: y\in x\}, \in)$. The image of $S$ under this map is an ordinal (exercise), and if $S$ is a cofinal subset of $\omega_1$ the image is in fact $\omega_1$ (exercise).</p>

<p><em>Interestingly, we don't need the regularity of $\omega_1$ to do this second exercise - which is good, since $\omega_1$ need not be regular in ZF alone!</em></p>

<p>Let's compute the Jacobian determinant of your functions.</p>

<p>First, we need all the partial derivatives:
\begin{align*}
\pd{f_1}{x} &amp; = y \\
\pd{f_1}{y} &amp; = x \\
\pd{f_2}{x} &amp; = x \\
\pd{f_2}{y} &amp; = -y
\end{align*}
Now, we arrange them into the jacobian matrix:
$$J = \begin{pmatrix}y &amp; x \\ x &amp; -y\end{pmatrix}$$
Now, we compute the 'area element', which is $|\det(J)|$:
$$|\det J| = |(-y^2-x^2)| = x^2+y^2$$</p>

<p>I suspect you left off the absolute value.  Remember the Jacobian determinant is the <em>magnitude</em> of the determinant of the jacobian.</p>
"
"2379339","2379431","<p>Here is literally what you have to do.</p>

<p>(1) Simplify by noting that the absolute of some of the terms are unity,</p>

\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>(2) expand and collect the real and imaginary parts</p>

<p>$$
\begin{align}
\left\lvert (a+ib)^2 e^{ia+b}-(a-ib)^2 e^{ia-b}\right\rvert ^2
&amp;=\left\lvert (a^2-b^2) (e^{b}-e^{-b})+2abi(e^{b}+e^{-b}) \right\rvert ^2\\
&amp;=\left\lvert (a^2-b^2) 2\sinh b+2abi 2\cosh b \right\rvert ^2\\
&amp;=\sqrt{((a^2-b^2) 2\sinh b)^2+(2ab 2\cosh b)^2}^2\\
&amp;=(a^2-b^2)^2 4\sinh^2 b+16a^2b^2\cosh^2 b

<p>For fixed $Z$, this is a Pell equation.  If $\pmatrix{X\cr Y}$ is a solution, then so is $\pmatrix{3 &amp; 4\cr 2 &amp; 3\cr}^k \pmatrix{X \cr Y}$ for any $k$ (with the same $Z$).  If $k$ is divisible by $12$, this will be the same mod $18$ as $\pmatrix{X\cr Y}$.  Thus we will get infinite families of solutions.</p>

"2379356","2379373","<p>As Alex notes, we can neglect the $x+$ part of the function, and simply show that $g(x,y)=\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}}$ is continuous (if you are uneasy about this, tell me and I'll say more).  </p>

<p>I think the sensible thing to do here is interpret $g$ geometrically. Away from the origin (which is precisely the condition you insist on), $g(x,y)$ may be geometrically interpreted as $\cos \theta$, with $\theta$ the angle between $(x,y)$ and the $x$-axis.   </p>

<p>Let $(u,v)$ be an arbitrary point with $0&lt;\sqrt{u^{2}+v^{2}}\le 1$, and let $\varepsilon&gt;0$.

By continuity of $\cos$, this is the same as making $|\theta_{x}-\theta_{u}|$ appropriately small (I'm being intentionally vague as you only asked for a hint; I hope this doesn't make it more confusing).  </p>

"2379383","2379404","<p>It's always possible.</p>

<p>You want to multiply top and bottom by $M$ to get that $denominator*M$ has not radical.</p>

<p>As you have figured out:  If the denominator is $a + b\sqrt{c}$ you mulitply by the conjugate to get $(a + b\sqrt{c})(a - b\sqrt{c}) = a^2 - b^2*c$.</p>

<p>This will also work with $(\sqrt a + \sqrt b)(\sqrt a - \sqrt b) = a - b$.</p>

<p>So it's the same idea for $a + \sqrt[k] b$.  The trick is to realize that $(a + \sqrt[k]b)(a^{k-1} - a^{k-2}\sqrt[k]b + a^{k-3}(\sqrt[k]b)^2-..... \pm a(\sqrt[k]b)^{k-2} \mp (\sqrt[k]b)^{k-1} = a^k \pm b$.</p>

<p>Example:  To deradicalize $5 + \sqrt[3]7$ multiply by $5^2 - 5*\sqrt[3]7 + (\sqrt[3]7)^2$ to get $(5 + \sqrt[3]7)(5^2 - 5*\sqrt[3]7 + (\sqrt[3]7)^2) = 5^3 + 5^2\sqrt[3]7 -5^2\sqrt[3]7 - 5*(\sqrt[3]7)^2 + 5*(\sqrt[3]7)^2 + (\sqrt[3]7)^3 = 125 + 7$.</p>

<p>So to deradicalize $(2 + \sqrt 2 + \sqrt[3] 2)$ just deradicalize it term by term.</p>

<p>First let's get rid of the $\sqrt[3]2$ term.  So we multiply top and bottom by $(2+\sqrt 2)^2 - (2 +\sqrt 2)*\sqrt[3]2 + (\sqrt[3]2)^2$ to get $(2 + \sqrt 2 + \sqrt[3] 2)*[(2+\sqrt 2)^2 - (2 +\sqrt 2)*\sqrt[3]2 + (\sqrt[3]2)^2] = (2 + \sqrt 2)^3 + 2= 8 + 12 \sqrt 2 + 12\sqrt 2 + 2\sqrt 2 + 2 = 10 + 26\sqrt 2$.  Then we multiply that by $10  - 26 \sqrt 2$ to get $(10 + 26\sqrt 2)(10 - 26\sqrt 2) = 100 - 2*26^2$.</p>

<p>So example:</p>

<p>\begin{align} &amp;\frac 1 {2 + \sqrt 2 + \sqrt[3] 2} \\&amp;= 
\frac {(2 + \sqrt 2)^2 - (2+\sqrt2)\sqrt[3]2 + \sqrt[3]2^2}{(2+\sqrt 2)^3 + 2}\\&amp;=
\frac {(4 + 4\sqrt 2 + 2) -2\sqrt[3] 2 - \sqrt 2\sqrt[3]2 + \sqrt[3]2^2}{10 + 26\sqrt 2}\\&amp;=
\frac {[(4 + 4\sqrt 2 + 2) -2\sqrt[3] 2 - \sqrt 2\sqrt[3]2 + \sqrt[3]2^2](10 - 26\sqrt{2})}{100 - 2*26^2} \end{align}</p>

<p>Okay... admittedly that is a bear... but it is doable.</p>

"2379439","2379478","<p>The very important topic of Conservation Laws makes great use of the Jacobian matrix. A set of conservation laws in one dimension takes the form of partial differential equations
$$\partial_t\mathbf{u}+\partial_x\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{u})=0$$
where $\mathbf{u}$ is a vector containing the conserved variables. In the canonical example of compressible fluid flow these are mass density, momentum density and energy density. $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{u})$ is another vector that contains, loosely, the rates at which these quantities flow. This is often written as $$\mathbf{u}_t+\mathbf{A}\mathbf{u}_x=0$$
where $\mathbf{A}$ is the Jacobian matric relating changes in $\mathbf{f}$ to changes in $\mathbf{u}$.</p>

<p>The eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ are the speeds with which various waves propagate with or through the flow. The right eigenvectors are the patterns of disturbance carried by a wave, and the left eigenvectors yield quantities that are constant along a wave path.</p>

<p>EDIT </p>

<p>Another very important application is to computational geometry.
Consider a mapping in $R^3$ where an initial point with position vector ${\mathbf x}$ is taken to a point with position vector $\mathbf{X}$. The Jacobian $\mathbf{J}=\frac{\partial {\mathbf X}}{\partial{\mathbf x}}$ is called the distortion gradient tensor. Assume the mapping is smooth enough that small parallelopipeds are taken to small parallelopipeds.

"2379440","2379496","<p>Let $r^2 = \sum x_i^2$.  Then your map $g$ sends $(x_1,..., x_n)$ to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}(x_1,..., x_n)$.</p>

<p>Now, the question is basically: given the (non-linear) system of equations $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-r^2}} x_i = y_i$, can we solve for $x_i$?</p>

<p>Notice first that if we can somehow compute $r^2$ from this system solely in terms of the $y_i$ variables, then we can easily solve for $x_i$:  $x_i = y_i \sqrt{1-r^2}$.</p>

<p>So lets do that.  Square each of the equations, getting $\frac{x_i^2}{1-r^2} = y_i^2,$ and then add them all together.  This gives $\frac{r^2}{1-r^2} = \sum y_i^2$.  Clearing denominators gives $r^2 = \sum y_i^2 - r^2 \sum y_i^2$.  Adding $r^2\sum y_i^2$ to both sides, factoring, and then dividing yields $$r^2 = \frac{\sum y_i^2}{1+\sum y_i^2}$$ and therefore, that $$x_i = y_i \sqrt{1-\frac{\sum y_i^2}{1+\sum y_i^2}}.$$</p>

<p>In other words, I am claiming that $g^{-1}$ maps $(y_1,...,y_n)$ to $\sqrt{1-\frac{\sum y_i^2}{1+\sum y_i^2}}(y_1,...., y_n)$.</p>

<p>Let's check it.  We see that \begin{align*} (g^{-1}\circ g)(x_1,..., x_n) &amp;= g^{-1}\left( \frac{x_1}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}, ..., \frac{x_n}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}\right)\\ &amp;= \sqrt{1-\frac{ \frac{1}{1-r^2}\sum x_i^2}{1+ \frac{1}{1-r^2} \sum x_i^2}}\left(\frac{x_1}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}, ..., \frac{x_n}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}\right).\end{align*}</p>

<p>Focussing on that horrid coefficient and recalling that $r^2 = \sum x_i^2$, we see that it simplifies to $$\sqrt{1 - \frac{\frac{r^2}{1-r^2}}{1+ \frac{r^2}{1-r^2}}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{\frac{r^2}{1-r^2}}{\frac{1}{1-r^2}}} = \sqrt{1-r^2}.$$</p>

<p>Thus, $(g^{-1}\circ g)(x_1,..., x_n) = (x_1,..., x_n)$ as claimed.  You could check that $g\circ g^{-1}$ is the identity as well (but I leave that to you!), but note that you don't need to - From the chain rule, $Jac(g^{-1})Jac(g) = Id$, so your matrix must be invertible.</p>

<p>We know that $|\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt7) : \mathbb{Q}| = 2$ </p>

<p>Now we want to show  $|\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7+\sqrt7}) :  \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt7)| = 2.$
And similarly  $|\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7-\sqrt7}) :  \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt7)| = 2.$</p>

<p>We then can conclude  $|\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7+\sqrt7}) :  \mathbb{Q}| =  |\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7-\sqrt7}) :  \mathbb{Q}| = 4$</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong>: </p>

<p>By the work you've done you should easily see that $p(x) = x^2 +  (-7 +\sqrt7)$ has $\pm \sqrt{7+\sqrt7}$ as roots.  So we let's hope $p(x)$ is irreducible over  $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt7) $.</p>

<p>Suppose it were reducible, meaning $p(x) = (x-a)(x-b) = x^2 -x(a+b) +ab$ with $a,b \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt7)$.</p>

<p>We find that $a+b = 0$ since there is no $x$ coefficient in $x^2 +  (-7 +\sqrt7)$, so $a = -b.$</p>

<p>Now we have $ab = -a^2 =  -7 +\sqrt7$ and since $a \in \mathbb{Q(\sqrt7)}, \ \ a = c +d\sqrt7$ with $ \ c,d \in \mathbb{Q} $ </p>

<p>So $(c+d\sqrt7)^2 = c^2 +7d^2 + 2cd\sqrt7 = 7 - \sqrt7$ which implies</p>

<p>$c^2 + 7d^2 - 7 = -2cd\sqrt7 - \sqrt7 = -\sqrt7(2cd -1)$ and we have that </p>

<p>$$\frac{c^2 +7d^2 -7}{2cd -1} = -\sqrt7$$ 
Now if $2cd - 1 \neq 0$ then the left hand side is in $\mathbb{Q}$ and the right hand side isn't, so that's a contradiction and therefore $x^2 + (\sqrt7 - 7)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q(\sqrt7)}$</p>

<p>Suppose $2cd - 1 = 0$.  Then $c = \frac{1}{2d}$ and our earlier equation reads as $$(\frac{1}{2d} + d\sqrt7)^2 = \frac{1}{4d^2} + \sqrt7 +7d^2 = 7 - \sqrt7$$ so $$\frac{1}{4d^2} +7d^2 - 7 = -2\sqrt7 $$</p>

<p>Again the L.H.S is in $\mathbb{Q}$ and the right hand side isn't, so we've shown that   $x^2 + (\sqrt7 - 7)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q(\sqrt7)}$.</p>

<p>Very similar steps can be taken to show that $(x - (\sqrt{7 - \sqrt7})(x -
 (-\sqrt{7-\sqrt7})$ is irreducible $\mathbb{Q(\sqrt7)}$</p>

<p>So now we have that 
 $|\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7+\sqrt7}) :  \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt7)| = |\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7-\sqrt7}) :  \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt7)| = 2$ </p>

<p>Now if we show that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7+\sqrt7}) / \mathbb{Q(\sqrt7)} \neq  \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7-\sqrt7}) / \mathbb{Q(\sqrt7)}$ we can conclude that $|\mathbb{E}:\mathbb{Q}| = 8$</p>

<p>This can be done without too much trouble by showing that $\sqrt{7 - \sqrt7} \notin \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7+\sqrt7}) / \mathbb{Q\sqrt7)} $</p>

<p>The rest of the details should be filled in without too much trouble.</p>

"2379518","2379600","<p>Your idea to replace $\sin(nx)$ by $e^{inx}$ is good. Now you can write $\sum_{n=0}^\infty n x^n e^{inx} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty n (x e^{ix})^n$ and let $\alpha := x e^{ix}$. Our goal is to compute
$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty n \alpha^n \text{.}$$</p>

$$\begin{align*}

"2379519","2381856","<p>Let $K/F$ be a finite Galois extension, and let $G = \textrm{Gal}(K/F)$.  Let $\alpha \in K$, and let $f$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $F$.  Let $\Phi$ be the set of roots of $f$.  Since $K/F$ is normal, $\Phi$ is contained in $K$.  Since $K/F$ is separable, the roots of $f$ are distinct.  Thus</p>

<p>$$f(x) = \prod\limits_{\beta \in \Phi} (x - \beta)$$</p>

<p>If I understand your question, what you want to know is why the set $\Phi$ is equal to the set $G.\alpha = \{ \sigma(\alpha) : \sigma \in G \}$.</p>

<p>First, $G.\alpha$ is contained in $\Phi$.  This is easy to see, because if $\sigma \in G$, then $\sigma$ fixes the elements of $F$, hence the coefficients of $f$.  </p>

<p>The converse inclusion is more difficult.  You can prove it using the two equivalent definitions of what it means for a field extension to be normal:</p>

<p><strong>Proposition</strong>: Let $E$ be an algebraic extension of a field $F$.  The following are equivalent:</p>

<p>(i): If $a \in E$, then all the roots of the minimal polynomial of $a$ over $F$ are also in $E$.</p>

<p>(ii): If $\Omega$ is a field containing $E$, and $\phi: E \rightarrow \Omega$ is a homomorphism which fixes $F$ (pointwise), then $\phi$ is actually just an automorphism of $E$.</p>

<p>Now let $\beta$ be another root of $f$. We want to show that $\beta = \sigma(\alpha)$ for some $\sigma \in G$.  There is a unique isomorphism of fields $\phi: F(\alpha) \rightarrow F(\beta)$ which fixes $F$ pointwise and sends $\alpha$ to $\beta$.  </p>

<p>Fix an algebraic closure $\overline{F}$ of $F$ containing $E$.  The isomorphism extension theorem (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism_extension_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism_extension_theorem</a>) tells you that $\phi$ extends (in general, nonuniquely!) to homomorphism $\tilde{\phi}$ of $K$ into $\overline{F}$.  This can be proved using Zorn's lemma.  </p>

<p>But since $K/F$ is a normal extension, $\tilde{\phi}$ is just an automorphism of $K$ fixing $F$.  In other words, $\tilde{\phi} \in G$.  And $\tilde{\phi}(\alpha) = \phi(\alpha) = \beta$, as required.</p>

"2379537","2379641","<p>For each $x \in \mathbb{R}$, its irrationality measure $\mu(x)$ is defined as</p>

<p>Let us collect some basic properties of $\mu$:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is clear that $\mu(x) = 1$ if $x$ is rational. On the other hand, if $x$ is irrational, then by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet%27s_approximation_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Dirichlet's approximation theorem</em></a> we have $\mu(x) \geq 2$.</p></li>
<li><p>We have $\mu(x) = \mu(1/x)$. Indeed, it suffices to prove this for irrational $x$. To this end, notice that if $0 &lt; c &lt; \mu(x)$, then there exists $(a_j, b_j) \in \mathbb{Z}^* \times \mathbb{Z}^*$ such that $|b_j| \to \infty$ and that $|x - (a_j/b_j)| \leq |b_j|^{-c}$. In particular, $a_j/b_j \to x$. Then it follows that</p>

<p>$$ \left| \frac{1}{x} - \frac{b_j}{a_j}\right|
= \frac{|b_j/a_j|}{|x|} \left| x - \frac{a_j}{b_j} \right|
\leq \frac{\text{const}}{|b_j|^c}
\leq \frac{\text{const}}{|a_j|^c}
\leq \frac{1}{|a_j|^{c-\epsilon}} $$</p>

<p>if $\epsilon &gt; 0$ and $j$ is sufficiently large. So we have $c-\epsilon \leq \mu(1/x)$ and this is enough to conclude the claim.</p></li>
<li><p>It is well-known that $\mu(\pi) &lt; \infty$.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Using these properties, we find that $\mu(1/\pi) &lt; \infty$. So we can pick $c &gt; \mu(1/\pi)$. Then</p>

<p>$$ |\cos n| = \left|\sin\pi\left(\frac{n}{\pi} - \frac{1}{2} - a \right) \right| $$</p>

<p>for any $a \in \mathbb{Z}$. Pick $a$ such that $\left| \frac{n}{\pi} - \frac{1}{2} - a \right| \leq \frac{1}{2}$. Then using the inequality $|\sin(\pi x)| \geq 2|x|$ for $|x| \leq \frac{1}{2}$, for large $n$ we have</p>

<p>$$ |\cos n| \geq |2n|\left|\frac{1}{\pi} - \frac{2a+1}{2n} \right| \geq |2n|\cdot\frac{1}{|2n|^{c}} = \frac{1}{|2n|^{c-1}}. $$</p>

<p>This shows that $|\tan n| \leq |2n|^{c-1}$ for large $n$ and hence the series converges absolutely by comparison test.</p>

$\quad\{\{4\},\{3,1\},\{1,3\},\{2,2\},\{2,1,1\},\{1,2,1\},\{1,1,2\},\{1,1,1,1\}\}$<br>
For each partition the last group must have a color different from that of step 1. The second last group must have a color different from the last group etc. Hence a given partition yields $(m-1)^q$ cases, where $q$ is a group count. In total we get a factor $S=\sum_q(m-1)^q$.

Because $x$, $y$ and $z$ are integers, $x-z$, $x-y$ and $z-y$ must be integers too, and the only integers possible are $\pm 1$ and $\pm 2$, so $x$, $y$ and $z$ must also be consecutive integers.</p>

For example,
$$

Each binary relation only describes the relation between the two numbers (or what have you) around it.
It does not mean that $a\leq f$ or $a\approx f$ or anything like that.</p>

<p>From the above chain you can conclude, for example, that $a&lt;d$, but you can't compare $c$ and $f$ without more information.

$$

<p>I would argue that two approximations is still usually fine.
The relation ""$\approx$"" is not rigorously defined, and both the question and this answer are outside the realm of fully rigorous mathematics.
It is defined heuristically (we kind of know what it means), and this heuristic meaning has properties.
One of the problematic properties is transitivity.
If stretched too far, it becomes ridiculous: $1.00\approx1.01\approx1.02\approx\cdots\approx1.99\approx2.00$ and so $1\approx2$, and by induction $n\approx m$ for any two integers $n,m$.
However, I don't see an issue in practical calculations as in the question, and I would confidently conclude $g\approx l$ in my second example.
The approximation gets potentially worse when repeated, but just a couple of steps is no big issue in this context.</p>

<p>It is important to tell your students explicitly and repeatedly that
$$
129.87\cdot 6\approx 130 \cdot 6 = 780
$$
means two statements in one: $129.87\cdot 6\approx 130 \cdot 6$ and $130 \cdot 6 = 780$.
My experience suggests that not all students will understand this unless (even if?) told.
It follows from these two statements that $129.87\cdot 6\approx780$, but this is not stated <em>directly</em>.</p>

<p>I would suggest your first option.
But the second option isn't really wrong either; both $130 \cdot 6 = 780$ and $130 \cdot 6 \approx 780$ are true.
But it can be confusing to use ""$\approx$"" when the two things are actually equal.</p>

"2379764","2379798","<p>You may know that (sometimes this is used as definition of $e$) 
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac1n\right)^n=e $$
Taking $k$th powers, $k\in\Bbb N$, we obtain
$$e^k=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac1{n}\right)^{nk}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac k{nk}\right)^{nk}.$$
The latter limit is the limit of a subsequence of $\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac k{n}\right)^{n}$, hence this also converges to $e^k$, once we know it converges at all. In fact, the same method shows that more generally
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac {ak}n\right)^n =\left(\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac {a}n\right)^n\right)^k$$
for $k\in\Bbb N$ and arbitrary $a$ (provided both limits exist).
As a consequence, $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac {a}n\right)^n=e^a\qquad \text{for all }a\in\Bbb Q_{\ge0}.$$
Finally, using $(1-\frac1n)^n(1+\frac1n)^n=(1-\frac1{n^2})^n$, you can show that the same also hods for $a=-1$ and hence also for all $a\in\Bbb Q$.</p>

<p>For the corresponding filed extension, we have $L=k(u_i, v_iv_j)\subset k(u_i,v_j)$. Take one of the $v_i$s, say $v_1$. Then we have both $v_1v_j$ and $v_1^2$ in $L$ and so, $v_j/v_1\in L$. Note that $k(u_i,v_j)=k(u_i, v_1,v_2/v_1,\ldots, v_n/v_1)$ Thus, we see that the fixed field contains all the generators but $v_1$.

<p>The obstruction comes from Galois cohomology. I'm not so fluent in this, but here is the key point. Assume that $E/F$ is Galois.

$$\ker \big(H^1(\mathrm{Gal}(E/F), Z_G(M)(E)))\to H^1(\mathrm{Gal}(E/F), G(E)\big),$$

"2379858","2380190","<p>If you want to prove a statement of the form $\forall x (k &lt; x \rightarrow P(x))$ by induction, then the second method is really the only method you can use:</p>

<p>Since induction proves a statement of the form $\forall x \ \varphi(x)$, your $\varphi(x)$ will have to be all of $k &lt; x \rightarrow P(x)$ ... your first method really cannot be used, since you are not trying to prove $\forall x \ P(x)$ (or: as applied tyo your specific example: you are not trying to prove $\forall x \ 1 &lt; x + x$ ... since that is just not true!)</p>

<p>So, this means that the base case is:</p>

<p>$k &lt; 0 \rightarrow P(0)$</p>

<p>... which, as you point out, is easy to prove, since $k &lt; 0$ will be false, and hence $k &lt; 0 \rightarrow P(0)$ will be true.</p>

<p>For the step, you take some arbitrary $x$, and assume (inductive hypothesis) $k &lt; x \rightarrow P(x)$, and you now want to show $k &lt; s(x) \rightarrow P(s(x))$  (the expression $s(x)$ is what PA typically uses instead of $x + 1$)</p>

<p>Now, as again you say, this will be a bit tricky, since once you assume $k &lt; s(x)$ to set up the conditional proof, it of course does not follow that $k &lt; x$, since possibly $x = k$, and so it seems you can't use the inductive hypothesis. </p>

<p>However, the solution is easy:  If $k &lt; s(x)$, then it follows (this is easily proven in PA) that $k = x \lor k &lt; x$. So, do a proof by cases: </p>

<p>If $k = x$, then show the specific case that $P(s(k))$, from which $P(s(x))$ immediately follows</p>

<p>Hence, you get $P(s(x))$ in both cases, and that completes the conditional proof to get $k &lt; s(x) \rightarrow P(s(x))$</p>

"2379863","2379944","<p>Put $u = \sqrt{\dfrac{B}{A}}$, then we have:</p>

<p>$$1-x = u x^{1+\frac{\epsilon}{2}}= u x\exp\left[\frac{\epsilon}{2}\log(x)\right] = u x \left[1 + \frac{\epsilon}{2}\log(x) + \frac{\epsilon^2}{8}\log^2(x)+\cdots\right]$$</p>

<p>We then substitute the formal expansion:</p>

<p>$$x = x_0 + \epsilon x_1 + \epsilon^2 x_2 +\cdots$$</p>

<p>and expand the equation in powers of $\epsilon$ and equate equal powers of $\epsilon$. You then find the unperturbed solution:</p>

<p>$$x_0 = \frac{1}{1+u}$$</p>

<p>The coefficient of $\epsilon$ of the equation yields:</p>

<p>$$(1+u)x_1 + \frac{u}{2} x_0 \log(x_0) = 0$$</p>

<p>therefore:</p>

<p>$$x_1 = \frac{u\log(1+u)}{2(1+u)^2}$$</p>

<p>Extracting the coefficient of $\epsilon^2$ of the equation yields:</p>

<p>$$(1+u)x_2 + \frac{u}{2} x_1 \left[1+\log(x_0)\right] +\frac{u}{8}x_0\log^2(x_0)=0  $$</p>

<p>So, this way we get an expression for $x_2$ in terms of $u$ and it's easy to proceed in this way to find the higher order terms. A problem you may encounter when proceeding to higher and higher orders is that the perturbation series may not converge for the desired value of $\epsilon$. You can then resort to resummation methods.</p>

<p>This is called the exchange lemma, that if $v_{1},...,v_{m}\in V$ and the dimension of $V$ is less than $m$ then $v_{1},...,v_{m}$ is linearly dependent. </p>

"
"2379923","2380414","<p>Suppose $C$ is closed in $X$, this means that $U= X\setminus C$ is open in $X$.
This means that for all $i$, $X_i \cap U$ is open in $X_i$ or $X_i \setminus (X_i \cap U) = (C \cap X_i)$ is closed in $X_i$</p>

<p>So the closed sets of $X$ have an analogous description as the open sets of $X$. As the $X_i$ are closed, this is convenient: in all spaces $X$: if $A$ is closed in $B$ and $B$ is closed in $X$, then $A$ is closed in $X$.</p>

<p>$C \subseteq X_i$ is closed in $X_i$, then $C$ is closed in $X_{i+1}$ by the above fact and $X_i$ being closed in $X_{i+1}$ for all $i$. By induction we show that $C$ is closed in $X_j$ for all $j &gt; i$. And by definition $C \cap X_m$ is closed in $X_m$ for all $m &lt; i$ as well. It follows that $C$ is closed in $X$. And the reverse holds by the first paragraph. So the closed sets in $X_i$ are just the closed sets in $X$ intersected with $X_i$. This shows a). </p>

<p>In your proof, for $U_i \in \tau_i$ you claim that $U_i$ is open in all $X_j$; this does not always hold (e.g. $(0,1]$ is open in $[0,1]$ but not in $[0,2]$ nor $[0,n]$). This is the reason I went for closed sets, as there we do have ""closed in closed is closed"".</p>

<p>As to b): If $O \subseteq Y$ is open $f^{-1}[O] \cap X_i = f|_{X_i}^{-1}[O]$ is open in $X_i$ as $f|_{X_i}: X_i \to Y$ is continuous. So $f^{-1}[O]$ is open in $X$.  </p>

<p>In your proof $U_i$ need not be open in $X$ (being relatively open in a closed subset, e.g. $(0,1]$ is open in $[0,1]$ but not in the reals).</p>

<p>c) looks OK, though the hint is I think not needed;  choose $f_0:X_0 \to [0,1]$ such that $f_0[A \cap X_0] = \{0\}$ and $f_0[B \cap X_0] = \{1\}$. Then given $f_i: X_i \to [0,1]$ continuous with $f_i[A \cap X_i] = \{0\}$ and $f_i[A \cap X_i] = \{1\}$, and such that $f_i|_{X_{i-1}} = f_{i-1}$ for $i \ge 1$, then define $g : (A \cap X_{i+1}) \cup (B \cap X_{i+1}) \cup X_i$ by setting it to $0$ on the first set, $1$ on the second and $f_i$ on the third. This is a consistent definition, and so the pasting lemma for finitely many closed sets (as all these sets are closed in $X_{i+1}$) says that $g$ is continuous on its (closed) domain, and then its Tietze-extension $f_{i+1}: X_{i+1} \to [0,1]$ is as required for $i+1$. This concludes the recursive construction of the $f_i$. Then $f(x) = f_i(x)$ for $x \in X_i$ is well-defined (as every $f_i$ restricted to a lower-indexed $X_j$ is $f_j$ again, so all is consistent.) and continuous by b) and clearly $f[A]  =\{0\}$ and $f[B] = \{1\}$. Then finish as in your proof. </p>

<p>As to your proof: why is $A \cup B \cup X_i$ normal, so that Tietze applies? $A, B$ possibly live in all $X_i$? All we know is that $X_i$ is normal.. You just seem to copy the hint without critique or argument. </p>

"
"2379959","2380589","<p>The rules can be applied in any order. The first three rules are mutually exclusive, while the last rule corresponds corresponds to evaluating the <code>let</code>s from outside in. Obviously, the last rule trivially overlaps with all the others via the first context, <code>[ ]</code>, but this is unimportant. Using the second context <code>let x = [ ] in t</code> does overlap non-trivially with the third rule and corresponds to the decision between un-nesting a <code>let</code> and then evaluating outside in, or evaluating a nested <code>let</code> outside in and un-nesting it later. It's relatively easy to see that this ambiguity makes no difference. The last context <code>let x = v in e</code> looks like it might overlap with the first rule, but there are no reduction rules for <code>x y</code>, so whenever the first rule applies the fourth rule does not (except via the trivial context).</p>

<p>$(\lambda f.f x x x)$ is not a term in this calculus. The term that would correspond to this is $(\lambda f.\mathsf{let}\ f_1 = f x\ \mathsf{in\ let}\ f_2 = f_1 x\ \mathsf{in}\ f_2 x)$. (Or you could consider various ways of nesting the <code>let</code>s; it will just be undone by the second evaluation rule.) This is what it means to be in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-normal_form"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ANF (administrative normal form or A-normal form)</a> which is mentioned by only very briefly explained: ""That is, every intermediate value is abstracted out in a let binding."" However, it doesn't need to be explained because the syntax for terms enforces this.</p>

<p>When the syntax description states ""$x$, $y$, $z$ <strong>Variable</strong>"" it means the meta-variables $x$, $y$, and $z$ (and variations like $x'$ or $y_1$) represent variables in the syntax. Similarly, $v$ and variations always represent a value, and $s$, $t$, and $u$ always represent a term. This means that the rule <code>let x = y in t -&gt; [x:=y]t</code> only applies if $y$ is a variable. That rule does not allow, say, <code>let x = y z in t -&gt; [x:=(y z)]t</code>. This is the formalization of the comment by the authors that ""[r]eduction uses only variable/variable renamings instead of full substitution."" Similarly, ANF is enforced because in the syntax of terms the only applications allowed are variables applied to variables (i.e. $x\, y$). $(x\, y)\, z$ is not a term. If such expression were intended to be allowed, the syntax would have had something like $s\, t$.</p>

<p>So, it should be mostly clear by now, but the answer to your last question is that there are no ""implicit"" rules. Arbitrary lambda terms are not terms in this syntax, but they can be encoded into terms via translation to ANF which simply involves <code>let</code> binding all subterms so that all applications are variables applied to variables. This translation can easily be formalized: $$\begin{align}
\mathcal{A}(x) &amp; = x \\
\mathcal{A}(\lambda x.M) &amp; = \lambda x.\mathcal{A}(M) \\
\mathcal{A}(M N) &amp; = \mathsf{let}\ x_1 = \mathcal{A}(M)\ \mathsf{in\ let}\ x_2 = \mathcal{A}(N)\ \mathsf{in}\ x_1\, x_2 \\

"2379983","2379988","<p>You are right. In general, when the order of the numerator and the denominator are equal, as it is in your example, it is useful to check the behaviour of the function along lines of the form $y=kx$ for various values of $k$.

$$f(x,2x)=\frac{2x^2(x^2-4x^2)}{x^4+16x^4}=-\frac{6}{17}$$
but if you take $y=x$ you get $f(x,x)=0$, so the limit $\lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)}f(x,y)$ does not exist, as it has different limits along different lines approaching zero.</p>

"2380010","2383829","<p>I don't think equation (1) is equivalent to (2). What they do in that paper is introducing equation (2), which has an additional unknown, the function $\psi$.

The reason why they consider the parameter $c$ in the hyperbolic choice (3) is that when $c\to\infty$ equation (2) converges to equation (1), and so solutions of (3) should converge to solutions of (1).
This is what I think they mean with the sentence ""We try to choose $\mathcal{D}$ and the initial and boundary conditions for $\psi$ in such a way that a numerical approximation to (4), (5) is a good approximation to the original system (1c), (2)"".

So you can complete the square, then set the squared term to zero. However, this will only give you a minimum if the squared term's coefficient is positive.</p>

<p>You can also solve it via calculus, like DMcMor did. In general calculus is the way to go, but for quadratics completing the square is a nice alternative.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> $V(\alpha) = (x_{1}+x_{2}-2x_{3})\alpha^{2} - (2x_{2}-2x_{3})\alpha + x_{2} = a(\alpha - b)^{2} + c$ where $a = x_{1}+x_{2}-2x_{3}$, $b = (x_{2}-x_{3})/a$ and $c = x_{2} - ab^{2} = (x_{1}x_{2} - x_{3}^{2})/a$. Only if $a&gt;0$ will you actually get a minimum, in which case you have $\alpha = b$ and $V(\alpha_{min})=c$.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Since OP has stated $\alpha$ is restricted to the interval $[0,1]$ (correct me if the interval is not closed), it might be the case that the minimum obtained by either this method or calculus will lie outside that interval. In this case, one would pick the value that is as close as possible to that minimum - say you got $1.5$, you would choose $\alpha=1$. If you got $-0.5$, you'd pick $\alpha=0$. You can do this because a quadratic is monotonic either side of its turning point. In fact, if you don't find any turning points in the allowed interval, the function must be monotonic if it is continuous, so the minimum in that interval must be one of the two endpoints (and it's usually simple to determine which).</p>

"2380077","2380090","<p>You could use the <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LawofCosines.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Law of Cosines</a> (which you might think of as a super-powered version of the Pythagorean Theorem, which allows you to work with triangles that are not right triangles).

"2380081","2380224","<p>As has been discussed in the comments, the key observation is that for any $\alpha&lt;\omega^{\beta_1}$, $\alpha+\omega^{\beta_1}=\omega^{\beta_1}$.  It follows that \begin{align*}
\beta_0\cdot 2 &amp;= \omega^{\beta_1}\cdot m_1+(\omega^{\beta_2}\cdot m_2+\dots+\omega^{\beta_k}\cdot m_k+\omega^{\beta_1})+\omega^{\beta_1}\cdot(m_1-1)+\omega^{\beta_2}\cdot m_2+\dots+\omega^{\beta_k}\cdot m_k \\

In particular, taking $\alpha=\omega^{\gamma_0}$, we find $$\beta_0\cdot\omega^{\gamma_0}=\omega^{\beta_1}\cdot m_1\cdot \omega^{\gamma_0}=\omega^{\beta_1}\cdot\omega^{\gamma_0}$$ (the latter equality is because $m_1\cdot \omega^{\gamma_0}=\omega^{\gamma_0}$).</p>

"
"2380083","2380123","<p>according to your variables $u=x^2+y^2$ and $v=x$ you have a simplified equation:
$$y\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}=0$$
Since this equation must always hold (for any arbitrary value of $y$) the derivative of $f$ wrt. $v$ must be zero, and therefore $f$ must be a function of $u$ only:
$$f=h(u) = h(x^2+y^2)$$</p>

<p>Another approach is:</p>

<p>You can put your equation for $f(x,y)$:
$$ y\frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x}-x\frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial y}=0\tag{*}$$
 as the total derivative of $f$ wrt. some parameter $t$ supposing:
$$x=x(t) \qquad y=y(t)$$
 equated to $0$. This is:
$$\frac{df(x(t),y(t))}{dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dt}=0\tag{**}$$</p>

<p>You can immediately see that equations $(*)$ and $(**)$ have a lot in common, and they are identical iff:
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = y \qquad \frac{dy}{dt}=-x$$ 
The latter equations can be multiplied by $x$ and $y$ respectively and adding them toguether gives:
$$ x\frac{dx}{dt}+y\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}\left(x^2+y^2\right) = 0$$ </p>

<p>Therefore the taryectories described by curves on $xoy$ plane such as $x^2+y^2$ have a constant $f$ throughout the motion. Therefore, by equation $(**)$ the function $f$ must be a function of $x^2+y^2$, namely $f=h(x^2+y^2)$ since</p>

"2380101","2380153","<p>The pattern is more obvious if you write in base $2$:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}f(10011_2)&amp;=101_2\\
f(10100_2)&amp;=1010_2\\
f(10101_2)&amp;=10101_2\\
f(10110_2)&amp;=1010_2\\
f(10111_2)&amp;=101_2\\
...
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Show, in general, the value of $f(n)$ is the binary digits of $n$, removing repeated digits.</p>

<p>So, since $2011= 11111011011_2$, you get $f(n)=10101_2$, and you need to find all $n&lt;2011$ which can be written by taking $10101$ and expanding any digit by repeating digits.</p>

<p>These can be written as $2^{a}-2^{b}+2^{c}-2^d+2^e-1$ where $a&gt;b&gt;c&gt;d&gt;e&gt; 0$.</p>

<p>For example, $2011=2^{11}-2^{6}+2^{5}-2^{3}+2^{2}-1$.</p>

<p>There are $\binom{10}{5}=252$ cases $a\leq 10$. The cases where $a=11$ is harder - you need $b\geq 6$, and then have to continue counting cases.</p>

<p>The full count is, I think:</p>

<p>$$\binom{11}{5}-\binom{6}{4}+\binom{5}{3}-\binom{3}{2}+\binom{2}{1}-1$$</p>

<p>Essentially, $\binom{11}{5}-\binom{6}{4}$ counts the cases where $a\leq 11$, but removing the cases where $a=11$ and $b\leq 6$. Then $\binom{5}{3}-\binom{3}{2}$ count the cases where $a=11,b=6$, excepting the cases where $c=5,d\leq 3$. And $\binom{2}{1}-1$ counts the cases where $a=11,b=6,c=5,d=3.$ and the resulting number is not $n$.</p>

<p>Note that the top parts of the binomials are $11,6,5,3,2$, which are the exponents of $2011=2^{11}-2^6+2^5-2^3+2^2-1$. That might give you an idea for the general formula, given an $m$ for the count of $n&lt; m$ with $f(n)=f(m)$.</p>

<p>Every natural number $m\neq 0$ can be written uniquely as $m=\sum_{i=0}^{2k-1} (-1)^{i+1}2^{a_i}$, where $k\geq 1$ and $0\leq a_0&lt;a_1&lt;\dots&lt;a_{2k-1}$. If $m$ is odd, then $a_0=0$, and the number of $n&lt;m$ such that $f(n)=f(m)$ is:</p>

<p>$$\sum_{i=0}^{2k-1}(-1)^{i+1}\binom{a_i}{i}$$</p>

<p>So, for example, if $m=17=2^{5}-2^{4}+2^1-2^0$, you get $$\binom{5}{3}-\binom{4}{2}+\binom{1}{1}-\binom{0}{0}=10-6+1-1=4.$$</p>

<p>And the $n&lt;m$ with $f(n)=f(m)$ are $101_2,1001_2,1011_2,1101_2$.</p>

<p>If $m$ is even, then $a_0&gt;0$ and you get:</p>

<p>$$\sum_{i=0}^{2k-1}(-1)^{i+1}\binom{a_i}{i+1}$$</p>

<p>For example, if $m=26=11010_2=2^5-2^3+2^2-2^1$ then:</p>

<p>$$\binom{5}{4}-\binom{3}{3}+\binom{2}{2}-\binom{1}{1}=4$$</p>

"2380133","2380149","<p>First off, I think you mean $\mathbb{P}(\Omega) \cup \{\emptyset\}$ in your last line, as $\mathbb{P}(\Omega) \cup \emptyset = \mathbb{P}(\Omega)$.  But that is just a minor nitpick.</p>

<p>With regard to your question, recall that $\sigma(\mathbb{C})$ is the smallest $\sigma$-field that contains $\mathbb{C}$ (note that $\sigma(\mathbb{C}) \supseteq \mathbb{C}$, and not the other way around, as you wrote).  Thus it has to contain all of the sets of $\mathbb{C}$, and just enough extra sets to ensure that it is closed under complements and unions, and includes all of $\Omega$.</p>

<p>This is a relatively small example, so you should be able to brute force it.  Starting with $\mathbb{C}$, you need to throw in other sets so that you get the properties that you want (closure under unions, complements, etc).  So you might proceed as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>You know that $\mathbb{C}$ has to be in $\sigma(\mathbb{C})$, so start with that.  So far, we have $\{ \{2,4\}, \{6\} \}$.</li>
<li>You require $\Omega \in \sigma(\mathbb{C})$, so throw that in: $\{ \{2,4\}, \{6\}, \Omega \}$.</li>
<li>Now, $\sigma(\mathbb{C})$ has to be closed under complements, so include the complements of the three sets that are in there:  $\{ \{2,4\}, \{1,3,5,6\}, \{6\}, \{1,2,3,4,5\}, \Omega, \emptyset \}$.</li>
<li>Next, we need to make sure that we have closure under unions, which means that we need to throw in unions of any sets.  So... $\{2,4\} \cup \{1,3,5,6\}$ is already in the collection; $\{2,4\} \cup \{6\} = \{2,4,6\}$, and $\{1,3,5\} \cup \{6\} = \{1,3,5,6\}$ is already in the collection.  No other pairwise unions give us anything new, nor do unions including more sets.  So now we have the collection $\{ \{2,4\}, \{1,3,5,6\}, \{6\}, \{1,2,3,4,5\}, \Omega, \emptyset, \{2,4,6\} \}$.</li>
<li>We introduced a new set, so we ned to include its complement.  Throwing that in, we get $\{ \{2,4\}, \{1,3,5,6\}, \{6\}, \{1,2,3,4,5\}, \Omega, \emptyset, \{2,4,6\}, \{1,3,5\} \}$.</li>
<li>Again, check all unions.  In this case, taking the union of the new set $\{1,3,5\}$ with any other set in our collection gives us nothing new.  Therefore the collection in step 5 is closed under unions.  Since step 5 ensured that it was closed under complements as well, and step 2 included the entire space, this collection gets the job done.</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore
$$ \sigma(\mathbb{C})
= \{ \emptyset, \{6\}, \{2,4\}, \{1,3,5\}, \{2,4,5\}, \{1,3,5,6\}, \{1,2,3,4,5\}, \Omega \} $$
Note that this is not the powerset of $\Omega$, as (for example) none of the singleton sets other than $\{6\}$ are included.</p>

<p>That leads to $P(K=k\mid X=x)=P(K-1=k-1\mid X=x)=\binom{n-x-1}{k-1}p^{n-x-1-k}(1-p)^k$.</p>

"
"2380188","2381135","<p>Let me elaborate a bit more. </p>

<h2>Diagonal self-adjoint operators</h2>

<p>Let $\mathsf{H}$ be a (separable) Hilbert space with an orthonormal basis $(e_n)$. Take a non-empty compact set $K \subset \mathbb{R}$ and a sequence $(\lambda_n)$ of distinct points from $K$ such that the closure of the set $\{ \lambda_n \colon n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is $K$. 
We construct a self-adjoint operator on $\mathsf{H}$ with spectrum $\sigma(A)=K$ by setting
$$Ax = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\lambda_n \left&lt;x, e_n\right&gt;e_n$$ 
for all $x \in \mathsf{H}$.</p>

<p>The function $E \colon \mathcal{B}(K) \rightarrow B(\mathsf{H})$, where $\mathcal{B}(K)$ stands for the set of all bounded Borel function on $K$ and $B(\mathsf{H})$ is the space of linear bounded operators on $\mathsf{H}$, defined by 
$$E(B)x = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \textbf{1}_{B}(\lambda_n) \left&lt;x,e_n\right&gt;e_n$$
is the resolution of identity (spectral measure, <a href=""http://planetmath.org/spectralmeasure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a>) for $A$ and it is often denoted by $\mathbf{1}_B(A):=E(B)$ (this notation is consistent with the application of functional calculus, discussed further in the answer) for all $B \in \mathcal{B}(K)$. Furthermore the following holds
$$(\star) \ \ \qquad  Ax = \int_{\sigma(A)} \lambda \  E(\mathrm{d}x)x = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\lambda_n \left&lt;x, e_n\right&gt;e_n,$$
where $\int_{\sigma(A)} \lambda \  E(\mathrm{d}x)$ is an integral with respect to the spectral measure $E$ of $A$ (I'm not going to define this integral here, check this <a href=""http://planetmath.org/spectralmeasure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a>, $(\star)$ supposed to give the intuition). </p>

<h2>Notation</h2>

<p>In Physics people often use the Dirac notation, that is, since the above $A$ can be written by $\sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \lambda_n \left|e_n\right&gt;\left&lt;e_n\right|$ or even $\sum_{i}  \lambda_i  \left|i\right&gt; \left&lt;i\right|$ (if we use the notation $(\left|i\right&gt;)$ to denote the orthonormal basis) then the following notation can be often seen $$A = \int \lambda \ \mathrm{d}\left|i\right&gt;\left&lt;i\right|$$
for any self-adjoint operators (not-necessarily diagonal). </p>

<h2>General case</h2>

<p>Now take an arbitrary self-adjoint operator on $\mathsf{H}$ (not-necessarily diagonal). The spectral theorem states that
$$A = \int_{\sigma(A)} \lambda \ E(\mathrm{d}\lambda),$$
where $E$ is the corresponding resolution of identity (spectral measure) for $A$. </p>

<p>In particular, one may want to consider the Borel functional calculus. Given a bounded borel function $f \in \mathcal{B}(\sigma(A))$ we have that 
$$ f(A) = \int_{\sigma(A)} f(\lambda) \ E(\mathrm{d} \lambda).$$ </p>

<h2>Name</h2>

<p>The term identity in the name probably comes from the fact that
$$\mathbf{1}_{\sigma(A)}(A) = I_{\mathsf{H}},$$
and I think that resolution corresponds to the spectral form of the operator.</p>

<h2>Spectral theorem - different version</h2>

<p>There is also a multiplication operator version of the spectral theorem which says that any self-adjoint operator is unitarily equivalent to the operator of multiplication on some space $L^2(\mu)$ for some measure $\mu$. Recall that a multiplication operator with symbol $f\in L^{\infty}(\mu)$ is $M_f \in B(L^2(\mu))$ given by $(M_f g)(x) = f(x)g(x)$. One may want to check <a href=""http://www.math.wsu.edu/faculty/watkins/Math502/pdfiles/spectral.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this link for further information</a>. </p>

<p>In particular, the spectral measure for multiplication operator $M_f$ is given by $E(B) = \mathbf{1}_{f^{-1}(B)}$ for $B \in \mathcal{B}(\sigma(M_f))$.</p>
"
"2380189","2380242","<p>I want to explain the idea by Youem a bit more in detail.</p>

<p>If $(x_n)_n$ is bounded, there exists a convergent subsequence. Let $(x_{n_k})_k$ be such a sequence converging to some $x'$. Now $f(x_{n_k})$ converges to $f(x')$ (by continuity) and to $f(x)$ (by assumption). Using injectivity, it follows that $(x_{n_k})_k$ converges to $x$. </p>

<p>We now know that every convergent subsequence of $(x_n)_n$ has limit $x$. We still have to prove that $(x_n)_n$ is convergent. So let us assume that $(x_n)_n$ were not convergent. Then there exists a subsequence $(x_{n_k})_k$ such that $|{x_{n_k}} - x| &gt; \varepsilon$ for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and all $k$. Since $(x_{n_k})_k$ is bounded, this sequence has a convergent subsequence and by what we have proven so far, it has to converge to $x$. However, we also have 
$|{x_{n_k}} - x| &gt; \varepsilon$ for all $k$ which gives the desired contradiction.</p>

<p>Note that the target of $f$ did not really matter. It could be $\Bbb R$, $\Bbb C$ or any other topological space in which limits of sequences are unique. The domain of $f$ can be $\Bbb R$ or $\Bbb C$ or any other metric space in which bounded sequences have convergent subsequences. Surely, this is not the most general type of space, but I just wanted to note that this is not a special property of $\Bbb R$ or anything like this. Anyway the proof above works for 1. as well as for 3.</p>

"2380197","2380220","<p>For question $1$, I assume you meant $4^7$ rather than $4^4$?  (for there are $7$ people that can each order one of $4$ pizzas).</p>

<p>Anyway, that doesn't work as an answer to question $1$, because it would be $4^7$ only if the order of the people matters, but it doesn't.  For example, if Bob, Alice, Carrie, and Dave, Edgar, Felice, and Greg order (in the order as listed) pizzas $A,B,C,B,C,C,D$ respectively, then that it is in effect the same pizza order as when they would have ordered $B,C,B,A,C,D,C$:  it is still $1$ pizza $A$, $2$ pizza's $B$, $3$  pizza's $C$, and 1 pizza $D$.</p>

<p>For part $2$, you need to consider the chance of each of the possible orders being made and ordered.  Note that we are assuming that the 7 friends chose their pizzas randomly as well (not very realistic, but hey ...).  Anyway, as an example:</p>

<p>The pizza order $7$ pizza's $A$ has a chance of $1$ in $4^7$ of being ordered and has the same chance of being made. So, a match for that particular order is $1$ in $4^{14}$</p>

<p>But the pizza order I gave as an example earlier, $1$ pizza $A$, $2$ pizza's $B$, $3$  pizza's $C$, and 1 pizza $D$ has a much larger chance of being ordered and made: 7 different people could have ordered pizza $A$, and from the remaining $6$, there are ${6 \choose 2} = 15$ pairs of people that can order pizza $B$, etc.  So the chance of this order being ordered and made is:</p>

<p>$1$ in $( {7 \choose 1}\cdot {6 \choose 2} \cdot  {4 \choose 3} \cdot {1 \choose 1})^2$</p>

<p>So this is what you need to do for all possible orders.  As @S.Ong said, it's tedious.  (though mathematicians more clever than I am will probably know some better method that is far quicker than this ...)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, if we apply the Hahn-Banach separation theorem to the compact set $\{x\}$ and the closed convex set $cl(M)$, we obtain some $f\in X^*$ such that $f(\{x\})$ and $f(cl(M))$ are disjoint.  But then $f(cl(M))$ is a proper subspace of $\mathbb R$ (or $\mathbb C$), and thus $f(cl(M))=\{0\}$.  Since $f(cl(M))$ and $f(\{x\})$ are disjoint, we know $f(x)\neq0$.</p>

<p>Now we apply this result to your problem.  If $cl(R(A))\neq Y$, there is some non-zero $y\in Y$ such that $y\notin cl(R(A))$.  Now, the mentioned results guarantees the existence of some $y^*\in Y^*$ such that $y^*(y)\neq0$ but $y^*(cl(R(A)))=\{0\}$.  Thus $\langle y^*,Av\rangle=0$ for all $v\in V$.</p>

<p>1) A function must have the domain either explicitly or implicitly stated as part of the definition of a function.</p>

<p>A function is defined as $f: X \rightarrow Y$ where the function is a mapping between pairs of values of $X$ and values of $Y$ where each and every value of $X$ (the domain) is mapped, <em>exactly once</em>, to multiples of $Y$.  (Not every value of $Y$ needs to be mapped to, and a value of $Y$ may be mapped to several times but every value of $X$ must be mapped from and can only be mapped from once).</p>

<p>By definition, the domain $X$ is a specific part of $f$ and so to say ""what is the domain of $f$"" is simply a matter of well, what did you <em>define</em> the domain to be?""</p>

<p>However the domain may be implicit and not explicitly stated.  If $f(n) = \frac n2 - 7$ and its understood we are mapping natural numbers to natural numbers, It's not possible for <em>any</em> natural number to be input.  An odd number will not be mapped to any natural number.  Any number $14$ or less won't be mapped into a natural number either.  So implicitly the domain is $\{n \in \mathbb N: 2\mid n; n &gt; 14\}$.</p>

<p>Here we aren't told anything about what the input and output of $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ are  supposed to be.  Are the supposed to be natural numbers?  Integers?  Rationals?  Reals?  Complex?  A  vector space? The space of functions?  Bananas?</p>

<p>2) $\sqrt{x} = $ ""the square root of $x$"" is  ill-defined.  i) Depending upon what the output is supposed to be the input/domain is restricted.  If the output must be natural numbers the input must be a perfect square.  If the output must be real then input must be real non-negative.  ii) Given a domain of input there may be multiple options for the output.  e.g. The square root of 36 could be 6 or -6.  The square root of $-25$ could be 5i or $-5i$.  The square root of $i$ could be $\frac {\sqrt 2}2 + i \frac {\sqrt 2}{2}$ or $ - \frac {\sqrt 2}2 - i\frac {\sqrt 2}{2}$. etc.</p>

<p>And the thing is if we define with square root to ""pick"" we are implicitly indicating what the domain is.  If we say $\sqrt x$ is ""the positive one"" that implies $\sqrt x \in \mathbb R$ which implies $x \in (0, \infty)$. On the other hand is we claim the domain is $\mathbb R$ i.e. we so $x$ can be any real number. then for $x &lt; 0$ we have two possible square roots:  $ai$ and bi$ where $a^2 = |x|$ and $a = -b$. We could say pick the one where $a \ge 0$.  And if we want to say $x \in \mathbb C$ we would have to define a way of picking which of the two square roots we want.</p>

<p>In all of these though, choosing the domain, as well as the vaule of the range, is <em>not</em> a matter of answering a question.  It's a matter of making a choice in the definition of our function. </p>

<p>And we could choose anything we like.</p>

"2380314","2380322","<p>If $srs^{-1} = r$, then multiplying both sides on the right by $s$ you get that $sr = rs$, i.e., that $s$ and $r$ commute with each other.</p>

<p>Now, show that in ANY group, if you have two elements $a$ and $b$ that commute with each other, then the order of $ab$ divides the LCM of the orders of $a$ and $b$ <s>and is divisible by the GCD of the orders of $a$ and $b$.</s> and is divisible by the (LCM / GCD).</p>

<p>Edmonds, Allan L.; Ewing, John H.; Kulkarni, Ravi S.
Regular tessellations of surfaces and (p,q,2)-triangle groups. 
Ann. of Math. (2) 116 (1982), no. 1, 113–132. </p>

<p>From the MathReview of the paper: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The authors consider regular tessellations of type $(p,q)$ on a surface; a generalization of the Platonic solids. The parameter $p$ is the number of edges on each face while $q$ is the valence of each vertex. The main theorem states that as long as obvious necessary conditions, based on Euler's formula, are satisfied then a regular tessellation of type $(p,q)$ exists on a surface $M$. Furthermore, the edges can be geodesics and a classification of regular tessellations of type $(p,q)$ on $M$ is given based on $\pi_1(M)$. The main technique used to prove the theorem is construction of appropriate branched coverings over surfaces with irregular patterns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main result of their paper is Theorem 1:</p>

<p>Let $M$ be a closed surface and let $p, q, V, E, F$ be positive
 integers such that
 $$
V-E+F=\chi(M)$$
 and 
$$
pF=2E=qV$$</p>

<p>Then: There exists a $(p, q)$-tessellation on $M$ consisting of $F$ $p$-sided faces, $E$ edges and $V$ vertices each of valence $q$; except when $M$ is the projective plane, $(p, q) = (3,3)$, $V = F = 2$, and $E = 3$.</p>

<p>Note that the above conditions are also necessary for the existence of a $(p,q)$-tessellation. </p>

<p>An important remark: For this theorem to hold, some of the polygonal faces $\sigma$ of the tessellation are allowed to be ""singular'' in the sense that some of the edges of $\sigma$ are glued to each other on the surface $M$. A simple example of a singular face is the tessellation of the 2-torus which has unique 2-dimensional rectangular face, whose edges are identified in the standard manner. In other words, the CW complex underlying the tessellation, need not be regular. </p>

"2380365","2380398","<p>If my life depended on it, I would probably compute the seventh roots of $8$ and $9$ in base $2$ with the root algorithm used in written computation. Omitting details (the algorithms is actually a dichotomic search), the crucial step in the algorithm is to compute </p>

<p>$$(2x+1)^7,$$ where $x$ is an approximation. You can do this using the Binomial expansion (and noting that multiplying by a power of $2$ is a mere shift). The coefficients are $1,7,21,35,35,21,7,1$ (decimal).</p>

<p>But I guess that the computation via $y^7=y\,y^2(y^2)^2$ will be faster/simpler.</p>

<p>Next you convert to base $10$ and multiply by $112$. A first step is to determine the number of significant bits required. Count two of three hours of work.</p>

<hr>

<p>Alternatively, the seventh roots can be evaluated by Newton-Raphson, but this will take the evaluation of sixths powers and divisions.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another interesting alternative is the secant method, starting from the inequalities</p>

<p>$$1.3^7=6.2748517&lt;8&lt;9&lt;1.4^7=10.5413504.$$</p>

<p>As the curve is pretty flat, the next estimates are obtained by linear interpolation. Optionally, when a new approximation is obtained, it can be truncated to a smaller number of decimals to ease the evaluation of the seventh power.</p>

<p>For example, the next approximation of $\sqrt[7]8$ is $1.340434755\cdots$, and you can use $1.34$ instead.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you have a fast way to compute the square roots, by some magic, you can use the fixed-point iteration</p>

<p>$$x\leftarrow \sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt{yx}}},$$ the solution of which is $x=y^{1/7}$.</p>

"2380368","2380464","<p><strong>Succinct definition of boundary starting from open sets:</strong></p>

<p>Let $X$ be a set and its topology is just a collection $T\subset P(X)$ of some of its subsets that are going to be called open. The collection is required to have some properties which you can check in Wikipedia's article for topology.</p>

<p>The set $X$ with the collection $T$ is called a topological space.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>$X=\mathbb{R}$ and $T$ consist of the sets that can be obtained by making arbitrary unions of intervals of the form $(a,b)$.</li>
<li>$X=\mathbb{N}$ and $T$ consists of all possible subsets of $X$.</li>
<li>$X=\{3,4,5\}$ and $T$ consists of all possible subsets of $X$.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Interior:</strong> Given a topological space $X$ with topology $T$ and given a subset $A\subset X$, the <em>interior</em> of $A$ is the union of all elements of $T$ that are subsets of $A$.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> </p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li>The interior of $[a,b)$ in the topological space (1) is $(a,b)$.</li>
<li>The interior of $\{3,4,5\}$ in the topological space (2) is $\{3,4,5\}$.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Closure:</strong> Given a topological space $X$ with topology $T$ and given a subset $A\subset X$, the <em>closure</em> of $A$ is the complement of the union of all elements of $T$ that are completely outside of $A$.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<ol start=""6"">
<li>The closure of the example (4) is $[a,b]$</li>
<li>The closure of the example (5) is $\{3,4,5\}$</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Boundary:</strong> Given a topological space $X$ with topology $T$ and given a subset $A\subset X$, the <em>boundary</em> of $A$ is the difference of its closure minus its interior.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<ol start=""8"">
<li>The boundary of example (4) is $\{a,b\}$</li>
<li>The boundary of example (5) is empty</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong>The case of boundary of intervals in $\mathbb{R}$</strong></p>

<p>Given an finite interval that includes or not its extreme points ($A=(a,b)$, $[a,b)$, $(a,b]$, or $[a,b]$) it is always the case that its boundary is the set of its extreme points. </p>

<p>Observe that the interior is the interval excluding its extreme points $(a,b)$. This is an element of the topology (see example 1) and we cannot fit any more intervals without extreme points inside $A$.</p>

<p>The closure is always $[a,b]$. Observe that in the complement of $A$ we can fit the intervals $(b,+\infty)$ and $(-\infty,a)$. Any other is inside those two. The complement of $(-\infty,a)\cup(b,+\infty)$ is $[a,b]$, and that is the closure.</p>

<p>Finally the boundary is closure $[a,b]$ minus interior $(a,b)$. That is $\{a,b\}$.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Topology from metric</strong></p>

<p>Given a set $X$ and a metric $d$ on it. One can define a topology $T$ to consist of arbitrary unions of balls $B(a,r)=\{x\in X:\ d(a,x)&lt;r\}$.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<ol start=""10"">
<li>The usual topology in $\mathbb{R}$ is of this form. Observe that the intervals $(a,b)$ are just the balls $B(\frac{a+b}{2},\frac{b-a}{2})$.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong>Impossibility of a topology on $\mathbb{N}$ such that the boundary of finite intervals consists of its extreme points</strong></p>

<p>Assume we want to put a topology on $\mathbb{N}$ such that for every finite interval (finitely many consecutive integers) the boundary is its extreme points.</p>

<p>If the boundary of $A=\{a,a+1,a+2,...,a+n\}$ ought to be $\{a,a+n\}$. Then its interior would have to be $\{a+1,a+2,...,a+n-1\}$. Since $a$ and $n$ were arbitrary, that means (taking $n=1$) that all sets of the form $\{a\}$ are open (elements of the topology). By a property required for topologies, which you are supposed to read, this means that all subsets are open.</p>

<p>But if all subsets are open, then $A$ is open. Therefore, the interior of $A$ would have to be $A$ and its complement would have to be $A$ as well. This causes that the boundary is empty.</p>

<p>Thereofore, there is no such topology as we wanted. In particular, there is no such topology defined by a metric.</p>

<p>Specifically, $a \equiv_0 b$ if $a-b = k0$ for some nonzero integer $k$.  But this means that $a-b = 0$, which implies that $a=b$.  Hence $\overline{a} = \{a\}$ for each $a\in\mathbb{Z}$.

"2380417","2380421","<p>This doesn't seem to be any different from how we normally talk about equivalence classes:  the author defines a binary relation over a set $S$, where any two objects from the set are related 'if they provide the same answer to all queries'. This relation is obviously reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, and hence is an equivalence relation. And the equivalence class $C$ is still defined relative to any object $o$ in the set, in that it is the set of all objects from that set standing in that equivalence relation to the object $o$.  So this is all still relative to elements of the set.</p>

"
"2380437","2380477","<p>Not sure if there’s a neat direct way. But I learnt that the trick is to add another more conceptual equivalent statement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $K / F$ be a finite extension of fields and let $L$ be an algebraically closed field containing $K$. So we assume $F ⊆ K ⊆ L$. The following are equivalent:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>$K$ is a splitting field for some polynomial $f ∈ F[X]$.</li>
  <li>Every field embedding $σ \colon K → L$ fixing $F$ restricts to $K → K$.</li>
  <li>Every irreducible polynomial $p ∈ F[X]$ with some root $α ∈ K$ splits completely in $K$.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof</em>. (1) ⇒ (2): Let $f ∈ F[X]$ be a polynomial for which $K$ is a splitting field, say of degree $n$ and monic (without loss of generality). Then $f$ has $n$ roots $α_1, …, α_n ∈ K$ (possibly counted with multiplicites) and $f = (X - α_1)·…·(X - α_n)$ in $K$. Then $K = F(α_1, …, α_n)$, as the latter field is a subextension in which $f$ splits and $K$ is by definition the smallest such extension.</p>

<p>Let $σ \colon K → L$ be any field embedding fixing $F$. Then $σ$ map zeroes of $f$ to zeros of $f^σ = f$, that is: $f(\{α_1,…,α_n\}) = \{α_1,…,α_n\}$. As $σ$ fixes $F$ and $K = F(α_1,…,α_n)$, this implies $σ(K) ⊆ K$.</p>

<p>(2) ⇒ (3): Let $p ∈ F[X]$ be any irreducible polynomial with some root $α ∈ K$. We assume it’s nonzero and monic. Then $p$ splits in $L$ because $L$ is algebraically closed, say $p = (X - α_1)·…·(X - α_n)$ for some $α_1, …, α_n ∈ L$. Have a look at $E = F(α)$. Then we have $n$ maps $σ_1, …, σ_n$ all $E → L$ with $σ_i(α) = α_i$ for $i = 1, …, n$. (For this, we need $p$ to be irreducible!) We can extend those to maps $K → L$, which then have to restricct to maps $K → K$ by assumption. As $α_1, …, α_n$ are in the image of $σ_1, …, σ_n$, we therefore have $α_1, …, α_n ∈ K$ and so $p = (X - α_1)·…(X - α_n)$ in $K[X]$.</p>

<p>(3) ⇒ (1): As a finite extension, there are some $β_1, …, β_n ∈ K$ with $K = F(β_1, …, β_n)$ – for example, take an $F$-basis of $K$. Let $p_1, …, p_n ∈ F[X]$ be the minimal polynomials of $β_1, …, β_n$. Being irreducible, all of them split in $K[X]$, so $f = p_1·…·p_n ∈ F[X]$ does a well and $K$ then is the splitting field of $f$.</p>

<p>In $L$, the polynomial $p$ has to split: Let $α_1, …, α_n$ be the $n$ zeroes of $p$ in $L$. Then we have $n$ different field embeddings $σ_i \colon F(α) → L$ with $σ_i(α) = α_i$ for $i = 1, …, n$.</p>
"
"2380438","2380466","<p>You can take both $S_1$ and $S_2$ to be the space $H(\mathbb D)$ of functions $f$ analytic in the open unit disk $\mathbb D = \{z: |z| &lt; 1\}$.  Note that the Maclaurin series of such a function converges absolutely to the function in the disk, and uniformly on compact subsets of it; conversely if the series converges absolutely at points arbitrarily close to $1$, the radius of convergence is $1$.  Moreover, $|z^{n(n+1)}| \le |z^n|$ so 
$T(f) \in H(\mathbb D)$.</p>

<p>EDIT: I don't see how you get your integral</p>

<p>$$ \int_0^1 (I-T)f(x) \dfrac{dx}{\log x} = 1 $$</p>

<p>and the partial sums $$\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{\mu(k)}{k} (\log(k+1)-\log(k(k+1)+1))$$ </p>

<p>for $100 \le N \le 10000$ are all between $0.535$ and $0.868$.

"2380447","2380454","<p>Here $\subset$ must be interpreted as $\subseteq$ (i.e. equality is allowed), otherwise the statement is false.</p>

<p>$\text{ch}(x_1, \ldots, x_k) \subset \text{ch}(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ is obvious (any convex combination of $x_1, \ldots, x_k$ is a convex combination of $x_1, \ldots, x_n$: just give coefficient $0$ to $x_{k+1}, \ldots, x_n$).

"2380450","2380802","<p>A lot of reasoning is always omitted in it, so we have to always fill the gap of proofs of Rudin.</p>

<p>For the proof, you have to consider 2 cases.</p>

<p>Given a set $E$ measurable and $\epsilon&gt;0$, </p>

<ol>
<li>$\mu(E)&lt;\infty$</li>
</ol>

<p>In this case, by (a), we can choose a closed set $F$ with the measure $\mu(E-F)&lt;\epsilon$. 
Then since $F$ is $\sigma$-compact and of finite measure, we can choose a compact set $C\subset F$ such that $\mu(F-C)&lt;\epsilon$ </p>

<p>(Or, you may consider a increasing sequence of compact sets converging to $F$. Note that finite union of compact sets is compact.) </p>

<p>Thus we have $\mu(E-C)&lt;2\epsilon$ or $\mu(E)&lt;\mu(C)+2\epsilon$. I think the finiteness condition should be used here.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>$\mu(E)=\infty$</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd like to leave this case as an exercise since it is almost the same proof as above, except that we cannot use $\epsilon$ argument. Instead, you can choose a closed subset $F$ of infinite measure and a increasing sequence of compact sets in $F$ whose measure converges to $\infty$, which anyway implies that $\mu(E)=sup\{\mu(C): C \text{ is compact and }C\subset E \}$</p>
"
"2380455","2380462","<p>You can do $((10)^*1 + (01)^*)00(1+0)^*11(1+0)^*$. The first part should take care of any $01$ or $10$ substrings at the head.</p>

"2380467","2380476","<p>The isomorphism tells you that $\Gamma$ is generated by a single element $a$. W.l.o.g. $0&lt;a$ (otherwise take $-a$ as generator). Then $na\mapsto n$ gives you the desired isomorphism preserving the ordering.</p>

"2380480","2380481","<p>It is the $L_{p}$ norm that is used here. To see why, just note that every norm $|| \cdot ||$ can induce a metric by $(x,y) \mapsto || x - y ||$.</p>

"2380506","2380588","<p>Revised 8 August.
Since $|z+x|^m$ is convex for all $z\in\mathbb R$ and $m\ge 1$, if  $m\ge 1$ then $f$ is convex.  </p>

<p>In general, if $m&gt;0$ then $f(x)$ is convex near $x=0$.  This follows from the formula $$f(x) = 2^{m/2}\frac{\Gamma\big(\frac{1+m}2\big)}{\sqrt{\pi}} M(-m/2, 1/2;  -x^2/2),$$  where $M$ is the confluent hypergeometric function, a.k.a. ${{}_1}F_1$.  The Taylor expansion of $M(-m/2,1/2; -x^2/2) $ starts out  $1+\frac m 2 x^2 +\ldots$ from which $f''(0)&gt;0$ follows.  Thus $f$ is concave for no value of $m&gt;0$.</p>

<p>Added 16 August, revised 18 August.  I believe that for $0&lt;m&lt;1$, there exists an $x_m&gt;0$ such that $f$ is convex on $[0, x_m]$ and concave on $[x_m,\infty)$. But I don't see a proof yet.</p>

<p>This would imply that, in the case $m&lt;1$,  the upper concave envelope $f^*$ of $f$ interpolates linearly between $f(0)$ and $f(x_m)$ on the range $[0,x_m]$ and is equal to $f$ on $[x_m,\infty)$, which in turn has implications for the OP's motivating optimization problem.</p>

"2380549","2380790","<p>Making the problem more general, let us consider $$T=P\left [1+\sum_{i=1}^{n}a^i \right ]$$ and remember the geometric series
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}a^i =\frac{a \left(a^n-1\right)}{a-1}$$ Now, rearrange to isolate the term $a^n$ and get $$a^n=\frac{(a-1) T+P}{a P}$$ Now take logarithms of both sides to get $$n=\frac{\log\left(\frac{(a-1) T+P}{a P} \right) }{\log(a)}$$ which is the exact solution.</p>

<p>If $x\in (-2,2)$, then we have that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n+1}e^{ \frac{n\pi x}{2}i}$ converges. In fact,

<p>$$\left | \sum_{n=1}^{N}(-1)^{n+1}e^{ \frac{n\pi x}{2}i}\right| \leqslant M $$</p>

<p>And since, $\{\frac{1}{n}\}_{n\geqslant 1}$ is a non-increasing sequence of real number such that, as $n \to \infty$, $ \frac{1}{n} \to 0$, we can apply Dirichlet's test to conclude that, if $x\in (-2,2)$, then $F(x)$ converges. </p>

<p>So we have prove that, for all $x\in (-2,2)$, </p>

<p>$$ F(x) = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}e^{ \frac{n\pi x}{2}i}$$ </p>

<p>Now, note that </p>

<p>$$f(x) = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}\sin \frac{n\pi x}{2}$$</p>

<p>is the imaginary part of $F(x)$. So we have that, for all $x\in (-2,2)$, </p>

<p>$$f(x) = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}\sin \frac{n\pi x}{2}$$</p>

<p>Note that for all $N \geqslant 1$, $f_N$ is continuous on $[-2,2]$. Note also that $f$ (defined by $f(x)=x$ is also continuous on $[-2,2]$.</p>

<p>From item 2, we know that, for all $x\in (-2,2)$, $f_N(x)$ converges to $f(x)$. However, for $x=-2$, for all $N\geqslant 1$, $f_N(-2)=0$ and $f(-2)=-2$. In a similar way, for $x=2$, for all $N\geqslant 1$, $f_N(2)=0$ and $f(2)=2$.</p>

<p>So $f_N$ does not converge uniformly to $f$ on $(-2,2)$. </p>

<p>In fact, suppose $f_N$  converges uniformly to $f$ on $(-2,2)$. Then there is $N_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for any $N&gt;N_0$, and any $x \in (-2,2)$,</p>

<p>$$|f_N(x)-f(x)| &lt;1/2$$</p>

<p>In particular, for any $x \in (-2,2)$,</p>

<p>$$|f_{N_0+1}(x)-f(x)| &lt;1/2  \tag{1}$$</p>

<p>But, since $f_{N_0+1}$ is continuous on $[-2,2]$, there is $\delta_1&gt;0$ such that, for all  $x \in (-2,-2+\delta_1)$</p>

<p>$$|f_{N_0+1}(-2)-f_{N_0+1}(x)| &lt;1/2 \tag{2} $$</p>

<p>Since $f$ is continuous on $[-2,2]$, there is $\delta_2&gt;0$ such that, for all  $x \in (-2,-2+\delta_2)$</p>

<p>$$|f(x)-f(-2)| &lt;1/2 \tag {3}$$</p>

<p>Take $\delta = \min\{\delta_1, \delta_2\}$. Combining $(1)$, $(2)$, $(3)$, we have, for all  $x \in (-2,-2+\delta)$</p>

<p>\begin{align*} 2 = &amp;|f_{N_0+1}(-2) - f(-2)| \leqslant \\ &amp; \leqslant  |f_{N_0+1}(-2)- f_{N_0+1}(x)|+ |f_{N_0+1}(x)-f(x)| + |f(x)-f(-2)|&lt; \\ &amp;&lt; (1/2)+ (1/2)+(1/2) =3/2
\end{align*}
Contradiction. So we have proved that $f_N$ does not converge uniformly to $f$ on $(-2,2)$. </p>

"2380669","2380675","<p>In integration theory when you want to use a u-subsitution you have to use a function which is a $C^1$-diffeomorphism. Otherwise you could end up with funny things.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> Actually a diffeomorphism is not necessary as pointed out by @zhw. To apply the substitution $x=\psi(u)$ from $u \in [c,d]$ to $x \in [a,b]$ you ""only"" need to have $\psi$ to be $C^1$ and $\psi([c,d])$ included in the domain of $f$, with $\psi(c)=a$ and $\psi(d)=b$.</p>

<p>For example if you want to compute $\int_{-1}^1 x^2\mathrm{d}x$, using a u-substitution $u=x^2$ will change the bounds to $1$ and $1$ and give 0, which is not true. This is because the function $x \in [-1,1] \mapsto x^2$ is not a bijection.</p>

<p>In your case your function $x \in [a, b] \mapsto x(x-a-b)$ has the following  graph for $a=-1$ and $b=1$. You clearly see that this function is not 1-1. <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M61GR.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M61GR.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The fact that your substitution is not 1-1 is clearly due to the square. Let $\phi: x \in [a,b] \mapsto x(x-a-b)$. The function $\phi$ reaches its minimum in $c=(a+b)/2$ and is bijective on $[a, c]$ and on $[c, b]$. If you split your integral into 2 integrals on these intervals you can use your substitution.</p>

<p>You would get $\int_a^b f(x) \mathrm{d}x=\int_a^c f(x)\mathrm{d}x + \int_b^c f(x)\mathrm{d}x$</p>

<p>Now use $u=\phi(x)=x(x-a-b)$.
You have therefore $x=\dfrac{a+b-\sqrt{(a+b)^2+4u}}{2}=\psi_1(u)$ on $[a,c]$ and $x=\dfrac{a+b+\sqrt{(a+b)^2+4u}}{2}=\psi_2(u)$ on $[c,b]$</p>

<p>This would give $$\int_a^b f(x) \mathrm{d}x=\int_{-ab}^{-(a+b)^2/4}f(\psi_1(u))\psi_1'(u)\mathrm{d}u + \int_{(a+b)^2/4}^{-ab}f(\psi_2(u))\psi_2'(u)\mathrm{d}u$$</p>

<p>And you see that you cannot ""merge"" these two integrals because their content is now different.</p>

<p>Of course this u-substitution does not seem to help a lot to compute the integral, particularly because $f$ is general. But if $f$ has a particular form, maybe this could help.</p>

"2380723","2380749","<p>Interpreting the math as a computer program, which is often called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pseudocode</a>, we have:</p>

<p>I've added comments in bold, hoping that this makes things more clear.  So at the end of this code, we have $a=30$ and $b=50$.  For the next code, I've added a loop:</p>

"
"2380726","2381911","<p>I will work out a hypothetical example.  You should be able to adapt this to your needs.  </p>

<p>This cryptanalysis assumes the plaintext was in natural and grammatical written English.  (As you're working in $\mathbb{Z}_{26}$ I believe this is safe to assume.)  </p>

<p>The hard part of breaking Hill is that you must make two very good guesses about your original plaintext.  These guesses are more sensitive than the ""most common character"" kind of guess you make on, say, an affine cipher.  So, it is easier to guess wrongly, in which case you must guess again.</p>

<p>Let's suppose that the (unknown) invertible key matrix is
$$
K = \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d\end{pmatrix}.
$$
Your first assignment is to find the first <strong>and second</strong> most common digraphs (or bigrams) in your intercepted ciphertext.  For you this will be hard because your ciphertext is too short:  ""su"" is the most common at 4 occurrences, but then there is (unfortunately for you) a 5-way tie for the second-most common bigram, each occurring 3 times.  </p>

<p>For my hypothetical example, let's suppose that everything is more clear cut, and that the most common bigram is <strong>fv</strong>  and the second-most common is <strong>qt</strong>.  This means, respectively, that the column vectors $(5,21)^t$ and $(16,19)^t$ are the first- and second-most common cipher-image vectors.  </p>

<p>Here's where we make an assumption on our plaintext.  The best probabilistic guess is that <strong>th</strong> and <strong>he</strong> are the first- and second-most common bigrams in the plaintext.  This isn't hard to believe, but is often wrong in practice, especially for smaller plaintexts.  Since <strong>th</strong> is $(19,7)^t$ and <strong>he</strong> is $(7,4)^t$ this gives us a pair of equations:
$$
K(19,7)^t = (5,21)^t\\
K(7,4)^t = (16,19)^t.
$$</p>

<p>However, we can be slicker and take these two matrix-by-column=column equations and stack the columns next to each other to give a <strong>single</strong> matrix-by-matrix=matrix equation.  In my example we get
$$
\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 19 &amp; 7 \\ 7 &amp; 4\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 &amp; 16 \\ 21 &amp; 19\end{pmatrix}.
$$</p>

<p>Now we can easily solve for $K = \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d\end{pmatrix}$ since $\begin{pmatrix} 19 &amp; 7 \\ 7 &amp; 4\end{pmatrix}$ is invertible (this is a <strong>very</strong> happy coincidence of the English language).  </p>

<p>In fact, this latter matrix has determinant 1, so it is even easier to invert.  Doing so, its inverse is
$$
\begin{pmatrix} 4 &amp; 19\\ 19 &amp; 19\end{pmatrix}.
$$</p>

<p>Now we can right-multiply (be careful!) in our equation above and directly solve for $K$:
$$
K = \begin{pmatrix} 5 &amp; 16 \\ 21 &amp; 19\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 4 &amp; 19\\ 19 &amp; 19\end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix} 12 &amp; 9 \\ 3 &amp; 6\end{pmatrix}.
$$</p>

<p>This is your absolute best key-guess.  Try to decrypt your ciphertext under this key and see if you get decent plaintext.  If not, you must make new guesses and restart the whole process again. Good luck!</p>

"2380744","2380757","<p>First of all, you <em>can</em> quantify over classes in NBG: in NBG, unlike ZFC, variables can refer to classes, and you are free to quantify over these variables.  So there is no difficulty at all formulating something like recursion over $Ord$ in NBG.</p>

<p>In ZFC, you are correct that since you can only refer to classes by writing down specific formulas, you can only prove that a class with certain properties ""exists"" by exhibiting a formula for it.  As for uniqueness, it doesn't actually present any challenge you haven't already described how to handle.  Just like you handled ""for all $G:V\to V$"" by a theorem schema, you can handle the universal quantifier in expressing uniqueness by a theorem schema.  That is, for each pair of formulas $F$ and $F'$, you have a separate theorem saying that if $F$ and $F'$ both satisfy the condition then $F$ and $F'$ define the same class.</p>

<p>In certain specific examples, there may be ways to indirectly make quantified statements over classes with just a single sentence in ZFC.  For instance, consider the statement ""there exists a class which is a well-ordering of $V$"".  A priori, this cannot be expressed in ZFC without specifying a specific formula which you are using to well-order $V$.  However, you can prove a theorem that says there exists a class which well-orders $V$ iff there exists a set $A$ such that $V=HOD[A]$.  More precisely, assuming $V=HOD[A]$, you can write down a specific class which well-orders $V$, and you can prove a theorem schema saying that for any class $F$, if $F$ well-orders $V$, then there exists a set $A$ such that $V=HOD[A]$.  So for practical purposes, you can use the statement ""there exists a set $A$ such that $V=HOD[A]$"" (which is a perfectly good sentence in the language of ZFC) as a proxy for the statement ""there exists a class which is a well-ordering of $V$"".</p>

"2380822","2389457","<p>Let's just carry your first case to its logical conclusion.
Let $\hat{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{|D|\times(m+1)}$, $\hat{W}\in\mathbb{R}^{(1+m)\times n}$, ${X}\in\mathbb{R}^{|D|\times m}$, ${W}\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, $\vec{1}\in\mathbb{R}^{|D|\times 1}$ be the vector of ones, $W_i$ be the $i$th column of $W$, and $b\in\mathbb{R}^{1\times n}$. Then your case 1 looks like:
$$
y = \hat{X}\hat{W} = \left[\vec{1}\; X\right]\begin{bmatrix}b\\ W\end{bmatrix}=
\left[b_1\vec{1}+XW_1,\ldots,b_n\vec{1}+XW_n\right]=\vec{1}b+XW=B+XW
$$ where $B=\vec{1}b=\vec{1}\otimes b\in\mathbb{R}^{|D|\times n}$.

<p>Personally, I'd write it like this. For a single artificial neuron (with weight vector $w=\langle w_1,\ldots,w_n\rangle$), let $\sigma:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be the sigmoid function (or e.g. tanh; doesn't matter), input $x_i$, and scalar bias $b$.</p>

<p>Then the output of the node on input $i$ is:
$$
y_i = \sigma(w\cdot x_i + b) = \sigma\left(b+\sum_{k=1}^n w_kx_{ik} \right)
=\sigma\left(w_01+w_1x_{i1}+\ldots+w_nx_{in} \right)=\sigma(\tilde{w}\cdot\tilde{x}_i)
$$
where we renamed $b=w_0$, and let $\tilde{w}=[w_0\;\, w]$, $\tilde{x}_i=[1\;\,x_i]$ by concatenation.</p>

"2380829","2381755","<p>I'm afraid there is no canonical choice. </p>

<p>Let $F$ be the set of $C^1$-smooth functions $f: \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ for which the seminorm 
$$\|f\|_F = \sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}} |x^2f'(x)|$$ 
is finite. Then $E = \{f\in F:\|f\|=0\}$ is one-dimensional, the space of constant functions. </p>

<p>However, different choices of complements of $E$ yield inequivalent norms on $F$. For example, we could take $H=\{f\in F: f(1)=0 \}$, leading to the norm 
$$\|f\|_1 =  \|F\|_F + |f(1)|$$
Or take  $H=\{f\in F: f(-1)=0 \}$, leading to the norm 
$$\|f\|_{2} =  \|F\|_F + |f(-1)|$$
These two are not comparable, and do not yield the same topology on $F$. Indeed, the sequence of functions 
$$
f_n(x) = \begin{cases} 0,\quad &amp;x\le 0, \\  n^2x^2,\quad &amp;0\le x\le 1/n \\ 
2-n^2(x-2/n)^2,\quad &amp; 1/n \le x \le 2/n \\   2  \quad &amp; x\ge 2/n
\end{cases}
$$
converges to $0$ in the second norm  but not the first. To check this, notice that 
$$
f_n'(x) = \begin{cases} 0,\quad &amp;x\le 0, \\  2n^2x,\quad &amp;0\le x\le 1/n \\ 
 -2n^2(x-2/n),\quad &amp; 1/n \le x \le 2/n \\   0  \quad &amp; x\ge 2/n
\end{cases}
$$
hence $\|f_n\|_F\to 0$. Since $f_n(-1)=0$, we get $\|f_n\|_2 \to 0$. But $f_n(1) = 2$ for large $n$, so $\|f_n\|_1\to 2$.</p>

<hr>

<p>The underlying problem is that to form a norm (or locally convex topology) one essentially needs some linear functionals that are not constant on $E$, i.e., not continuous with respect to $F$-seminorm. And there is no canonical choice of discontinuous linear functionals on a normed space... as Tolstoy wrote, every discontinuous linear functional is discontinuous in its own way.</p>

"2380843","2380860","<p>I suggest trying the substitution $u=\frac yx$ and $v=x^2+4y^2$. Solving for $x$ and $y$ yields $x=\sqrt{\frac{v}{1+4u^2}}$ and $y=u\sqrt{\frac{v}{1+4u^2}}$. With a little effort, $\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(u,v)}=-\frac{1}{8u^2+2}$ and this problem reduces to integrating $f(u,v)=\frac{u}{8u^2+2}$ over the rectangular subset of the $(u,v)$ plane $[0,1]\times[0,4].$ You get $\frac{\ln(5)}{4}.$</p>

"2380844","2380852","<p>$\sin x$ is increasing on the interval, starting at $0$ and ending at $1/\sqrt{2}$. $\cos x$ is decreasing on the interval, starting at $1$ and ending at $1/\sqrt{2}$, so $\cos x$ is bigger.

Since $\cos 2x$ is decreasing from $1$ to $0$ on the same interval, it must be decreasing faster, so $\cos x$ is bigger than that. Lastly, since $\sin x \leq 1, \sin x \cos x \leq \cos x$, so yet again, $\cos x$ is bigger.

"
"2380845","2380868","<p>With your notation, $\frac{s(t+h)-s(t)}{h}$ is the average rate of change of the $x$ coordinate of the particle in the interval of time $(t,t+h)$, which is the same as the average of the $x$ component of the (instantaneous) velocity of the particle in that time interval. If $h\to 0$ this quantity becomes the $x$ component of the instantaneous velocity of the particle at time $t$, usually denoted by $v_x(t)$. This is just one of the three Cartesian components of the instantaneous velocity, so in general it is not the same as the instantaneous velocity. In one dimensional motion along the $x$ axis, you could identify the instantaneous velocity $\vec v$ with its only component $v_x$, although technically there are no the same, one is a vector the other is a component: $\vec v =v_x\hat i$. For three dimensional motion you will need also the $y$ and $z$ components of the velocity to get the instantaneous velocity.</p>

<p>Most people will use $x(t)$ for the position of the particle in the $x$ axis, and some will use $s(t)$ for the total distance traveled by the particle since $t=0$ along its trajectory (not necessarily the $x$ axis). In that case $\frac{s(t+h)-s(t)}{h}$ is the average rate at which distance is being traveled, and its limit as $h\to0$ the instantaneous speed $v(t)$ of the particle (do not confuse it with the instantaneous velocity $\vec v(t)$ of the particle, which is a vector, $v=|\vec v|$). Note that in general $v_x$ is not the same as $v$ even in one dimensional motion, in which case $v=|v_x|$. The component $v_x$ can be negative, but $v$ is always non-negative.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>It means that there exists a sentence $\psi$ that doesn't have a truth value(i.e., neither true nor false.)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>No. The situation is really quite different from your example where $\Gamma=\{P,Q\}$ and we want to know the truth-value of $R$.  In that case, we could consider interpretations relative to $\Gamma$ that simply do not consider $R$, and you could in some sense say that $R$ does not have a truth-value (some will disagree and say that as soon as you refer to a proposition $R$ it must have a truth-value, which is why I say 'in some sense').  </p>

<p>In the case of Godel and arithmetic, however, $\Gamma$ is a first-order logic theory of arithmetic, meaning that it contains sentences described by the language of arithmetic, which includes symbols $\mathbf{0}$, $\mathbf{s}$, $\mathbf{+}$, and $\mathbf{\cdot}$. The sentence $\phi$ (called the 'Godel sentence) is expressed in this language as well.  As such, any interpretation for $\Gamma$ is an interpretation of the the language of arithmetic, and thus the Godel sentence $\phi$ will always have a truth-value.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li>It means that there exists a sentence $\psi$ having a truth value, but we don't know.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  The Godel sentence $\phi$ such that $\Gamma\not\vdash \phi$ and $\Gamma\not\vdash\neg\phi$ for any consistent formal arithmetical theory $\Gamma$, when interpreted by the standard interpretation $N$ (which has as domain $\mathbb{N}$, and which maps $\mathbf{0}$ to $0$, $\mathbf{s}$ to $s$ (successor function), $\mathbf{+}$ to $+$, and $\mathbf{\cdot}$ to $\cdot$)), ends up saying ""I ($\phi$) cannot be derived from $\Gamma$"".  And since $\Gamma \not \vdash \phi$, it indeed cannot be derived from $\Gamma$, and thus it is true under the standard interpretation. </p>

<p>And when mathematicians talk about sentences being true, they of course use the 'standard interpretation' of their language.  In other words, $\phi$ is as much 'true' as '1+1=2'.  .... which in mathematics we simply consider true, period. So, $\phi$ is true, period.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""3"">
  <li>It means that there exists a true sentence $\psi$, but $\Gamma\not\vdash \psi$ and $\Gamma\not\vdash\neg\psi$. (ps: this saying is so blurred, how does ""true"" mean by him? Under what model? Under all model?)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. ""true"" under the 'standard interpretation', i.e. 'true' by normal mathematical standards, i.e. true in as much any other mathematical theorem is considered true.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""4"">
  <li>There exists sentence $\psi$ such that $\Gamma\not\vdash \psi$ and $\Gamma\not\vdash\neg\psi$, and there exists some model $\mathfrak{A}$ such that $\mathfrak{A}\vDash\Gamma$ and $V_{\mathfrak{A}}(\psi)=T$, and at the same time there also exist some model $\mathfrak{B}$ such that $\mathfrak{B}\vDash\Gamma$ and $V_{\mathfrak{B}}(\psi)=F$.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes ...  but this is a weaker statement than 3.  We don't just mean 'some' model; we mean the 'standard model', i.e. we mean 'true' by normal mathematical standards. Again, it is as true as any other mathematical theorem.  So yes, there does exist a model in which it is true (namely the 'standard model'), and there is also a model (a 'non-standard model' or 'non-standard interpretation') in which it is false.  And we know the latter, since because:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""5"">
  <li>There exists sentence $\psi$ such that $\Gamma\not\vdash \psi$ and $\Gamma\not\vdash\neg\psi$, and for any model $\mathfrak{A}$ that $\mathfrak{A}\vDash\Gamma$, then $V_{\mathfrak{A}}(\psi)=T$.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Is definitely false!  If $\phi$ is true under any interpretation, then $\vDash \phi$, and since first-order logic itself is complete (This is Godel Completeness Theorem (for logic),  not to be confused with his Incompleteness Theorem (for arithmetic)), $\phi$ can be derived from nothing (i.e. $\vdash \phi$) and so certainly from $\Gamma$ (i.e. $\Gamma \vdash \phi$.). So this is why in 4. we know there must be at least one model that sets $\phi$ to False.</p>

<p>To sum up: out of these 5, only 3 and 4 are true, and 3 is the best way to think about it: ""Given any consistent set of axioms about arithmetic, there is always some arithmetical truth that cannot be derived from those axioms.""  Or even shorter: ""arithmetic is not axiomatizable"", or shorter yet: ""arithmetic is incomplete""</p>

<p>P.s. It should really be: ""Any <em>recursive</em> and consistent set of axioms for arithmetic is incomplete"". For simplicity sake you can think of 'recursive' as 'finitely expressible' ... for if you don't put in that constraint, you can simply choose all arithmetical truths as your 'axiom set', and that axioms set is of course both consistent and complete. </p>

This is the key.

<p>So let’s take instead a more general abelian group $H = (H,+,0)$. Then we have a map
$$\operatorname{Mat}_{n×n}(ℤ) → \operatorname{End}(H^n),~A ↦ m_A$$

If you write $(x_1, …,x_n)$ as a column $x = \Big[\begin{smallmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{smallmatrix}\Big]$, you probably recognize this as the matrix product $m_A \colon x ↦ Ax$.

<p>In particular, the identity matrix $E_n$ is sent to the identity $m_{E_n} = \mathrm{id}_H$ and if $A$ is invertible with inverse $B$, so is $m_A$ with inverse $m_B$. Thus, $m$ restricts to a <em>group homomorphism</em>
$$m \colon \operatorname{GL}_n (ℤ) → \operatorname{Aut}(H^n),$$
the image of an invertible matrix being an invertible endomorphism of $H^n$.</p>

"2380944","2382046","<p>Let me convert my comment to a full answer: </p>

<p><em>Unless one is (and you are not!) planning to write a PhD thesis in General Topology, Munkres is (more than) enough</em>.  </p>

<p>Depending on what you are planning to study later, you might encounter an issue requiring a bit more General Topology (e.g. proper maps and proper group actions, which you will find in Bourbaki), but you learn this on ""need to know"" basis (just pick up a General Topology book and look it up when necessary). Instead, my suggestion is to start reading Guillemin and Pollack, and Hatcher (or Massey). </p>

<p>In addition, you would want to (or, rather, have to) learn more functional analysis (say, Stein and Shakarchi) and PDEs (say, Evans) which will be handy if you are planning to go into modern differential topology (which most likely will require you dealing with nonlinear PDEs, believe it or not), and, in case of algebraic topology, - basic category theory (at least be comfortable with the language), Lie theory (at least to know the basic correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras), see suggestions <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/194419/whats-a-good-place-to-learn-lie-groups"">here</a>. Yes, General Topology is fun and there are many neat old theorems that you will learn by studying it in more detail, but you have to prioratize: Life is short and your time in graduate school is even shorter. </p>

Generally, if $Y = g(X)$, and $g$ is monotone increasing function then

"2380962","2381214","<p>Some observations: the standard notation for the $k$-th prime is $p_{k}$ or $q_{k}$. The symbol $\pi\left(k\right)$ usually represents the counting function of primes up to $k$, i.e., $$\pi\left(k\right)=\sum_{p\leq k}1,\,p\mathrm{\,is\,a\,prime\,number}.$$ Assuming that with the symbol $\pi\left(k\right)$ you intend $p_{k}$, you may observe that $$\sum_{k\geq n}\frac{1}{p_{k}p_{k+1}}\leq\sum_{k\geq n}\frac{p_{k+1}-p_{k}}{p_{k}p_{k+1}}=\sum_{k\geq n}\left(\frac{1}{p_{k}}-\frac{1}{p_{k+1}}\right)=\frac{1}{p_{n}}$$ and since <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime-counting_function#Inequalities"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">we know</a> that $$p_{n}&gt;n\log\left(n\log\left(n\right)\right)-n,\,n\geq2$$ we get $$S&lt;\sum_{k\leq n-1}\frac{1}{p_{k}p_{k+1}}+\frac{1}{n\log\left(n\log\left(n\right)\right)-n}$$ so taking, for example, $n=11$, we obtain $$S&lt;\sum_{k\leq10}\frac{1}{p_{k}p_{k+1}}+\frac{1}{11\log\left(11\log\left(11\right)\right)-11}\approx \color{red}{0.334}.$$</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>constructive and intuitonistic mathematics</strong>: is probably not easy to get into for the average mathematician, since there are many possible pitfalls.

There are 5 different notions given on <a href=""https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/finite+set"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the nLab</a> that are all equivalent in $\mathsf{ZFC}$ but generally not equivalent in constructive mathematics. Parts of measure theory and topology get extra complicated since the classical notions start to ""fall apart"" (c.f. <a href=""https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Cheng+space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cheng spaces</a> and <a href=""https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locale"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">locales</a>). The situation gets even spicier if we start to contradict the law of excluded middle (c.f.

<li><strong>inconsistent / paraconsistent mathematics</strong>: this even much more obscure than constructive mathematics. The basic idea is the if we get rid of <em>ex falso quodlibet</em> then we are allowed to talk about contradictory statements without our logic becoming trivial (note that this usually stops the disjunctive syllogism from working). You can try to <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-inconsistent/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">do mathematics in this setting</a>. If I'm not mistaken: one motivation is to talk about ""real numbers"" $\varepsilon$ with $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ <em>and</em> $\varepsilon = 0$.</li>

The asymptotes of a hyperbola in standard position are $\frac xa\pm \frac yb=0$, so they have direction vectors $$\left(\frac1a,\pm\frac1b\right)=\frac1a(1,0)\pm \frac1b(0,1).$$ This has an obvious generalization to a rotated hyperbola: if $\mathbf v_{\text{maj}}$ and $\mathbf v_{\text{min}}$ are unit vectors that give the major (transverse) and minor axes, respectively, with corresponding half-axis lengths $a$ and $b$, its asymptotes have direction vectors $\frac1a\mathbf v_{\text{maj}}\pm\frac1b\mathbf v_{\text{min}}$.

<p>We will prove that $P(0)\mid P(P(0))$ and $P(P(0))\mid P(0)$. From this we deduce that $P(P(0))=-P(0)$ and hence that $2P(0)\mid P(P(0))$, which is only possible if $P(0)=P(P(0))=0$.</p>

<p>Proof:</p>

<p>(1) With $q(x)=P(P(x))$ and $m=P(0), n=0$ you get that $$P(0)\mid P(P(0)).$$</p>

<p>(2) With $q=P(x),m=P(P(0)), n=0$ you $$P(P(0))\mid P(0).$$</p>

<p>(3) So $P(0)=\pm P(P(0))$. If $P(P(0))=P(0)$ then $0=P(P(P(0))=P(0)$. So assume $P(0)=-P(P(0))$.</p>

<p>(4) Now, letting $q(x)=P(x), m=P(0), n=P(P(0))=-P(0)$, you get $P(P(0))\equiv 0\pmod{2P(0)}.$</p>

<p>So $2P(0)\mid P(P(0))$ which contradicts $P(0)=\pm P(P(0))$ unless $P(0)= 0$.</p>

<p>This proof shows that this works for any function $f:\mathbb Z\to\mathbb Z$ such that $f(n)\equiv f(m)\pmod{n-m}$ for all integers $n,m$. There are uncountably many non-polynomial $f$, but there are also some polynomials with non-integer coefficients, like $f(x)=\frac{x^4+x^2}{2}$.</p>

<hr>

<p>So the short proof is (writing $P^2(x)=P(P(x)), P^3(x)=P(P(P(x)))$):</p>

<p>Assume $P^3(n)= n.$ Then:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}P^2(n)&amp;\equiv P(n)\equiv n\pmod{P(n)-n}\\
n= P^3(n)&amp;\equiv P(n)\pmod{P^2(n)-n}\\
n=P^3(n)&amp;\equiv P^2(n)\pmod{P^2(n)-P(n)}
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>The first two lines mean that $P^2(n)-n=\pm \left(P(n)-n\right).$</p>

<p>If $P^2(n)-n=P(n)-n$, then $P^2(n)=P(n)$ and hence $n=P(P^2(n))=P(P(n))=P(n).$</p>

<p>If $P^2(n)-n=n-P(n)$ then $P^2(n)-P(n)=2(n-P(n))$. So $$n=P(P^2(n))\equiv P(P(n))\pmod{2(n-P(n))}$$</p>

<p>So we get that $2(n-P(n))\mid (n-P^2(n))$. But $n-P^2(n)=\pm (n-P(n))$, contradiction, unless $n-P^2(n)=0$ and hence $P^2(n)=n$ and then $P(n)=P(P^2(n))=n$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A continuous function $f$ is analytic in an open domain $\Omega$ iff for every

  $\oint_\gamma f(z) d z = 0$. (A zero-homological loop is a loop with

<p>We can use this result to prove the desired property:</p>

<p>Continuity of the limit follows immediately from the uniform convergence. It remains to verify the key element of Cauchy's integral theorem, namely that all line integrals $\oint_\gamma f(z) dz = 0$ for the limit. 
Provided that $f_n\to f$ uniformly on every compact set, you have in particular $f_n\to f$ uniformly on every closed loop $\gamma$ (of finite length). Hence, for any zero-homological loop $\gamma$, and every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists some $N(\epsilon)\in \mathbb N$ such that $|f_n(z)-f(z)|&lt;\epsilon$ for all $n&gt;N(\epsilon)$. If $l(\gamma)$ denotes the length of $\gamma$, we then obtain
$$\left|\oint_\gamma f_n(z) dz - \oint_\gamma f(z) dz\right| \le l(\gamma)\epsilon,\quad\forall n&gt;N(\epsilon).$$
Since for every $n$, the integral $\oint_\gamma f_n(z) d z = 0$, this proves that $\oint_\gamma f(z) d z = 0$. Hence $f$ is analytic.</p>

<p>What you are interested in are called basins of attraction. For non-linear maps such as yours, they can be very complex and impossible to describe analytically. Without intensively investigating the situation myself, I can only give you a road map here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start by visualising the basins for some typical sets of parameters (which should be easy if I understood correctly that your state space is two-dimensional).
To do this, take a grid of points in your state space as initial conditions and colour them according to the fixed point they converge to.</p></li>

<li><p>Otherwise look for symmetries and other structures.

<p>Probably not. (Local) Lyapunov exponents tell you something about how quickly the state converges to a given fixed point within its vicinity. They cannot tell you <em>to which</em> fixed point the state converges (unless there is only one stable fixed point, in which case you can indeed find out using Lyapunov exponents). If your initial condition is near the border of basins of attraction, it is not in the vicinity of a fixed point (in the sense of the above statement).</p>
"
"2381251","2382637","<p>The confusion about ranges and zero reduced costs might have to do with the fact that, in a basic feasible solution, the values of the basic variables are uniquely determined by the values of the nonbasic variables. A nonzero reduced cost (on a nonbasic variable) tells you what would happen to the objective value if you forced that nonbasic variable to move off whichever bound (lower or upper) it currently sits on. So for Balaji (nonbasic on its lower bound), forcing a small investment in Balaji reduces the overall yield by 0.25% times that investment, while for Amar (nonbasic on its upper bound), forcing the solution to invest a little less in Amar would reduce yield by 0.50% times the reduction in Amar.</p>

<p>The values of basic variables, however, cannot be unilaterally adjusted, since they are completely determined by the values of the nonbasic variables. Perhaps a more accurate way to say this is that modifying the value of a basic variable requires modifying one or more nonbasic variables, and how you do that (combined with the reduced costs of the nonbasic variables you change) will determine the impact on the objective value.</p>

<p>The ranges tell you how much you can tweak any one objective coefficient while preserving optimality of the current basis. If you move an objective coefficient outside its range, a different corner of the feasible region may become optimal.</p>

<p>$-(h+x) (k+y)+(h+x)^2+(k+y)^2-3 (k+y)-1=0$</p>

<p>$x'^2-x' y'+y^2+x' (2 h-k)+y' (-h+2 k-3) +h^2-h k+k^2-3 k-1=0$ </p>

<p>To have no first degree terms we put $2h-k=0;\;-h+2 k-3=0$ which gives</p>

<p>$h=1;\;k=2$ and we plug these values in the previous equation</p>

<p>$x'^2 - x' y' + y'^2=4$</p>

<p>Now we want to get rid of the $x'y'$ term. To do so we have to rotate the axis using these equations</p>

<p>$\begin{aligned}x'&amp;=X\cos \theta -Y\sin \theta \\y'&amp;=X\sin \theta +Y\cos \theta \end{aligned}$</p>

<p>$(X \sin \theta+Y \cos \theta)^2-(X \cos \theta-Y \sin \theta) (X \sin \theta+Y \cos \theta)+(X \cos \theta-Y \sin \theta)^2=4$</p>

<p>as we want the term $XY$ off we set $\sin ^2\theta-\cos ^2\theta=0$</p>

<p>$\tan^2\theta=1\to \theta=\pm \dfrac{\pi}{4}$</p>

<p>if we want the major axis of the ellipse to be horizontal we choose $\theta=\dfrac{\pi}{4}$ and substitute this value in the last equation</p>

<p><strong>Generalities.</strong></p>

<p>Needless to say, marking out diagrams as commutative is <em>unusual</em>,
and---if done badly--<em>spoils them</em>.</p>

<p>The beauty and usefulness of commutative diagrams lies in that they contains hardly anything unnecessary.</p>

<p>There can be reasons for a symbolic notation though, in particular if one in a proof works with multiple diagrams, as mathematical objects in their own right, and finds accompanying words lying about somewhere in their periphery inadequately precise.</p>

<p>This is why I, personally, opted not to use any symbol within the diagram, neither the $\circlearrowleft$ kindly suggested by Osama Ghani, nor the $'''$ suggested by Arnaud D., nor the rotated # kindly suggested by Hans Lundmark, in the comments to the OP, nor even the identity 2-cell kindly suggested by Derek Elkins in one of the answers (in the example below, one would need more than one higher cell, which brings about new problems, while the intent is just to mark the diagram in its entirety as commutative). </p>

<p>In my work, I use <em>rectangular light-gray frames around the diagram</em>, annotated with the word ""commutes"", always at the bottom of the rectangle (see below). </p>

<p>For certain purposes, it still seems to me that 
a standardized notation for a diagram being commutative
is useful.</p>

<p>Please note that the below is unusual; I'm just adding it here to suggest
to others one of the infinitely-many solutions one can find to this notational problem.</p>

"2381388","2381533","<p>A space is first-countable if for each point $x$ there is a <em>single</em> sequence of neighborhoods such that <em>every</em> neighborhood of $x$ contains in some neighborhood in the sequence. Although for each specific neighborhood $V$ we can easily find a sequence with some element contained in $V$, we can't necessarily find a single sequence which works for every such neighborhood. (This is similar to the reason why the reals are uncountable, even though any <em>specific</em> real can be put on a list.)</p>

<p>This just shows why first-countability is not obviously trivial. It turns out that it is <em>really</em> nontrivial: there are lots of non-first-countable sequences. For example, consider the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_topology#Ordinals_as_topological_spaces"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">order topology on $\omega_1+1$</a>. Every open neighborhood of $\omega_1$ here contains a neighborhood of the form $(\alpha, \omega_1]$ for $\alpha$ a countable ordinal. But the supremum of countably many countable ordinals is countable, so for any sequence $U_i$ ($i\in\mathbb{N}$) of neighborhoods of $\omega_1$ contains a neighborhood of the form $(\beta, \omega_1]$ for some countable ordinal $\beta$. But then the neighborhood $(\beta+1, \omega_1]$ doesn't contain any of the neighborhoods $U_i$.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: here's a much better example, not requiring ordinals at all: the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocountable_topology"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>cocountable topology</em></a> on any uncountable set $S$. For any sequence of neighborhoods $(U_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ of a point $x$, the intersection $\bigcap U_i$ is again cocountable, and hence uncountable (since $S$ is uncountable). Pick $s\in \bigcap U_i$, $s\not=x$; then $(\bigcap U_i)\setminus\{s\}$ is a neighborhood of $x$ not containing any of the $U_i$s.</p>

<hr>

<p>Interestingly, first countability is <strong>nontrivially nontrivial</strong>: showing that a space is not first countable generally requires using a principle of the form ""the union of countably many ""small"" sets is ""small,"""" and such principles are generally not true without some amount of the axiom of choice. For instance, it is consistent with ZF that <em>every infinite set is a countable union of sets of strictly smaller cardinality</em>! In fact, I don't offhand know of an example of a space which is provably non-first-countable <em>in ZF alone</em> (and I've now <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2381554/universal-first-countability-in-zf"">asked a question about this</a>).</p>

<p>(Incidentally, there are some neat examples if choice fails sufficiently badly - e.g. the cofinite topology on any <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_set"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">amorphous set</a>, if such a set exists.)</p>

"2381396","2381878","<p>Note that by definition, the maps $X,Y \rightrightarrows X \sqcup_f Y$ are induced by the inclusions $X,Y \rightrightarrows X \sqcup Y$. Suppose you have another solution $(Z,u,v)$, and a (continuous) map $\phi:X \sqcup_f Y \to Z$ making the diagram commute. Composing with the quotient map we get a map $\bar\phi : X \sqcup Y \to Z$ or, equivalently, two maps $X,Y \rightrightarrows Z$. Commutativity of the diagram then dictates that $\bar\phi (x) = u(x)$ and $\bar\phi(y) = v(y)$ for all $x \in X, y \in Y$. This means that the only way to define $\phi$ is to let $\phi([x]) = u(x)$ and $\phi([y]) = v(y)$. Moreover, since $u \circ i = v  \circ f$, we have $$\phi([f(a)]) = v(a) = u(a) = \phi([a])$$ for any $a \in A$, so $\phi$ is a well-defined continuous map.</p>

"2381523","2381532","<p>When it talks about an algorithm X, it is talking about a set of instructions ... for example, when I tell you how to do addition of two numbers, I might say 'start with the two digits on the right, add those up, and write down the sum and the possibly carry-over.

<p>Now, notice that these instructions are expressed in English, but I could have used any other language as well. Computers of course have their own language too, usually binary. Anyway, it is <em>some</em> language we ar using, and the computer program is a string of symbols following that language.</p>

<p>So, don't think of X as the actual 'running program', but rather as the <em>description</em> of what needs to be done: a program is just a description of a process, and only when the program is being executed will that process actually take place.</p>

<p>In sum: the algorithm/computer program X is a string of characters that happens to be a set of instructions.</p>

<p>But the 'data set' D is <em>any</em> kind of string of symbols. That of course does not mean that D is a set of instructions, but it <em>could</em> be.  Hence, you can use X as a specific kind of data set; a data set that happens to be a computer program.</p>

"2381531","2381614","<p>Lets start with your second question.</p>

<p>Let $\mathfrak{F}(\Bbb R)$ be the collection of smooth functions $\Bbb R\to\Bbb
R$ and let $Q$ be a $n\times n$ matrix over $\mathfrak{F}(\Bbb R)$. This means
that $Q$ is of the form
$$
Q=
\begin{bmatrix}
q_{11} &amp; q_{12} &amp; \dotsb &amp; q_{1n} \\
q_{21} &amp; q_{22} &amp; \dotsb &amp; q_{2n} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
q_{n1} &amp; q_{n2} &amp; \dotsb &amp; q_{nn} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
where each $q_{ij}$ is a smooth function $q_{ij}:\Bbb R\to\Bbb R$.</p>

<p>Next, let $\{y_1,\dotsc,y_n\}$ be functions $\Bbb R\to\Bbb R$ satisfying
$Y^\prime=QY$ where
$$
Y=
\begin{bmatrix}
  y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_n
\end{bmatrix}\tag{1}
$$
Note that the equation $Y^\prime=QY$ gives the system of first-order
differential equations
$$
\begin{array}{rcrcrcrcrcrcrcrcrc}
  y_1^\prime &amp; = &amp; q_{11}\cdot y_1 &amp; + &amp; q_{12} \cdot y_2 &amp; + &amp; \dotsb &amp; + &amp; q_{1n}\cdot y_n \\
  y_2^\prime &amp; = &amp; q_{21}\cdot y_1 &amp; + &amp; q_{22} \cdot y_2 &amp; + &amp; \dotsb &amp; + &amp; q_{2n}\cdot y_n \\
  \vdots     &amp;   &amp; \vdots          &amp;   &amp; \vdots           &amp;   &amp; \ddots &amp;   &amp; \vdots          \\

\end{array}\tag{$\ast$}
$$
So, solving $Y^\prime=QY$ is equivalent to solving the system ($\ast$).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example.</strong> Let $Q=\begin{bmatrix}  x^2 &amp; e^x \\  4   &amp; \sin(x)\end{bmatrix}$. Then $Y^\prime=QY$ is the system of first-order differential equations $$\begin{array}{rcrcrcrcrcrcrcrcrc}  y_1^\prime &amp; = &amp; x^2\cdot y_1 &amp; + &amp; e^x\cdot y_2 \\  y_2^\prime &amp; = &amp; 4\cdot y_1  &amp; + &amp; \sin(x)\cdot y_2\end{array}$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, note that any given $Y$ of the form (1) is an element of the vector space
$\mathfrak{F}(\Bbb R)^n$. Let $S_Q$ be the collection of all $Y$ satisfying
$Y^\prime=QY$. We wish to show that $S_Q$ is a subspace of $\mathfrak{F}(\Bbb
R)^n$. To do so, we may use the one-step vector subspace test, noting that
$S_Q\neq\varnothing$ since $\mathbf{0}\in S_Q$. To use the one-step vector
subspace test, suppose that $Y,Z\in S_Q$ and that $\lambda\in\Bbb R$. Then
$$
(Y+\lambda\cdot Z)^\prime
= Y^\prime + \lambda\cdot Z^\prime
= QY + \lambda\cdot QZ
= Q(Y+\lambda\cdot Z)
$$
Hence $Y+\lambda\cdot Z\in S_Q$, proving that $S_Q$ is indeed a subspace of
$\mathfrak{F}(\Bbb R)^n$.</p>

<p>So, to summarize, the answers to your questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>$S_Q$ is <em>not</em> ``a subspace of the matrix $Q$'' (this language does not make sense). Rather, $S_Q$ is a subspace of the vector space $\mathfrak{F}(\Bbb R)^n$.</p></li>

"2381543","2382356","<p>Qiaochu Yuan has brought me to the solution of the paradox, I believe. </p>

<p>Consider the category of finite dimensional $G$-graded $k$-vector spaces. It is a $k$-linear, semisimple category with finitely many simple objects, which correspond to the elements of the group. Call them $k_g, g \in G$. Their tensor product is then $k_{g_1} \otimes k_{g_2} = k_{g_1 g_2}$.</p>

<p>To choose an associator for the whole category, it suffices to define it on the simple objects. This means we have isomorphisms $\alpha_{g_1,g_2,g_3}\colon (k_{g_1} \otimes k_{g_2}) \otimes k_{g_3} \to k_{g_1} \otimes (k_{g_2} \otimes k_{g_3})$ satisfying the pentagon axiom. Since $k_{g_1 g_2 g_3}$ is a simple object, these correspond to invertible numbers in $k$ which we will call $\omega(g_1,g_2,g_3)$, and the pentagon axiom turns out to be the multiplicative cocycle condition:</p>

<p>$$ \omega(g_1, g_2, g_3) \omega(g_1, g_2 g_3, g_4) \omega(g_2, g_3, g_4) = \omega(g_1 g_2, g_3, g_4) \omega(g_1, g_2, g_3 g_4) $$</p>

<p>Furthermore, a monoidal equivalence between two copies of the same category with different associators is given by a coboundary between the two cocycles, so indeed any category of $G$-graded vector spaces is given by a class in $H^3(G,k^*)$.</p>

<p>Now let us deform the associator. Replace $k$ by $k[\varepsilon]/\varepsilon^2$. An associator is now given by $\omega(g_1, g_2, g_3) + \varepsilon \omega'(g_1, g_2, g_3)$, where $\omega$ satisfies the cocycle condition as before, and $\omega'$ satisfies the <em>additive</em> cocycle condition:</p>

<p>$$ \omega'(g_1, g_2, g_3) + \omega'(g_1, g_2 g_3, g_4) + \omega'(g_2, g_3, g_4) = \omega'(g_1 g_2, g_3, g_4) + \omega'(g_1, g_2, g_3 g_4) $$</p>

<p>It is, in a sense, the derivative of the multiplicative cocycle condition.</p>

<p>Up to equivalence of categories, we have in particular $[\omega] \in H^3(G, k^*)$ and $[\omega'] \in H^3(G, k)$, in the latter considering the underlying additive group of $k$. $H^3(G, k)$ classifies in which directions we can ""continuously deform"" the associator.</p>

<p>Now for $k$ having characteristic 0 (or in general, as Qiaochu says, if the characteristic of $k$ doesn't divide the order of the group), $H^3(G,k) = 0$, which means that we cannot deform the associator at all. In particular, there are only finitely many different possible associators. This is a special case of a statement called ""Ocneanu rigidity"".</p>

<p>So $n, n-1, n+2$ must have no other factors than $2$ or $3$.  A and there must be exactly one power of $3$ as a factor.  So the only possible odd numbers among $n, n-1,$ and $n-2$ (of which there must be at least one) allowed would be $3$ or $1$.  Assuming $n\ge 3$ and natural (<em>Is</em> that an assumption?) we must have at least one odd and it must be greater than one. So we can only have one odd and it must equal $3$.</p>

<p>Furthermore the two other terms must be even and they must powers of $2$.   </p>

<p>Hence the only possible odd among $n, n-1, n-2$ is equal to $3$.   $n, n-2$ have the same parity so they must be even and $n-1$ must be odd and $n-1 =3$. </p>

<p>This is good as $n=4$ and $n-2 = 2$  are powers of $2$ (and that is the only two powers of $2$ where $2^k - 2^m = 2$).  $\frac {2*3*4}6 = 4 = 2^2 = 2^{4-2}$ so this is the only acceptable solution.</p>

Then $X$ is not first-countable at $\infty$.  Indeed, suppose $(U_n)$ is a local base at $\infty$.  For each $n$, let $j_n$ be the least $j$ such that $(n,j)\in U_n$ (since $U_n$ is nonempty and open, it must contain $(n,j)$ for all but finitely many $j$).  Now let $$U=\{\infty\}\cup\{(n,j)\in\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}:j&gt;j_n\}.$$ Then $U$ is an open neighborhood of $\infty$.

<p>Let $\alpha$ be the corresponding primitive element, i.e. a zero of $p(x)$. Let's use the basis $\mathcal{B}=\{1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\ldots,\alpha^{p-1}\}$ for $GF(2^p)$ over $GF(2)$. Let $\beta=\alpha^d$. </p>

<li>Because $m(x)$ is irreducible of degree $p$, we know that $m_0=m_p=1$. Using this and the result of the earlier calculation we can write the sum
$$S=\sum_{i=0}^pm_i\beta^i$$ in terms of $\mathcal{B}$. We treat the coefficients $m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_{p-1}$ as unknown variables. Observe that $S$ is linear in all these variables.</li>

<p>So, essentially, the text is saying that the amount of ""effort"" $z_i$ exerted by a firm is the number of draws they make from a random variable distributed by $F$. Accordingly, the result of their draws -- the ""innovation"", as that text has it -- is the maximum of their draws. Therefore, the random variable we are interested in is the maximum of $z_i$ draws, or in other words, the $z_i^{th}$ order statistic of $z_i$ independent draws from a $F$-distributed random variable. Let's call this random variable $Y$, so that $Y$ is the maximum of $z_i$ draws from another random variable, $X$, where $X\sim F$.</p>

<p>As they say in the text, the cdf of $Y$ is given by $F^{z_i}(x)$. Of course, the pdf of this random variable is the derivative of its cdf. Since
$$ \frac d{dx}F^{z_i}(x) = z_i F^{z_i-1}(x)\frac d{dx} F(x)=z_i F^{z_i-1}(x)f(x)$$
we have that this is the pdf of $Y$. So to answer your question, $z_iF^{z_i-1}(x)f(x)$ is the pdf of the random variable $Y$, where $Y$ itself the maximum of $z_i$ independent draws from the random variable $X$.</p>

This equation is now an ODE in a real variable. Hence, you can use Matlab to solve it. Since
$$
s = \frac{t}{3 + 2\mathrm{i}}

$$
you obtain your solution $y(t)$ by
$$
y(t) = w(s) = w(\frac{t}{3 + 2\mathrm{i}})

Even when the horse runs at 256 m/s, and assuming the distance between the bell and ears is, say, 3 meters, then it will only take a fraction of a second for the sounds to reach the horse's ears, and hence the horse will have traveled less than 256 meters before hearing the sound .. so yeah, 400km is <strong>plenty</strong> to reach 512 m/s</p>

"2381629","2381861","<p>If you mean proper isotopies (An isotopy of $D^2$ in $B^4$ which restricts to an isotopy of $S^1$ inside $S^3$), the answer is no. Take for instance the flat disk bounding the unknot (or more generally any doubly-slice disk) and connect sum any non-trivial 2-knot (an embedded $S^2$ in $S^4$ not smoothly isotopic to a longitudinal $S^2$). If this disk was isotopic to the flat disk, then it's easy to construct an isotopy from this 2-knot to the standard longitudinal $S^2$. The first example of such a 2-knot is due to E.

"2381664","2381750","<p>In the question as asked, your mistake is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if the logic has two non-isomorphic models, then this is rather trivial, or? For then just choose a proposition which is true in one model, but false in the other...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just because $\mathcal{A}\not\cong\mathcal{B}$ does <strong>not</strong> mean that there is a sentence true in one and false in the other! There are non-isomorphic structures which <em>are</em> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_equivalence"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">elementarily equivalent</a>. One easy way to see this is just by a cardinality argument: in a given language $L$, there are only $2^{\vert L\vert+{\aleph_0}}$-many sets of sentences in the language $L$ but a proper class of structures, so we have to be able to find non-isomorphic structures with the same theory. More satisfyingly, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactness_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">compactness theorem</a> (or rather, its corollary the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6wenheim%E2%80%93Skolem_theorem#Upward_part"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">upwards Lowenheim-Skolem theorem</a>) tells us that for any structure $\mathcal{A}$ there is a nonisomorphic, elementarily equivalent structure $\mathcal{B}$. And in particular, if $T$ is a complete theory with an infinite model, then $T$ has lots of nonisomorphic but elementarily equivalent models (since any two models of $T$ are elementarily equivalent since $T$ is complete). <em>(Exercise: ""has non-elementarily-equivalent models"" is <strong>exactly the same as</strong> ""is incomplete."")</em></p>

<p>So Godel's incompleteness theorem says <strong>far more</strong> than just that there are non-isomorphic models of any ""reasonable"" theory of arithmetic: it says that no reasonable theory of arithmetic even pins down the true natural numbers up to elementary equivalence!</p>

<p>It's worth considering, at this point, some examples of <em>complete</em> theories.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The theory of dense linear orders without endpoints is computably (indeed, finitely) axiomatizable and is complete; this is a standard exercise in most first-semester logic classes. </p></li>
<li><p>A more interesting example is the following. If we consider the structure $(\mathbb{N}; +)$, it turns out that Godel <em>fails</em>: the theory <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Presburger arithmetic</a> is complete (it axiomatizes $Th(\mathbb{N}; +)$). It's also decidable, since Presburger arithmetic is computably axiomatized.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, it turns out that the theory of real closed fields is complete (and computably axiomatized); this is due to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_closed_field#Model_theory:_decidability_and_quantifier_elimination"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tarski</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>You also asked about <em>truth</em> (although truth doesn't even show up in your statement of Godel's theorem). The issue here - as in <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2346305/the-entscheidungsproblem-and-the-notion-of-decidability-in-first-order-logic"">your other question</a> - is that you are <em>conflating two notions of truth</em>. The truthy version of Godel's incompleteness theorem says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For any ""reasonable"" theory $T$, there is a true sentence $\varphi$ which is not provable in $T$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>""True"" here means ""true <em>in the structure $(\mathbb{N}; +, \times)$</em>;"" this has nothing to do with truth <em>in all models of $T$</em>. A better statement of the ""truthy"" incompleteness theory is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For any ""reasonable"" theory $T$, there is a sentence $\varphi$ such that $\varphi$ is not provable in $T$ but $(\mathbb{N}; +,\times)\models\varphi$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes it very clear what's going on, and why Godel's completeness theorem is irrelevant. Again, it boils down to the fact that any reasonable theory of arithmetic $T$ will have lots of non-elementarily-equivalent models; the sentence $\varphi$ above is <em>not true in all of them</em>, hence (by Completeness) <em>not provable in $T$</em>, but <em>is true in the standard model</em>.</p>

<p>(Keep in mind that ""reasonable"" here means, among other things, ""computably axiomatizable""; of course the set of all sentences true in $(\mathbb{N}; +,\times)$ is a complete theory, but Incompleteness doesn't apply to it since it's not computably axiomatizable.)</p>

on a boundary.</p>

<p>Just looking at the histogram (or at a table of interval boundaries, midpoints,

observations, all we can say about the median is that it falls in the
interval $(94.5, 104.5)$ with midpoint $99.5$ and frequency $6.$ This
interval is called the <em>median interval.</em></p>

<p>In practice, grouped data tables and histograms are used mainly for samples

<p>A favorite exercise in elementary statistics books is to try to approximate the
exact value of the median from a histogram or from grouped data. Doing so
requires one to make the assumption (seldom true) that the observations within the median
interval are evenly spaced (or uniformly distributed).</p>

<p>One formula for approximating the exact median $H$ is</p>

<p>$$ H = L + \frac{w}{f_m}(.5n - cf_b),$$</p>

<p>where $L = 94.5$ is the lower limit of the median interval, $f_m = 6$ is the
frequency of the median interval, $cf_b = 9$ is the number of observations
in intervals below the median interval, $w = 10$ is the (common) interval
width, and $n = 25$ is the total sample size. This kind of formula is
sometimes called an 'interpolation' formula. </p>

<p>For our data,</p>

<p>$$ H = 94.5 + (10/6)(25/2 - 9) = 100.3333.$$</p>

<p>This procedure is seldom used in serious statistical analysis, and formulas
for it can differ a bit from one textbook to another. I do not know the formula in
your book, or why you wonder about a distinction between even and odd
sample sizes $n$. </p>

<p>I hope this answer is helpful. If you are using a different formula to
approximate the median, or if you have further questions, please leave me a Comment and edit your
Question to be a little more specific. Then perhaps one of us can be of
further help. </p>

<p><em>Notes</em>: (1) The 25 observations are simulated from $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu = 100,\,\sigma = 15)$ and rounded to integers. So the median of the <em>population</em> from which
the data were drawn is $\eta = 100.$ (2) It is not usually a good idea to
'group' datasets with $n$ as small as 25, or to make histograms of such
small datasets. I chose this particular illustration because I thought it
would make the application of the interpolation formula easy to follow.</p>

Similarly $v_n$ touches $d(v_n)$ of the pairs $(v_{i-1}, v_i)$ (here 'touches' means $v_n$ is adjacent to $v_{i-1}$). Thus $d(v_1) + d(v_n) \geq n$ pairs are touched by $v_1$ or $v_n$.

"2381767","2381829","<p>I'm not sure this is quite what you're looking for, since it's really just a proof that a finitely generated algebra over a Jacobson ring is Jacobson, specialized to the case of $\mathbb{Z}$.  But here goes.  The key tool is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artin%E2%80%93Tate_lemma"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Artin-Tate lemma</a> (you can use Noether normalization instead, but Artin-Tate gives what I would consider a more elementary argument).</p>

<p>First, let us prove that any field $K$ which is finitely generated as a ring is a finite field.  Let $k$ be the prime subfield of $K$.  Since $K$ is finitely generated as a $k$-algebra, it suffices to show $K$ has positive characteristic and is finite over $k$.  Let $B\subset K$ be a transcendence basis and note that $K$ is algebraic and hence finite over $k(B)$.  By the Artin-Tate lemma applied to the $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras $k(B)\subseteq K$, $k(B)$ is finitely generated as a ring.  This implies $B=\emptyset$ (any finitely generated subring of $k(B)$ has only finitely many irreducible polynomials which are factors of denominators of its elements, but there are infinitely many different irreducible polynomials in $k[B]$ if $B$ is nonempty).  Moreover, since $\mathbb{Q}$ is not a finitely generated ring, $k$ must have positive characteristic.  Thus $K$ is algebraic over $k=\mathbb{F}_p$ for some $p$ and hence is a finite field.</p>

<p>Now suppose $R$ is a finitely generated domain and $f\in R$ is nonzero.  The ring $S=R[f^{-1}]$ is then also a finitely generated domain, and so it has a maximal ideal $M$.  I claim that $M\cap R$ is a maximal ideal of $R$, and thus there exists a maximal ideal of $R$ which does not contain $f$.</p>

<p>To prove this, observe that field $S/M$ is finitely generated as a ring, and hence finite.  But $R/(M\cap R)$ is naturally a subring of $S/M$, and any subring of a finite field is a field.  Thus $R/(M\cap R)$ is a field, so $M\cap R$ is maximal.</p>

"2381791","2381848","<p>Instead of thinking of it as each man gets a bunch of shillings, puts them in his pocket, then takes out a bunch of shillings from his pocket and gives them to the next man; think of it as a man with $k$ shillings gets a basket containing $w$ shillings.  The man adds a shilling to it and passes the basket on.  The man now has $k -1$ shillings and the basket now has $w + 1$ shillings in it.</p>

<p>Let it start with there being $m$ men, the last man is the poorest with $k$ shillings (and the first man is the richest with $m+k -1$ shillings).  The basket starts with $0$ in it.  But each man puts in $1$ shilling so at the end of a ""circuit"" (when it gets to the last man) every man has put in a shilling so the basket has $m$ shillings and each man is a shilling poorer.  The last/poorest man has $k -1$ shilling and the first richest has $m+k -2$.</p>

<p>Each round the basket grows by $m$ and each man (in particular the last man) gets poorer by $1$.  So after $j$ rounds the basket with have $m*j$ shillings and the last man will have $k - j$ shillings.  </p>

<p>At the end of  $k$ rounds the last man puts his last shilling in, and the basket has $mk$ shillings.  He passes it on for the $k+1$ round.  At the end of <em>that</em> round, the last man can't do anything and the whole thing ends.  The basket has $km + (m-1)$ shillings as everybody but the last man put a last shilling in.</p>

<p>The last man breaks the basket open and keeps the $km + m -1$ shillings.  The man before him has no shillings as that second man had only one more than the last man.  The first man started with $m+k -1$ shillings and he put in $k+1$ shillings in so the first man has $m-2$ shillings.</p>

<p>We are told a neighbor has $4$ times as much as another, but each neighbor has $1$ more that the neighbor ahead of him.  Except the last man and the first man.</p>

<p>So either the first man has $4$ times as much as the last man and $m-2 = 4(km + m - 1$ or the last man has $4$ times as mch as the first and $km + m -1 = 4(m-2)$.</p>

<p>So $k$ is presumably positive it must be the latter.  And </p>

<p>$km + m - 1 = 4(m-2)$</p>

<p>$(k+1)m -1 = 4m - 8$</p>

<p>$(k-3)m = -7$ </p>

<p>$(3-k)m = 7$</p>

<p>Either $3-k = 7$ and $m =1$ Which is ... silly... as we know there were more than one man.  Or $3-k = 1; k = 2$ and $m=7$.</p>

<p>So:  Beginning:  First man has $8$ shillings and last man has $2$. Basket has $0$ shillings.</p>

<p>End of first round:  Basket has $7$ shillings.  First man has $7$ and last an has $2$.</p>

<p>End of second round:  Basket has $14$ shilings. First man has $6$ and last has $0$.</p>

<p>Final round:  First man has $5$ shillings.  Men $1-6$ have added shillings so the basket has $20$ shillings in it.  It gets passed to the last man who is supposed to add a shilling to it but he can't because he doesn't have any. </p>

<p>So the last man keeps the basket.  The last man has $20$ shillings.  The first man has $5$.  (And men $2-6$ have $4,3,2,1,0$ respectively.</p>

"2381822","2381876","<p>Using the continuity of $L$, pick $\delta &gt; 0$ such that $|L(f)|&lt;1$ whenever $d(f,0)&lt;\delta$. One sufficient condition for $d(f,0)&lt;\delta$ is that $f$ satisfy the following property:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Property $P_{\delta}$.</strong> The support of $f$ is contained in an interval of length $&lt;\delta$. To be precise, there exists an interval $I\subseteq [0,1]$ of length $&lt;\delta$ such that $ \{x : f(x) \neq 0 \} \subseteq I $.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If $f$ has this property, then so is <em>any</em> scalar multiple of $f$, hence</p>

<p>$$ |L(f)| = \frac{1}{n}|L(nf)| \leq \frac{1}{n} $$</p>

<p>and we have $L(f)=0$ by letting $n\to\infty$.</p>

<p>Now the key idea is that any continuous function $f$ can be uniformly approximated by linear combinations of functions having poperty $P_{\delta}$.</p>

<p>For instance, for each $n$ satisfying $n&gt;2/\delta$, we notice that the linear interpolation $f_n$ of points $(\frac{k}{n}, f(\frac{k}{n}))$ for $k = 0, \cdots, n$ can be written by</p>

<p>$$f_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)\varphi_{n,k}(x), \qquad \varphi_{n,k}(x) := \max\left\{0, 1-n\left|x-\frac{k}{n}\right|\right\}.$$</p>

<p>Since each $\varphi_{n,k}$ is supported on the interval $[\frac{k-1}{n}, \frac{k+1}{n}]$ whose length is $=\frac{2}{n} &lt; \delta$, it has property $P_{\delta}$ and hence $L(\varphi_{n,k})=0$. So it follows that $L(f_n) = 0$. On the other hand, we can easily check that $f_n \to f$ uniformly and hence $f_n \to f$ under the metric $d$. So we have $L(f)=0$ as desired.</p>

<p>We could have as a convention that we always go from left to right, always.  So the expression $a + b*c + d*e + f$ would now mean $((a+b)*c + d)*e + f$ and to write the expression we meant we'd have to writh $a + (b*c) + (d*e) + f$.</p>

<p>This is perfectly acceptable.</p>

<p>However given that we have the distributive law that $a(b+c) = (ab) + (ac)$ there is an incentive to view $a*c + b*c$ so $(a*c) + (b*c) = (a+b)*c$ rather than as $(a*c + b)*c = a*c^2 + (b*c)$.  Our convention is consistent, less capricious, and usefl and insightful.</p>

<p>We deduce that $f(0)=1$. This and the second condition suggests that perhaps $f(n)=n+1$ holds for all $n$. Indeed, the function $n\mapsto n+1$ satisfies all of the above conditions, so is a candidate for the solution. We would like to prove that this is the only such function.</p>

<p>Let's prove this by induction. Suppose $f(m)=m+1$ holds for all $0\leqslant m&lt;n$. In particular, $n=f(n-1)$. Thus, $$f(n)=f(0+f(n-1))=f(0)+n-1+1=f(0)+n=n+1.$$</p>

It is immediate from this definition that every $h \in H$ sends $e_0$ to some point in $ p^{-1}(b_0)$, and with more work (see Hatcher pages 70-71), one can verify that this correspondence between the elements of $H$ and the points in $p^{-1}(b_0)$ is one-to-one and onto. Having thus identified the set $p^{-1}(b_0)$ with the group $H$, it is now meaningful to ask whether or not your map $g : \pi_1(B, b_0) \to p^{-1}(b_0)$ is a group isomorphism, and the answer is yes.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, details of this are provided in Hatcher on pages 70-71, though you may as well prove it yourself. You already know that $g$ is a bijection, so it only remains to check that $g$ is a group homomorphism, and this follows by an argument using uniqueness of path lifts. A few months ago, I wrote <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2206920/e-oversetp-longrightarrowx-covering-space-connected-and-locally-path-con/2206983#2206983"">an answer</a> about a more general version of this result - see the fourth bullet point in that answer for a hint on how to complete the proof.</p>

"2381942","2381955","<p>You're not going to get much in the way of ""efficient"" here. Usually the point of these proofs is to demonstrate that you can spell out all the little steps in a cohesive manner. You need to learn to walk before you learn to run.</p>

<p>There are significant problems with your proof. Specifically, you're confusing the sum of two linear functions with summing their arguments (i.e. the vectors you substitute into them).</p>

<p>Let's start by explicitly defining the sum and scalar product of linear transformations. Suppose $T_1, T_2 : V \rightarrow W$ are linear, and $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$ (the common scalar field for $V$ and $W$, usually $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ in undergraduate courses). Then,</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
T_1 + T_2 &amp;: V \rightarrow W : v \mapsto T_1(v) + T_2(v) \\
\lambda T_1 &amp;: V \rightarrow W : v \mapsto \lambda T_1(v).
\end{align*}</p>

<p>Notated more simply, we have for all $v \in V$,</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
(T_1 + T_2)(v) = T_1(v) + T_2(v) \\
(\lambda T_1)(v) = \lambda T_1(v).
\end{align*}</p>

<p>What you have to realise here is that the $+$ between $T_1$ and $T_2$ is a different operation to the $+$ between $T_1(v)$ and $T_2(v)$. The first plus is the addition operation that we're defining; the one that takes two linear maps $T_1, T_2$ and produces a third linear map $T_1 + T_2$. The second plus is the addition in $W$, between two vectors in $W$: $T_1(v)$ and $T_2(v)$. They are different operations on different vector spaces.</p>

<p>So, let's try proving, say, distributivity of scalar multiplication over addition. Suppose $T_1, T_2,$ and $\lambda$ are as above. We wish to show that $\lambda(T_1 + T_2) = \lambda T_1 + \lambda T_2$. In order to prove this, we must show that both functions, on the left and right, do the same thing to every vector $v$. So, we must show that, for all $v \in V$,</p>

<p>$$(\lambda(T_1 + T_2))(v) = (\lambda T_1 + \lambda T_2)(v)$$</p>

<p>Using only the definition of the sum of linear functions as described above, we have,</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
(\lambda(T_1 + T_2))(v) &amp;= \lambda((T_1 + T_2)(v)) &amp; \text{(Definition of scalar multiplication on $L$)} \\
&amp;= \lambda(T_1(v) + T_2(v)) &amp; \text{(Definition of addition on $L$)} \\
&amp;= \lambda T_1(v) + \lambda T_2(v) &amp; \text{(Distributivity in $W$)} \\
(\lambda T_1 + \lambda T_2)(v) &amp;= (\lambda T_1)(v) + (\lambda T_2)(v) &amp; \text{(Definition of addition on $L$)} \\
&amp;= \lambda T_1(v) + \lambda T_2(v) &amp; \text{(Definition of scalar multiplication on $L$)}
\end{align*}
Therefore, $(\lambda(T_1 + T_2))(v) = (\lambda T_1 + \lambda T_2)(v)$ as needed, so $\lambda(T_1 + T_2) = \lambda T_1 + \lambda T_2$.</p>

<p>When showing closure of addition, you'll need to show that $T_1 + T_2$ is a linear function from $V$ to $W$. That is, you'll need to use the definition of $T_1 + T_2$ to show it's linear, specifically for all $v, w \in V$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$,</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
(T_1 + T_2)(v + w) &amp;= (T_1 + T_2)(v) + (T_1 + T_2)(w) \\
(T_1 + T_2)(\lambda v) &amp;= \lambda(T_1 + T_2)(v)
\end{align*}</p>

<p>Similarly for scalar multiplication. You should only need the definitions of addition in $L$ and basic properties of $V$ and $W$ guaranteed by $V$ and $W$ being vector spaces.</p>

<p>Also think about the additive identity and additive inverses. The additive identity must be a linear transformation from $V$ to $W$. What does it do to an arbitrary vector $v \in V$? These are things you need to make clear!</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>EDIT: There are still issues with the proof. Let's take a look at your proof of associativity, for example. Associativity of addition states that $(u + v) + w = u + (v + w)$, where $u, v, w$ are elements of the proposed vector space. The proposed vector space you're dealing with is $L$. You should be showing this is true for three linear transformations, $T_1, T_2, T_3$ from $V$ to $W$. You need to prove that
$$(T_1 + T_2) + T_3 = T_1 + (T_2 + T_3).$$
In order to do this, you'll need to show, for an arbitrary $v \in V$, that
$$((T_1 + T_2) + T_3)(v) = (T_1 + (T_2 + T_3))(v)$$
You should be able to show this only with the definition of addition on $L$ (as I described above) and associativity on $W$. I advise writing out reasons for the steps, much like I did with the distributivity. Let me get you started with the first step:
$$((T_1 + T_2) + T_3)(v) = (T_1 + T_2)(v) + T_3(v) \ \ldots \ \text{Definition of addition on }L$$
With all of these axioms that require showing an equality of vectors (everything except closure and possibly additive identity and inverses), you'll only need one vector $v \in V$ to show equality (as you just need to show that when each transformation is applied to a given vector, it returns the same result). As soon as you introduce $u$ or $w$, you're proving the wrong thing.</p>

<p>I'll get to closure in a moment, but let's look at the additive identity. Remember, you want to find an element of $L$, a <strong>linear transformation</strong> from $V$ to $W$, that adds to other transformations in $L$ without changing them. I'll do the additive identity:</p>

<p>Let $\mathbf{0} : V \rightarrow W : v \mapsto 0_W$, where $0_W \in W$ is the additive identity of $W$. So $\mathbf{0}$ is a constant function, taking every $v \in V$ and returning $0_W$. We should probably verify that this function I've made up is really in $L$. It obviously maps from $V$ to $W$, but is it linear? Let's show that now.</p>

<p>Suppose $u, v \in V$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$. Then
$$\mathbf{0}(u + v)= 0_W = 0_W + 0_W =\mathbf{0}(u) + \mathbf{0}(v)$$
$$\mathbf{0}(\lambda v) = 0_W = \lambda 0_W = \lambda \mathbf{0}(v).$$
Therefore, by definition, $\mathbf{0}$ is linear, and thus belongs to $L$.</p>

<p>Let's show $\mathbf{0}$ is indeed the additive identity. So, we must show $T + \mathbf{0} = T$. Again, we show this is true by applying both sides to an arbitrary vector $v \in V$, and verifying we get the same thing. We have,
\begin{align*}
(T + \mathbf{0})(v) &amp;= T(v) + \mathbf{0}(v) &amp; \text{(Definition of addition on $L$)} \\
&amp;= T(v) + 0_W &amp; \text{(Definition of $\mathbf{0}$)} \\
&amp;= T(v) &amp; \text{(Additive identity of $W$)}
\end{align*}
Thus, as required, $T + \mathbf{0} = T$. I'm hoping this is starting to click. We are only really interested in the addition and scalar multiplication operations on $L$, between linear transformations. We do need addition and scalar multiplication on $W$, but only to show the properties we want of addition and scalar multiplication on $L$.</p>

<p>Finally, I think I'll go through closure, as it's a bit of an exception. I'll do closure under scalar multiplication. Basically, given any $T \in L$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$, we need to show that $\lambda T$ is linear. Suppose $u, v \in V$ and $\mu \in \mathbb{F}$. We have,
\begin{align*}
(\lambda T)(u + v) &amp;= \lambda T(u + v) &amp; \text{(Definition of scalar multiplication on $L$)} \\
&amp;= \lambda (T(u) + T(v)) &amp; \text{($T$ is linear)} \\
&amp;= \lambda T(u) + \lambda T(v) &amp; \text{(Distributivity in $W$)} \\
&amp;= (\lambda T)(u) + (\lambda T)(v) &amp; \text{(Definition of scalar multiplication on $L$)} \\
(\lambda T)(\mu v) &amp;= \lambda T(\mu v) &amp; \text{(Definition of scalar multiplication on $L$)} \\
&amp;= \lambda (\mu T(v)) &amp; \text{($T$ is linear)} \\
&amp;= (\lambda \mu) T(v) &amp; \text{(Associativity of scalar multiplication on $W$)} \\
&amp;= (\mu \lambda) T(v) &amp; \text{(Commutativity of multiplication on $\mathbb{F}$)} \\
&amp;= \mu (\lambda T(v)) &amp; \text{(Associativity of scalar multiplication on $W$)} \\
&amp;= \mu (\lambda T)(v) &amp; \text{(Definition of scalar multiplication on $L$)}
\end{align*}</p>

<p>These two properties mean that $\lambda T$ is linear, hence $\lambda T \in L$ as required.</p>

"2382072","2382091","<p>A function $f$ from a set $X$ (called <strong>domain</strong>) into a set $Y$ (called <strong>codomain</strong>) is a rule that assigns every $x$ in $X$ to a unique $y$ in $Y$, where $y$ is usually denoted by $f(x)$. The function $f$ has an inverse if and only if it makes sense to reverse the rule on $f$. That is, if and only if for every $y$ in $Y$ there is a unique $x$ in $X$ such that $f(x)=y$. With this, there are two ways that the function can fail to have an inverse.</p>

<p>1) The function $f$ may map multiple elements of the domain to the same point in the codomain. As an example, suppose $f:\{0,1\}\to\{a\}$ is defined by $f(0)=f(1)=a$. This function doesn't have an inverse because defining $g:\{a\}\to\{0,1\}$ by $g(a)=0$ and $g(a)=1$ is not a valid function. Indeed,
 this $g$ does not satisfy the uniqueness part of the definition (or, as you may be familiar with, the ""vertical line test""). This doesn't work precisely because $f$ is not <strong>injective</strong>.</p>

<p>2) The function $f$ may not map to all elements of the codomain, so there is no way to define an inverse on the entire codomain. As an example, suppose $f:\{0\}\to\{a,b\}$ is defined by $f(0)=a$. This function does not have an inverse because defining $g:\{a,b\}\to\{0\}$ by $g(a)=0$ is not a valid function. To see this, note that $b$ is an element of the domain of $g$ that is left unassigned. This doesn't work precisely because $f$ is not <strong>surjective</strong>.</p>

<p>In fact, these are exactly the only two reasons that $f$ can fail to have an inverse. One can prove that $f$ has an inverse if and only if it is both injective and surjective.</p>

$$
\underset{x}{\text{minimize}}\ ||y-Ax||_2^2+\lambda||x||_0
$$
However, when using the $0$-""norm"", the problem is not convex and we have to solve a combinatorial problem. To avoids this, the $0$-""norm"" is often approximated with the $1$-norm, resulting in the Lasso problem you describe. As the $1$-norm is the closest convex approximation to the $0$-""norm"", we can solve the Lasso very efficiently using the powerful tools from convex optimization. </p>

<p>Now one could ask if there is a better approximation. To find a ""better"" approximation (closer to the original $0$-""norm""), it seems that we have to sacrifice the convexity of the problem. However, if we use $\sum_{i=1}^N \log(1+\frac{|x_i|}{\xi'})$ we can actually get a ""better"" approximation but still utilize convexity. To solve the optimization problem with the $\log$ penalty, we need to implement an iterative approach. Let's start with solving the Lasso, yielding the solution $x^{(0)}$. Next, we linearize the $\log$-penalty around the latest value (using the first Taylor terms)
$$
\arg \min_{u_{i}}\ \sum_{i=1}^N\left(\log(1+\frac{u^{(0)}_i}{\xi'})+\frac{1}{\xi'+u_i^{(0)}}(u_i-u_i^{(0)})\right)
$$
which yields
$$
\arg \min\ \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{|x_i|}{\xi'+|x_i^{(0)}|}
$$
(here I used $u_i$ just to avoid the case when $x_i=0$ in $|x_i|$. One has to do some more work but this works as intuition). So now we have a iterative approach: Solve the weighted lasso using the latest solution, update the weights $\left(\frac{1}{\xi'+|x_i^{(k)}|}\right)$, solve again. Here $(\cdot)^{(k)}$ denotes the $k$th iteration. In each iteration, the problem is convex. Here, the constant $\xi'$ is added to avoid numerical problems when $x_i=0$. </p>

<p>An onther intuition can be found by realizing that when $k$ tends to infinity we get $|x_i^{k+1}-x_i^{k}|\rightarrow 0$ which yields
$$
\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{|x_i^{k+1}|}{\xi'+|x_i^{(k)}|}\approx ||x||_0

"2382205","2383822","<p>What you are trying to show is not correct. To see this, assume that your claim holds.</p>

<p>Let $(g_\ell)_{\ell \in \Bbb{N}}$ be an arbitrary sequence with $\| g_\ell \|_{L^1} = 1$ and $g_\ell \geq 0$. For $n \in \Bbb{N}$, define
$$
\phi_n := g_\ell \text{ for the unique } \ell \in \Bbb{N} \text{ with } 2^\ell -1 \leq n &lt; 2^{\ell+1} -1.
$$
By the assumed claim of yours, we get because of $\phi_n \geq 0$ for all $n$ that
\begin{align*}
\infty
 &gt; \sup_{n \in \Bbb{N}} \frac{s_n}{n}
&amp;\geq \sup_{\ell \in \Bbb{N}} \frac{\phi_{1} + \dots + \phi_{2^{\ell + 1} - 2}}{2^{\ell + 1} - 2} \\
&amp;\geq \sup_{\ell \in \Bbb{N}} \frac{\phi_{2^\ell - 1} + \dots + \phi_{2^{\ell + 1} - 2}}{2^{\ell + 1} - 2} \\
&amp;= g_\ell \cdot \frac{2^{\ell + 1} - 2 - (2^{\ell} - 1) + 1}{2^{\ell + 1} - 2} \\
&amp;\geq g_\ell \cdot \frac{2^\ell}{2^{\ell + 1} - 2}
\geq \frac{g_\ell}{2},
\end{align*}
for arbitrary $\ell \in \Bbb{N}$.</p>

<p>Thus, we have shown that if your claim was true, then the following holds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For each sequence $(g_\ell)_\ell$ with $g_\ell \geq 0$ and $\| g_\ell \|_{L^1} = 1$, we have $\sup_{\ell \in \Bbb{N}} g_\ell &lt; \infty$ almost everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this is clearly false: As a counterexample, let $X_n \overset{iid}{\sim} U([0,1])$, i.e., the $X_n$ are (jointly) independent, and each $X_n$ is uniformly distributed in $[0,1]$. Next, set $Y_n := \sqrt{n} \cdot 1_{X_n \leq 1/\sqrt{n}}$. Note that $Y_n \geq 0$ and $\| Y_n \|_{L^1} = 1$. But we have
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \Bbb{P} ( Y_n \geq \sqrt{n}) = \sum_n \Bbb{P} (X_n \leq 1/\sqrt{n}) = \sum_n \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} = \infty,
$$
so that the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel%E2%80%93Cantelli_lemma#Converse_result"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Second part of the Borel-Cantelli Lemma"">second part of the Borel-Cantelli Lemma</a> shows
$$
\Bbb{P} ( Y_n \geq \sqrt{n} \text{ infinitely often}) = 1.
$$
Therefore, we actually have $\sup_n Y_n = \infty$ almost surely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All in all, we have thus shown that the claim you wanted to prove is false.</p>

"2382210","2382350","<p>For the purposes of this answer, let superscript denote compositions. You want to evaluate:
$$y=\lim_{n \to \infty} \cos^n{(x)}$$
$$y=\lim_{n \to \infty} \cos{\left(\cos^{n-1}{(x)}\right)}$$
$n-1$ goes to infinity the same as $n$
$$y=\lim_{n \to \infty} \cos^{n-1}{(x)}$$
$$y=\cos{y}$$
The unique solution to this equation is called the Dottie number $=D \approx 0.739085$. Now to prove convergence for all initial real $a_0$. After one composition, $-1 \leq a_n \leq 1$. Now that the sequence is bounded, we want to prove that it is either monotonically increasing or decreasing. If it is, it must converge to something within the interval. This cannot be done for the sequence as it is because it alternates about $D$. The operation must be changed from $\left (a_{n+1}=\cos{a_n}\right)$ to $\left(a_{n+1}=\cos{\left(\cos{a_n}\right)}\right)$
We want to prove that:
$$a_n \leq a_{n+1} \leq D \quad \text{if} \quad a_n \leq D$$
$$a_n \geq a_{n+1} \geq D \quad \text{if} \quad a_n \geq D$$
$$\text{Define } f(x)=\cos{\left(\cos{x}\right)}-x \quad\quad f(D)=0$$
Since $D$ is the only zero of $f(x)$, $f(x)$ is continuous, and the end behaviors $\infty, -\infty$:
$$f(x) \geq 0 \text{ when } x \leq D$$
$$f(x) \leq 0 \text{ when } x \geq D$$
The relationship between adjacent terms in the sequence is verified. Next, we must show that the sequence stays on the same side of $D$. Observe that after two compositions, $a_n$ is bounded: $0 \leq \cos{1} \leq a_n \leq 1 \quad$ since $\quad 1 \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$
$$\text{Define } f(x)=\cos{\left(\cos{x}\right)}-D \quad\quad f(D)=0$$
$$f'(x)=\sin{x}\sin{\left(\cos{x}\right)}$$
$$f'(D)=\sin^2{D}$$
Since the derivative is positive at $D$, $f(x)$ is continuous, and $D$ is the only zero of $f(x)$ in the interval $[0, 1]$:
$$f(x) \geq 0 \text{ when } D \leq x \leq 1$$
$$f(x) \leq 0 \text{ when } 0 \leq x \leq D$$
Therefore, the two original inequalities are proven, and the sequence converges to $D$.</p>

"2382213","2382561","<p>Suppose that $X$ is your random variable. Then the moment generating function is $M_X(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{tX}]$, where $t$ is a real number, though not necessarily <em>any</em> real number (you might only be allowed to pick $t$ within a certain range).</p>

<p>There is no non-mathematical interpretation as to what a moment generating function is. It is purely a mathematical concept (it is related to Fourier transforms). That said, moment generating functions are useful since a random variable with some distribution has a unique moment generating function, and a moment generating function maps to some unique distribution. Thus, given a moment generating function, it is possible to identify the distribution it is associated with.</p>

<p>For example, suppose $X$ is a coin flip with probability $p$ of appearing heads, and equals 1 when heads, 0 when tails. The moment generating function can easily be calculated:</p>

<p>$$M_X(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{tX}] = p e^{t \times 1} + (1 - p) e^{t \times 0} = p e^t + (1 - p)$$</p>

<p>I could even generalize this and say that when the coin lands heads-up, $X = A$ and when it lands tails-up, $X = B$ (instead of always 1 or 0) and the moment generating function would be:</p>

<p>$$M_X(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{tX}] = p e^{At} + (1 - p) e^{Bt}$$</p>

<p>Suppose then I were told that the moment generating function for $Y$ is $M_Y(t) = \frac{1}{2} e^t + \frac{1}{2}$. A model of a fair coin that yields $Y = 1$ when the coin lands heads-up and $Y = 0$ when the coin lands tails-up would fit this moment generating function, so that <em>must</em> be the distribution of $Y$.</p>

<p>Moment generating functions are used extensively since they allow for easily computing the distribution of transformations of random variables. Suppose I wanted to identify the distribution of the sum of two independent random variables $X$ and $Y$; this could be a painful computation, but thanks to moment generating functions, I can say:</p>

<p>$$M_{X + Y}(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{t(X + Y)}] = \mathbb{E}[e^{tX}e^{tY}] = \mathbb{E}[e^{tX}] \mathbb{E}[e^{tY}] = M_X(t) M_Y(t)$$</p>

<p>That is, just multiply the random variables moment generating functions together and you get the moment generating function for the distribution of their sum, which you can use to identify their distribution. (Exercise: Look up the moment generating function of Normally-distributed random variables with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, and use this technique to find the distribution of $X + Y$ when $X \sim N(1, 1)$ and $Y \sim N(2, 3)$, with $X$ and $Y$ independent.)</p>

<p>Moment generating functions get their name from the fact that they can be used to compute the expected values of moments of random variables (where the $n$th moment of a random variable $X$ is $\mathbb{E}[X^n]$). For example, to get the 1st moment, first take the derivative of the moment generating function:</p>

<p>$$M'_X(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\mathbb{E}[e^{tX}] = \mathbb{E}[\frac{d}{dt}e^{tX}] = \mathbb{E}[Xe^{tX}]$$</p>

<p>Set $t = 0$ to get $M'_X(0)=\mathbb{E}[X]$. Take more derivatives to get more moments. (Exercise: Use the moment generating function of a standard Normal random variable to compute $\mathbb{E}[X]$, $\mathbb{E}[X^2]$, $\mathbb{E}[X^3]$, and $\mathbb{E}[X^4]$.)</p>

<p>Moment generating functions have a lot of useful properties but I'll let you look those up. Often moment generating functions for common distributions are distributed in tables, already computed for you. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment-generating_function#Examples"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia article</a> has one.</p>

"2382230","2382265","<p>I will assume that you are only interested in real values. That is,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Assumption.</strong> $A$, $B$, $C$, $\alpha $ are all in $\mathbb{R}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In particular,</p>

<p>$$f(x) = A\cosh x + B\sinh x + C$$</p>

<p>is a real-valued function on $\mathbb{R}$. Then this setting allows us to avoid some pesky issue regarding the branch cut of the complex logarithm. So let us compute the integral.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Let $p, q$ be zeros of the quadratic polynomial $\frac{A+B}{2}t^2 + Ct + \frac{A-B}{2}$. In other words, they satisfy the identity  $ \frac{A+B}{2}t^2 + Ct + \frac{A-B}{2} = \frac{A+B}{2}(t - p)(t - q)$. Then plugging $t = e^{\alpha x}$, we find that</p>

<p>$$f(x) = \frac{A+B}{2} e^{\alpha x} (1-pe^{-\alpha x}) (1-qe^{-\alpha x}) $$</p>

<p>In particular, we have</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
\log |f(x)|
= \log\left|\frac{A+B}{2}\right| + \alpha x + \log |1-pe^{-\alpha x}| + \log |1-qe^{-\alpha x}|. \tag{1}
\end{align*}</p>

<p>(Here, I am assuming that you are only interested in the region where $f(x) &gt; 0$. Then taking absolute values causes no harm.)</p></li>
<li><p>In order to integrate the above equation, we need a special function called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylogarithm#Dilogarithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>dilogarithm</em></a>. It is the function which is denoted by $\operatorname{Li}_2$ and is defined by</p>

<p>$$ \operatorname{Li}_2(z) = -\int_{0}^{z} \frac{\log(1-t)}{t} \, dt = -\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\log(1-zu)}{u} \, du, \quad z \in \mathbb{C}\setminus[1,\infty). $$</p>

<p>(Here, the first integral is taken along the line segment joining $0$ and $z$. The equivalence of two integrals can be shown by the substitution $t = zu$.) So $\operatorname{Li}_2(z)$ is not differentiable along the branch cut $[1,\infty)$. On the other hand, its real part behaves much better since</p>

<p>$$ \operatorname{Re}\operatorname{Li}_2(z)
= -\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\log|1-zu|}{u} \, du \tag{2}$$</p>

<p>A bit of complex analysis tells that both sides of $\text{(2)}$, understood as function of real variables $x$ and $y$ (with $z = x+iy$), extends to a smooth on all of $\mathbb{R}^2\setminus\{(1,0)\}$. As a useful consequences, for any $0 &lt; a &lt; b$ we have</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
-\int_{a}^{b} \frac{\log|1-zu|}{u} \, du

&amp;= \operatorname{Re}\operatorname{Li}_2(bz) - \operatorname{Re}\operatorname{Li}_2(az).
\end{align*}</p>

<p>(Here, we utilized the substitution $u = bv$ and $u = aw$ for respective terms.) This is useful when computing some indefinite integrals to come.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the previous computation, we can integrate $\text{(1)}$. Indeed, let us substitute $u=e^{-\alpha x}$. Then</p>

<p>$$\int \log|1 - p e^{-\alpha x}| \, dx
= -\frac{1}{\alpha}\int \frac{\log|1 - pu|}{u} \, du
= \frac{1}{\alpha}\operatorname{Re}\operatorname{Li}_2(pu) + \text{constant} $$</p>

<p>This remains true if we replace $p$ by $q$. Therefore we get</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>\begin{align*}
&amp;\int \log|f(x)| \, dx \\
&amp;\hspace{1em}= x\log\left|\frac{A+B}{2}\right| + \frac{\alpha x^2}{2} + \frac{1}{\alpha}\operatorname{Re}\operatorname{Li}_2(pe^{-\alpha x}) + \frac{1}{\alpha}\operatorname{Re}\operatorname{Li}_2(qe^{-\alpha x}) + \text{constant}.

"2382245","2383285","<h2>Hyperbolic case</h2>

<p>First off, the combinatorics of tilings in hyperbolic geometry will also affect the size of the cells. So I'd guess a hyperbolic bee might be more interested in having approximately bee-sized cells, even if it means using slightly more wax. But that's a question for hyperbolic biology, so back to the geometry.</p>

<p>The way you quoted it, you'd be minimizing line length per number, which has a length unit remaining. Thus the optimum is not invariant under scale. But the video mentions that the cells should have unit area. So if you had a honeycomb with cells of area 9 square length units, you'd scale it down by 3 length units and then start measuring edge lengths. Or in other words, you are minimizing perimeter divided by the square root of the enclosed area. You could as well square that and minimize squared perimeter divided by enclosed area. If you care about absolute numbers, particularly comparing them with the limit process described in the video, you might want to divide the perimeter by two since each wall is shared by two adjacent cells, so the contribution per cell is just half of that. But for the sake of finding the optimum it does not matter.</p>

<p>Let's consider a regular hyperbolic tiling of $n$-gons, $m$ of them meeting at each corner, with $\frac1m+\frac1n&lt;\frac12$. What's its edge length? The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_law_of_cosines"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hyperbolic law of cosines</a> for curvature $-1$ states</p>

<p>$$\cosh a=\frac{\cos\alpha+\cos\beta\cos\gamma}{\sin\beta\sin\gamma}$$</p>

<p>Now consider a right triangle covering $1/2n$ of your cell. It has $\alpha=\frac\pi n$ at the center, $\beta=\frac\pi m$ at the vertex and $\gamma=\frac\pi 2$ at the center of the edge of the cell. This leads to</p>

<p>$$a=\operatorname{arcosh}\frac{\cos\frac\pi n}{\sin\frac\pi m}$$</p>

<p>The area of that triangle is equal to the angle defect:</p>

<p>$$A=\pi-\frac\pi n-\frac\pi m-\frac\pi 2=\pi\left(\frac12-\frac1n-\frac1m\right)$$</p>

<p>Now the whole cell is composed of $2n$ such triangles, so the total perimeter is $2na$ and the total area is $2nA$. Thus the number to optimize is</p>

<p>$$\frac{(2na)^2}{2nA}=\frac{2n\left(\operatorname{arcosh}\frac{\cos\frac\pi n}{\sin\frac\pi m}\right)^2}{\pi\left(\frac12-\frac1n-\frac1m\right)}$$</p>

<p>Now you can try this out for some values of $m$ and $n$:</p>

<p>$$\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}
n\backslash m &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\\hline

\end{array}$$</p>

<p>It turns out the optimum is the 7,3 tiling: regular heptagons, three of them meeting at each vertex. This is also the tiling with the smallest cells, so if the cells aren't too small for our hyperbolic bees, they should pick this one. For comparison, the Euclidean hexagon is at $8\sqrt3\approx13.8564$, the Euclidean square at $16$. So that hyperbolic heptagonal tiling is still better than the Euclidean 4,4.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ADqyA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ADqyA.png"" alt=""Rendering of the regular 7,3 tiling""></a></p>

<h2>Elliptic case</h2>

<p>You also asked for the elliptic case, and there the approach is pretty much the same. Use the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_law_of_cosines"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spherical law of cosines</a> and the surplus angle as a measure of area and you get</p>

<p>\begin{gather*}
a = \arccos\frac{\cos\alpha-\cos\beta\cos\gamma}{\sin\beta\sin\gamma}
= \arccos\frac{\cos\frac\pi n}{\sin\frac\pi m}
\\
A = \frac\pi m+\frac\pi n+\frac\pi 2-\pi = \pi\left(\frac1m+\frac1n-\frac12\right)
\\
\frac{(2na)^2}{2nA}=\frac{2n\left(\arccos\frac{\cos\frac\pi n}{\sin\frac\pi m}\right)^2}{\pi\left(\frac1n+\frac1m-\frac12\right)}
\end{gather*}</p>

<p>But here the degenerate situations win out. For $m=2$ you get two hemispheres no matter the value of $n$, which is already better than any $m&gt;2$. For $m=1$ you get a division by zero since $\sin\frac\pi m=0$ in that case. But you can well imagine that considering the whole sphere a single cell is optimal as it uses no walls at all.</p>

"2382274","2382323","<p>Given a collection of objects $C$ (usually a set in this context), there is an ""obvious"" category that has objects $C$: it's the category whose only morphisms are the identity morphisms with obvious composition, which is often called the discrete category associated to $C$.</p>

<p>In the answer to your previous question, this category was denoted $DC$. It's obvious that any map $f: C\to E$ can be thought of as a functor $Df: DC \to DE$ that sends the object $c\in C$ to $f(c)$, and the arrow $id_c$ to $id_{f(c)}$. Since in both $DC, DE$ there are only trivial compositions, these things fill out to be a functor $D: Set \to \mathbf{Cat}$, where $\mathbf{Cat}$ is the category of small categories and functors between them. This is the ""discrete category"" functor, because it sends sets to the associated discrete category.</p>

<p>So in your previous question, the notation $Set^S$ can be equivalently seen as : the category of functors $DS \to Set$ where $DS$ is as above, or as the category of $S$-indexed families. Generally, for sets $A,B$, $B^A$ can be seen as the category of functors $DA\to DB$ because such a functor is precisely a map $f: A\to B$, i.e. the assignement $D: Hom_{Set}(A,B) \to Hom_{\mathbf{Cat}}(DA,DB)$ is full (and faithful): $D$ is a full (and faithful) functor. </p>

<p>What's interesting is that this last analogy between $B^A$ and $Hom_{\mathbf{Cat}}(DA,DB)$, is that $D(B^A) \cong [DA,DB]$ where $[DA,DB]$ is the functor category. That's because if you have $Df, Dg: DA\to DB$ two functors, and $\tau: Df\to Dg$ a natural transformation, then for any $a\in Ob(DA)=A$, $\tau_a: f(a) \to g(a)$ is a morphism in $DB$, which implies $g(a)= f(a)$. Therefore if there is a natural transformation (or a $[DA,DB]$-morphism) $Df \to Dg$, we get $f=g$ and this natural transformation is the identity, hence $Df= Dg$, that is, $[DA,DB]$ is the discrete category associated to $B^A$.</p>

"2382276","2382281","<p>First thing about exponential function is, its values/graph approximates zero, so the whole graph is lifted by two (that's the $+2$ there).</p>

<p>Once we subtract the 2, we see that the graph is going through one at point $x=-4$, but should go at zero, so the graph is moved by 4 to the left, hence the $+4$, (becuase if $x=-4$, then $x+4=0$). And we move it to the right.</p>

<p>The last thing (or two) we notice is the translated graph going through point $(-1,3)$ and $(-2,9)$, therefore we need to find base a, for which this is true, and that is $1/3$. </p>

W_M(T) = \{\langle M PT y , y \rangle : y \in Im(M); ||y||_M = 1\} = W^{Im(M)}_M (PT_{Im(M)})

<p>Neumann series, Behind the Scenes (read; Behind the Proof);</p>

<p>Suppose you have some operator $A$ such that $\|A\|&lt;1$. It's spectrum is contained in the ball of radius $1$. It is actually a coroallry of the Neumann series theorem which we are discussing, but let's take that as a fact, for we try to realize what is happening <em>behind the proof</em>. When I picture the spectrum I would think about something like this:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sh6l3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sh6l3.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
The spectrum of $A$ is that odd shape, it is contained in a circle of radius $r&lt;1$ about the origin (this is another not-so-easy fact, there are several theorems that show that, for instance Neumann series again. The formula for the spectral radius shows it too). Note I drew the spectrum $\sigma(A)$ as continuous shape, and that it contains $0$ (so $A$ is not invertible), but this has nothing to do with the rest of the intuitive geometric feeling i'm trying to communicate. You make take it to be discrete or whatever, but it must be in that ball of radius $r&lt;1$.</p>

<p>Now look at $I-A$, the spectrum then looks like <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PKqcA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PKqcA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

"2382341","2382616","<p>Your equation for the volume is correct. However, actually plotting the volume is somewhat more complicated. Specifically, in 3D space you need a matrix of terms for each of $x, y$, and $z$. This is most easily visualized in a vertical arrangement, with rotation about the $z$-axis. So imagine the line $r=f(z)$. Then take a vector $\theta\in[0,2\pi]$ with however many points you wish and for each value of $z$ find $X=r\cos\theta$, $Y=r\sin\theta$. These are matrices of the size of $r$ by the size of $\theta$. The $Z$ matrix is just a uniformly spaced matrix for all the $z$ and $\theta$ values.

"2382342","2382665","<p>with 1), why do you say $(p_n)_n$ has no  convergent subsequence? It <em>is</em> true but needs a small lemma: a convergent sequence is bounded, plus the fact that every subsequence of $(p_n)$ is also unbounded.</p>

<p>With 2: Let $x \in \overline{A}$. Then $x \in \overline{A}$ means there is a sequence $(a_n)_n$ from $A$ such that $a_n \to x$ (this holds in all metric spaces, and indeed it suffices to pick $a_n \in B(x,\frac{1}{n})$ for this).</p>

<p>So there is an $a \in A$ and a subsequence $a_{n_k} \to a$ by assumption on $A$.
But any subsequence of a convergent sequence converges to the same limit, so $a_{n_k} \to x$. As limits of (sub)sequences are unique: $x =a \in A$, so $A$ is closed.</p>

"2382474","2382664","<p>There are a lot of incorrect ideas here.  First, antiderivatives of $f$ aren't even in a cohomology class at all.  A cohomology class consists of a coset of the set of closed forms by the vector subspace of exact forms.  In particular, for a form (in this case, a $0$-form) to be in a cohomology class, it must be a closed form!  In order for a function $F$ to be a closed $0$-form, its derivative must be $0$.  So the antiderivatives $F$ and $G$ themselves are not elements of any cohomology class (unless $f=0$), though the differences $F-G$ are.</p>

<p>As for whether the differences $F-G$ are all elements of the same cohomology class, the answer is no.  Two closed $0$-forms are in the same cohomology class iff they differ by an exact $0$-form.  By definition, an exact $0$-form is the differential of a $(-1)$-form.  But there is no such thing as a $(-1)$-form (or rather, we formally say the vector space of $(-1)$-forms is the trivial vector space), so the only exact $0$-form is $0$.  So two closed $0$-forms are in the same cohomology class only if they are equal.  This renders your question (2) rather trivial, since any degree $0$ cohomology class has only one element.</p>

<p>Also, it is not correct that $F-G$ is constant: it is only <em>locally</em> constant.  If $A$ is disconnected, $F-G$ can take different values on different connected components.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the correct story.  The set of closed $0$-forms consists of the set of all smooth functions whose derivative vanishes.  These are exactly the locally constant functions.  Since the only exact $0$-form is $0$, the closed $0$-forms are the same thing as the $0$th de Rham cohomology.</p>

<p>On the other hand, given any smooth function $f$ which has an antiderivative $F$, you can find another antiderivative $G$ of $f$ by adding any locally constant function to $F$, and all other antiderivatives of $f$ can be found in this way.  That is, the ambiguity in defining ""the"" antiderivative of $f$ is determined by the set of all locally constant functions, aka the $0$th de Rham cohomology.</p>

<p>As for your third question, is this formulation in terms of de Rham cohomology enlightening?  Maybe, maybe not.  As I see it, its value is that it gives directions to generalize the phenomenon of non-uniqueness of antiderivatives.  For instance, if instead of an open subset $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ you had an arbitrary manifold, the correct generalization would be to talk about antiderivatives of $1$-forms on your manifold, not antiderivatives of functions (the differential of a function on a manifold is a $1$-form, not another function).</p>

<p>And of course, you can also consider de Rham cohomology in higher dimensions as another generalization.  Note though that there is an important difference in higher dimensions: exact forms no longer have to be trivial, so closed forms (which, as the forms with differential $0$, literally capture the non-uniqueness of ""antiderivatives"") are no longer the same as cohomology classes.  Instead, cohomology classes capture the non-uniqueness of antiderivatives modulo the ""trivial"" reasons that antiderivatives should not be unique (those coming from exact forms).  Another way to think of it is that they capture the part of the non-uniqueness of antiderivatives that comes from the global topology of your manifold, rather than just from the formal local properties of your manifold.  In the case of dimension $0$, the global topology in question is how many connected components your manifold has, which determines how many locally constant functions there are.</p>

"2382504","2382511","<p>There is not enough information.  It could be anywhere from $0$ to $100\%$.

The remaining seven Joe's all have black hair.  The remaining seven blond people are named Bob.</p>

<p>Now... here are two possible scenarios, each unable to be distinguished from the details you have given so far:</p>

<p>This would lead to a probability that a blonde Joe is a rockstar as being $0\%$.</p>

<p>Of course, the specific numbers could be literally anywhere between those.

"2382589","2382756","<p>If you are vetting a random number generator (RNG), this chi-squared test 
is one useful criterion. However, there are some additional considerations:</p>

<p>(a) The chi-squared <em>statistic</em> is based on integer counts, and thus is
discrete. This means the P-values from the test will not be <em>exactly</em>
uniformly distributed in $(0,1).$ [The approximating chi-squared <em>distribution</em>
is continuous, but it is the statistic that matters.] Even though
the P-values are are not exactly $\mathsf{Unif}(0,1),$ they will take 
many values throughout $(0,1)$ if the RNG is working as advertised.</p>

<p>(b) Even if the RNG is is 'good', the P-value will be below 0.05 in about 5%
of your runs. Thus it is necessary to do many runs (as you have done) before
drawing a conclusion about the RNG. You should be suspicious of an RNG that
consistently gives P-values below 0.05.</p>

<p>(c) Perhaps surprisingly, you should also be suspicious of an RNG that
consistently gives P-values <em>above</em> 0.95 (corresponding to very <em>low</em> chi-squared values). A frequent flaw in 'bad' RNGs is that their behavior is 'too regular'.
A chi-squared statistic of 0 arises from <em>perfect fit</em> of observed counts to
expected counts. Analogously, you should be suspicious if someone claims
to have rolled a fair die 600 times, obtaining exactly 100 instances each
of faces 1 through 6. The result seems ""too good to be true.""</p>

<p><em>More generally,</em> thoroughly vetting an RNG requires subjecting it to a large
number of simulation tasks to see that it gets the same answers predicted
by theory. Some of the tests need to be multivariate, because it is possible
for an RNG to make a suitable almost uniform-looking histogram in one dimension
and yet put all its points on only a few hyperplanes of an $n$-dimensional
unit hypercube. [The ""Mersenne-Twister,"" the default RNG in R statistical software, has been vetted up to $n = 623$ dimensions. If you have access to R,
type <code>help .Random.seed</code> and <code>help runif</code> in the Session window for
explanatory pages.]</p>

<p>There are curated 'batteries' of test problems for RNGs. Problems are chosen because they are
notoriously difficult for RNGs that are only 'pretty good' to simulate correctly. One useful package
of such problems is Marsaglia's ""Die Hard,"" which you can read about on
several Internet pages.</p>

"2382596","2382614","<p>The author is arguing as follows: for any <em>fixed</em> $n$-tuple $(x^{*1},\ldots,x^{*n})$ of covectors, the function $$(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \mapsto \Omega(x^{*1},\ldots,x^{*n};x_1,\ldots,x_n)$$
is multilinear and skew-symmetric (i.e., it is a determinant function). Therefore by the uniqueness theorem of determinant functions, there exists a scalar $\Phi(x^{*1},\ldots,x^{*n})$ (depending on our fixed $n$-tuple) such that our determinant function is just a multiple of the fixed non-trivial determinant function $\Delta$, i.e., $$\Omega(x^{*1},\ldots,x^{*n};x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \Phi(x^{*1},\ldots,x^{*n}) \Delta(x_1,\ldots,x_n).$$</p>

<p>Stated differently: the set of all determinant functions on $E$ actually forms a vector space. (If you're familiar with exterior algebra, it is the space $(\Lambda ^n E)^*$.) The uniqueness theorem above amounts to the statement that this space is one-dimensional, spanned by $\Delta$. Therefore there is an isomorphism $\phi:(\Lambda ^n E)^* \to K$ characterized by $\phi(\Delta) = 1$, where $K$ denotes the base field. The author is implicitly defining a map which I will call $\psi:(E^*)^n  \to (\Lambda ^n E)^*$, by the rule $$\psi(x^{*1},\ldots,x^{*n}) = [(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \mapsto \Omega(x^{*1},\ldots,x^{*n};x_1,\ldots,x_n)].$$

"2382611","2382718","<p>Here’s another technique, which even though of limited utility, works beautifully and quickly when it works at all.</p>

<p>You are asking for roots of $X^4=-1$ over $\Bbb F_5$, and the degree of the extension that one of them (and hence all) generates. But these are the primitive eighth roots of unity, and you need to know the degree of the smallest extension of $\Bbb F_5$ that contains these. In other words, you are looking for the first $n$ such that $8|(5^n-1)$.

"
"2382617","2382639","<p>(a) is true.  Let's see why using the definition of lim inf.</p>

<p>Let $\epsilon &gt; 0$.  $\liminf \limits_{n \to \infty} x_{n} = a$ means $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty} g_{n} = a$, where $g_{n} := \inf \limits_{k \geq n} \{x_{k}\}$, right?  So, for some point $N$ in the sequence, we have all later points (i.e., for all $n \geq N$) satisfying $g_{n} \in (a - \epsilon, a + \epsilon)$.  That means $\inf \limits_{k \geq n}\{x_{k}\} \in (a - \epsilon, a + \epsilon)$ <strong>for all $n \geq N$</strong>.  Ok, so let's look at $N$ first.  $g_{N} \in (a - \epsilon, a + \epsilon)$ implies $\inf \limits_{k \geq N} \{x_{k}\} \in (a - \epsilon, a + \epsilon)$, and so by properties of infimum, we can find some point in the sequence $x_{n_{1}}$, with $n_{1} \geq N$.  Now, since $n_{1} \geq N$, that means $g_{n_{1}} \in (a - \epsilon, a + \epsilon)$.  By the same argument as above, we can find some $n_{2} &gt; n_{1}$ so that $x_{n_{2}} \in (a - \epsilon, a + \epsilon)$.  Then we can find $n_{3} &gt; n_{2}$, and so on.  In particular, we have a subsequence $x_{n_{k}}$ satisfying $x_{n_{k}} &lt; a + \epsilon$, which is what we wanted to find, so (a) is true.</p>

<hr>

<p>(b) is false, as Daniel Schepler noted in the comments.  </p>

<p>To show this using the definitions, note that $a - \epsilon &lt; a$, right?

So, after some $N$, all of the $g_{n}$ are within $\frac{\epsilon}{2}$-distance of $a$ by definition of limit.  In particular, for some $N$, $a - \frac{\epsilon}{2} &lt; g_{N} = \inf \limits_{k \geq N} \{x_{k}\}$, implying that $a - \frac{\epsilon}{2} \leq x_{k}$ for all $k \geq N$.  This shows that you can't find a subsequence less than $a - \epsilon$.</p>

"2382638","2382692","<p>The answer is no in general. You are assuming that $A\ll \lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure on the time axis. If the Lebesgue measure also dominates $\langle M,M\rangle$, so that

then yes. </p>

<p>The following can be helpful. If there is an equivalent local martingale measure (ELMM) for $X$ then 
necessarily $A\ll \langle M,M\rangle$. If ELMM exists then necessarily 
$B \ll \langle M,M\rangle$. If additionally we know that \eqref{1} holds then you get what you wanted.</p>

"2382654","2383514","<p>Not really. First, note that each functional $\psi $ on $C_b (X) $ restricts to a bounded functional on $C_0 (X) $, so that there is a (unique!) measure (regular, complex valued)  with $\psi (f) =\int f d\mu $ for $ f \in C_0$.</p>

<p>The problem is that even though both sides of the equality make sense for $f \in C_b $, it is not necessarily true for all such $f $. As an example, consider the (closed) subspace
$$
L := \{f : \Bbb {R} \to \Bbb {C} \,:\, \lim_{|x|\to \infty} f (x) \text { exists}\},
$$
and define a  bounded functional on $L $ by $\psi (f) =\lim_{|x|\to\infty} f (x) $. Since $\psi $ vanishes on $C_0$, the measure from above is $\mu =0$, although $\psi (x\mapsto 1) =1 \neq 0$.</p>

<p>Essentially, the problem is that $C_b / C_0$ is quite large in general.</p>

<p>Note though that the theorem is true if $X $ is compact, simply because in this case, $C_0 = C_b $.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Related to your additional question: One can identify the set of functionals on $C_b (X)$ with the set of regular complex measures on a suitable compactification of $X$. Indeed, if $\beta X$ denotes the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93%C4%8Cech_compactification"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Stone–Čech compactification"">Stone–Čech compactification</a> of $X$, then each $f \in C_b (X)$ extends uniquely to a map $\tilde{f} \in C(\beta X) = C_0 (\beta X)$ (note that $f(X)$ is a bounded subset of $\Bbb{C}$, and thus contained in a compact set; in fact, this shows $\| \tilde{f} \|_\sup = \|f \|_\sup$).</p>

<p>Let $\iota : X \to \beta X$ be the embedding of $X$ into $\beta X$ and note that $\iota$ is a homeomorphism of $X$ onto its range in $\beta X$, since $X$ is locally compact, and thus Tychonoff. Now, if we set
$$
V := \{ \tilde{f} \, : \, f \in C_b (X)\},
$$
then $\varphi : V \to \Bbb{C}, \tilde{f} \mapsto \psi(f)$ is well-defined and bounded, and by the Hahn-Banach theorem, we can extend $\varphi$ to a bounded functional on all of $C(\beta X)$. Thus, there is a regular complex measure $\nu$ on $\beta X$ satisfying
$$
\psi(f)=\varphi (\tilde{f}) = \int \tilde{f} d \nu \quad \forall f \in C_b (X).
$$
Note though that we integrate $\tilde{f}$, and not $f$ itself.</p>

<p>Conversely, each complex measure $\nu$ on $\beta X$ also induces a linear functional on $C_b (X)$ by setting $\psi(f) := \int \tilde{f} d \nu$.</p>

<p>In fact, $\nu$ is uniquely determined by $\psi$: It is uniquely determined once one knows $\int g d\nu$ for all $g \in C(\beta X)$. But in fact, we have $V = C(\beta X)$, since if $g \in C(\beta X)$ is arbitrary, then $f := g \circ \iota \in C_b (X)$, and $g = \tilde{f}$ is the unique extension of $g$ to a continuous map on $\beta X$.</p>

"2382719","2382894","<p>For you first bullet, you actually have $∫_E |f| \mathrm{d}𝜇 &lt; 𝜀$, not just $|∫_E f \mathrm{d}𝜇| &lt; 𝜀$. You can see that from your previous result by considering the function $|f∣$ instead of $f$ (as said in the comments).</p>

<p>For the second bullet, yes, it makes sense.</p>

<p>If you apply the result for each $n∈ℕ$, you get a $𝛿_n$ (depending on $n$) such that $∫_A |f_n| &lt; 𝜀$ if $m(A) &lt; 𝛿_n$. But these $𝛿_n$ can have an infimum of $0$, so you cannot take this infimum to get a $𝛿$ working for all $n$. But for every <em>finite</em> family of natural number, it works. So we have proved the result for all interval $\{0,1,…,N\}$ instead of all $ℕ$ (we now have to treat what happens at infinity).</p>

<p>We have to find an $N∈ℕ$ and a $𝛿&gt;0$ such that $∫_A |f_n| &lt; 𝜀$ if $m(A)&lt;𝛿$ and $n≥N$. You have to use that $‖f_n-f‖_1 → 0$ to make $f_n$ near enough to $f$. Then, apply the result (Folland 3.6) to $f$ and try to “transfer” it to each measurable function near enough to $f$ (but you will have a bigger $𝜀$ depending on the distance at $f$ you allow). I write what I have in mind below if you want.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Suppose $‖g-f‖ &lt; 𝜀$. It means that $∫_a^b |g-f| &lt; 𝜀$. If we restrict to a subset $A⊆[a,b]$, the integral can only decrease since the integrand is positive: $∫_A |g-f| &lt; 𝜀$. We get $∫_A |g| &lt; 𝜀 + ∫_A |f|$. So by forcing $n$ to be big enough, we can control $∫_A |f_n|$ by $∫_A |f|$. But by the result (Folland 3.6) we can make $∫_A |f|$ small by making $A$ small.<br>
 More precisely, let $N$ be such that $‖f_n-f‖&lt;𝜀/2$ for all $n≥N$. Let $𝛿_∞$ be such that $∫_A |f| &lt; 𝜀/2$ if $m(A) &lt; 𝛿_∞$. Then for all $n≥N$ and all $A$ with $m(A) &lt; 𝛿$, we have $∫_A |f_n| &lt; 𝜀/2 + 𝜀/2 = 𝜀$.<br>
 After that, for each $i&lt;N$, take $𝛿_i$ such that $∫_A |f_i| &lt; 𝜀$ if $m(A) &lt; 𝛿_i$. The final $𝛿$ is $\min(𝛿_0,𝛿_1,…,𝛿_{N-1},𝛿_∞)$.</p>

<p>I don't see the relation with parts (a) and (b) either.</p>

<p>If you are interested, we can formulate that more abstractly using the notion of compactness ($ℕ∪\{∞\}$ behave like a finite set). The two say the same thing, we can make the proofs correspond.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Let $M$ be the set of measurable regions. For $A,B∈M$, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $m(A𝛥B)$, where $𝛥$ is the symmetric difference. (It is like a metric space.) Then we have a continuous function $M×L^1 → ℝ_{≥0}$ sending $(A,f)$ on $∫_A |f|$ (it is $1$-lipschitz in $f$ and continuous in $A$, this is the important thing to prove). The sequence $(f_n)_n$ converging to $f$ is a continuous function from $\overline ℕ$ to $L^1$. This gives a continuous function $M×\overline{ℕ} → ℝ_{≥0}$. The subspace $\{∅\}×\overline{ℕ}$ is sent on $0$. So by the tube lemma, for all $𝜀&gt;0$, there is $𝛿&gt;0$ such that $\{A∈M\,|\,m(A)&lt;𝛿\}×\overline{ℕ}$ is sent in $\left]-𝜀,𝜀\right[$.</p>

"2382749","2382808","<p>We take $\Bbb{N}$ to include zero.</p>

<p>For $x\in \Bbb N $ let proposition $P_x$ be
$$
\forall y\in \Bbb N (x+x \neq y+y+1)
$$
Let $K$ be the set of all $x$ such that $P_x$ is true.  We will establish induction on $K$, to show that $K$ contains every natural number.</p>

<p>To show that zero is in $K$ we must prove 
$$
\forall y \in \Bbb N ( 0+0 \neq y+y+1)
$$
But by the additive identity property, $u+0 = u$ and in particular $0+0 = 0$. And (with $S(t)$ the successor function), by the definition of $1$  $v+1 = v+S(0)$.  Substituting $(y+y)$ for $v$ that reads 
$$
(y+y)+1 = S(y+y)
$$
And by the first ordering axiom, $0$ is not the successor of any natural number, so $0 \neq (y+y)+1$ so 
$$
\forall y\in \Bbb N ( 0+0 \neq y+y+1)
$$</p>

<p>To complete the conditions of the axiom of induction we must show that for every natural number $n$, $n\in K \implies S(n) \in K$.</p>

<p>By the induction hypothesis $P_n$ is true. So
$$
\forall y\in \Bbb N ( n+n \neq y+y+1)
$$
Now assume that for some $y \in \Bbb N$ it were true that 
$ (n+1)+(n+1) = y+y+1$. By the commutative and associative properties of additions, that would be the same as 
$$
(n+n+1) + 1 = y+y+1 
\\ S(n+n+1) =S(y+y)
$$
and by the second axiom defining the successor function if $S(n+n+1)=S(y+y)$ then
$$
y+y=n+n+1
$$ 
That forces $y \neq 0$ by the same ""$0$ is not a successor"" argument,
and also says $y+y = S(n+n)$. Now it is easy to show (again using induction) that $\forall p\in \Bbb N^+( \exists q : (p=S(q))$ so in particular $\exists
z : y=S(z)$.</p>

<p>Then 
$$
y+y = S(z) + S(z) = (z+1)+(z+1) = (z+z+1)+1 = S(z+z+1)
y+y = n+n+1 \implies S(z+z+1) = n+n+1 = S(n+n) \implies (z+z+1) =(n+n)
$$
which contradicts the induction hypothesis. </p>

<p>So for all $y\in \Bbb N$ we have shown  that 
$ (n+1)+(n+1) \neq y+y+1$. But replacing $x$ by $(n+1)$ in the definition of $K_x$,
this is just the statement of $K_{n+1}$:
$$
\forall y\in \Bbb N (  (n+1)+(n+1) \neq y+y+1
$$
Thus induction is established, $K$ includes all natural numbers, $P_x$ is true whenever $x$ is a natural number, and the theorem is proven.</p>

<li>How many different ways are there of choosing 9 numbers?</li>

<p>The probability of drawing numbers that sum to 20 is then the ratio of these two, so the probability that you want is 1 minus this ratio.

"2382785","2382803","<p>Here's an application of projections, called a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stereographic projection</a>, that should seem a bit more ""concrete"" in a way.</p>

<p><strong>This below is the called the <em>inverse stereographic projection</em>, mapping a lower dimension to a higher dimension.</strong></p>

<p>Let's begin like this, I want you to look at the image below first. All it contains is a circle of radius $1$ and a line is in the form $y=mx+1$ with $m$ ranging from $-10$ to $10$.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmmSr.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmmSr.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Consider the very top point of the circle, the point $(0,1)$, as undefined.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that as the slope changes, where the line intersects the circle and the $x$-axis changes as well. In a single snapshot of the gif, let's call the point it intersects on the $x$-axis as $(x_0, 0)$ or just $x_0$ for short. Call the point it intersects on the circle $(x_c,y_c)$</p></li>
<li><p>Now try to imagine this: in that random snapshot of the gif (where the line is held still) map (""assign"") the point $x_0$ to $(x_c,y_c)$. Now go to the next snapshot and do it again, and again, ...</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now let the slope instead of being anything in the range $[-10, 10]$, be anything in $( - \infty, \infty)$. What follows is <em>every single point on the real number line ($x$-axis) gets assigned to a point on the circle!</em> This is the <em>projection</em> aspect. With room to spare even, that point on the top of the circle never got assigned anywhere after all.</p>

<p><strong>Can we find the function of this projection, you say?</strong></p>

<p>Yes! Let's find the function $f$ that tells us where our point $x_0$ goes on the circle. It'll be a function mapping one number to two, or more explicitly, $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S} \backslash \{ (0,1) \}$, where $\mathbb{S} \backslash \{ (0,1) \} = \{  x \in \mathbb{R}^2 | x^2 + y^2 = 1, \ \ (x,y) \neq (0,1) \}$.</p>

<p>To get started we need to know what we have to work with. Without loss of generality let's let the radius be $1$ (that is, you can make the radius whatever you please, I just wanted to make it look pretty in the end). What we have is</p>

<p>$$\begin{cases} x^2+y^2=1 \\ y=mx+1 \text{ where } m = -\frac{1}{x_0} \end{cases} $$</p>

<p>which is actually all we need. Let's leave the $m$ in there for now though to avoid having to deal with messy equations, and just remember that our circle doesn't include the point $(0,1)$.</p>

<p>From here it's a matter of some plug and chug.</p>

<p>$x^2+(mx+1)^2=1$</p>

<p>$x^2+m^2x^2+2mx=0$</p>

<p>$(1+m^2)x^2+2mx=0$</p>

<p>$\displaystyle{ x=\frac{-2m \pm \sqrt{4m^2}}{2(1+m^2)}}$</p>

<p>$\implies x=\displaystyle{\frac{-2m}{1+m^2}}$</p>

<p>Great! Now we complete the same procedure for the other coordinate.</p>

<p>$\displaystyle{\left(\frac{y-1}{m} \right) ^2 + y^2 = 1}$</p>

<p>$y^2-2y+r^2+m^2y^2=m^2$</p>

<p>$(1+m^2)y^2-2y+(1-m^2)=0$</p>

<p>$y=\displaystyle{\frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4-4(1+m^2)(1-m^2)}}{2(1+m^2)}}$</p>

<p>$ y= \displaystyle{\frac{1 \pm m^2}{1+m^2}}$</p>

<p>Here we must choose $1-m^2$ for the numerator because otherwise things would simplify to $y=1$, and remember, (0,1) wasn't defined on our circle.</p>

<p>$\displaystyle{ \implies y=\frac{1-m^2}{1+m^2}}$</p>

<p>All this, in summary, provides the following function:
$$f(x_0)=\displaystyle{ \left&lt; \frac{-2m}{1+m^2}, \frac{1-m^2}{1+m^2} \right&gt;}$$

  <p>It's found as follows: the slope, since we don't have $x_0$, is now given by $\displaystyle{m=\frac{1-y_c}{-x_c}}$. Solving $y=mx+1$ for $x_0$ is done by substituting $y=0$ then some algebra, giving $\displaystyle{x_0 = f^{-1}(x_0) = g(x_c, y_c) = \frac{x_c}{y_c -1}}$.</p>

"2382820","2382891","<p>You are correct, and Godement's proof is incorrect.  His proof proceeds by letting $G$ and $G'$ be two different $\sigma$-compact locally compact groups with the same underlying group, and considers the diagonal $D\subseteq G\times G'$.  He then applies a theorem about $\sigma$-compact locally compact groups to the projection maps $D\to G$ and $D\to G'$.  The problem is that the theorem does not apply, since $D$ may not be $\sigma$-compact or locally compact, since it may not be closed in $G\times G'$.</p>

<p>This is exactly what happens in the case of $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$: the ""diagonal"" in $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^2$ is the graph of a group-isomorphism $\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^2$.  A group-isomorphism $\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^2$ is a horrendously discontinuous map, so its graph is a horrendous non-closed subgroup of $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^2$.  (Quick proof that the graph of an isomorphism $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^2$ cannot be closed: since $f$ cannot be $\mathbb{R}$-linear, there exists $x\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x)\neq xf(1)$.  But $f(q)=qf(1)$ for all $q\in\mathbb{Q}$, so by approximating $x$ by rationals, we find that $(x,xf(1))$ is in the closure of the graph of $f$.)</p>

\begin{equation}0 = z^{14} + z^{15} + z^{16} + z^{17} = z^{14}(1+z+z^2+z^3)\end{equation}

Since

"
"2382867","2382877","<p>I usually tell my students not to memorize a bunch of identities, then very quickly tell them that there are two very useful and important trigonometric identities that let you derive all the rest:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Pythagorean Identity: $\cos(\theta)^2 + \sin(\theta)^2 = 1$ for all $\theta$, and</li>
<li>The Angle Addition Formula for Cosine: $\cos(\theta+\varphi) = \cos(\theta)\cos(\varphi) - \sin(\theta)\sin(\varphi)$</li>
</ol>

<p>Writing $2x = x+x$ and applying the angle addition formula, we get
\begin{equation}
\cos(2x)
= \cos(x+x)
= \cos(x)\cos(x) - \sin(x)\sin(x)
= \cos(x)^2 - \sin(x)^2.\end{equation}
Then the Pythagorean identity implies that $\sin(x)^2 = 1-\cos(x)^2$, and so we have
\begin{equation}
\cos(2x)
= \cos(x)^2 - \sin(x)^2
= \cos(x)^2 - (1-\cos(x)^2)
= 2\cos(x)^2 - 1,\end{equation}
which is what you wanted.</p>

<hr>

<p>Geometrically, the Pythagorean identity is just the distance formula, which is really just the Pythagorean theorem in disguise.  Suppose that $p = (x_1,y_1)$ and $q = (x_2,y_2)$ are points in the plane.  How do we measure the distance between them?  This is the same as asking how long the segment joining the to points is, and this segment is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length $|x_1-x_2|$ (the horizontal distance between the two points) and $|y_1-y_2|$ (the vertical distance between the two points).  By the Pythagorean theorem
\begin{equation}
\text{hypotenuse}^2 = \text{leg}_1^2 + \text{leg}_2^2.
\end{equation}
That is
\begin{equation}
d(p,q)^2 = |x_1-x_2|^2 + |y_1-y_2|^2,
\end{equation}
where $d(p,q)$ denotes the distance between the two points.  Now, remember that if $\theta$ is some angle, then $\cos(\theta)$ and $\sin(\theta)$ are the coordinates of a point on the unit circle (specifically, the point where the angle $\theta$ crosses the unit circle).  But if $(x,y)$ is any point on the unit circle, then
\begin{equation}
1 = 1^2
= d((0,0),(x,y))^2
= |0-x|^2 + |0-y|^2
= x^2 + y^2.
\end{equation}
Setting $x=\cos(\theta)$ and $y=\sin(\theta)$, we get the Pythagorean identity.</p>

<p>A group action $*: X \times G \to X,\, (x,g) \mapsto x*g$ is <strong>simply transitive</strong> if for any $x,y\in X$ there is a <strong>unique</strong> $g \in G$ such that $x*g=y.$</p>

<p>In your particular example $G=E$ as an additive abelian group $(E,+)$. Let's show first that the action is transitive.</p>

<p>Let $(x', y'),(x,y) \in \mathbb{A}.$ We want to show that there is a $(g,h) \in E$ such that $(x',y')*(g,h)=(x' + g,e^h y')=(x,y).$</p>

<p>So, choose $g=(x-x')$ and $h=\ln(\frac{y}{y'})$. Since $y,y' &gt;0, \ln(\frac{y}{y'})\in \mathbb{R}$ is well defined and $(g,h)\in E$. Then</p>

<p>$$(x',y')*(g,h)=(x' + (x-x'), e^{\ln(\frac{y}{y'})}y')=(x,\frac{y}{y'}y')=(x,y).$$</p>

<p>Hence, the action is transitive. To show that $(g,h)\in E$ is unique, suppose $(g',h')\in E$ also satisfies $(x',y')*(g',h')=(x,y).$ Then</p>

<p>$$(x'+ g, e^hy')=(x,y)=(x' +g',e^{h'}y'),$$</p>

<p>$$x'+g=x'+g' \, \text{ and } \, e^hy' = e^{h'}y', $$</p>

<p>so</p>

<p>$$g =g' \, \text{ and } \, y'&gt;0 \implies e^h = e^{h'} \implies h=\ln(e^h)=\ln(e^{h'})=h'.$$</p>

<p>Therefore $(g,h)=(g',h')$ and so the action is simply transitive.</p>
"
"2382881","2382954","<p>When all identity maps satisfy your property, then this is, at heart, a sub-category, where the objects are the same and we take a subset of the morphisms. </p>

<p>You probably want to confine yourself to cases where all identity maps satisfies your property, because the cases where some identity functions are not in the set are ""odder.""</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ol>
<li>Functions which are not onto.</li>
<li>Functions which are not 1-1.</li>
<li>Functions which are contractible to a point.</li>
<li>Functions that factor through a class of sets - $f:A\to B$ factoring though the class if there is a $C$ in the class such that $f$ factors as $A\to C\to B$ for some functions.</li>
<li>The case of constant functions is a special case of 4.</li>
</ol>

<p>These cases also have a side-property that give $f,g$, for $g\circ f$ to have the property, you need only one of them to have the property. For (1), you only need $g$ in the class. For (2), if $f$ is in the class. For (3-5), If either $f$ or $g$ satisfies our property, then $g\circ f$ is.</p>

<p>So, these cases are sort of like ""ideals"" in the parent category, rather than sub-categories.</p>

<p>The cases (1) and (2) act like prime ideals - if $g\circ f$ is not one-to-one, then one of $f$ or $g$ is not one-to-one.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you have a collection of these properties (either with the identities or not,) then the intersection of them is also a property like this. So differentiable one-to-one functions are closed under composition. </p>
"
"2382895","2388279","<p>Here is the story of my quest for the bounds. I put $\varepsilon=\|Q\|_\infty$ and  split the quest into two parts.</p>

<p>The first of them was for upper bounds for $\det(I+Q)-1$. Clearly, they follow from  upper bounds for $|\det(I+Q)|$. We have  $\|I+Q\|_\infty\le 1+\varepsilon$, so $|\det(I+Q)|\le (1+2\varepsilon+n\varepsilon^2)^{n/2}$, by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard%27s_inequality#Alternate_forms_and_corollaries"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hadamard’s inequality</a>. Compare it with the bound $2^nn!\varepsilon$ which you have (as I guess, for $\varepsilon\le 1$). By Stirling’s formula, there exists a number $0&lt;\theta&lt;1$ such that $n!=\sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac ne\right)^n e^{\frac \theta{12n}}$. Thus $2^nn!\varepsilon\simeq n^n(2/e)^n\varepsilon$, so Hadamard’s inequality based bound is better. On the other hand, it is almost tight for big $\varepsilon$ (and at least some $n$), because $|\det (1+\varepsilon H_n)|\simeq |\varepsilon H_n|=\varepsilon^nn^{n/2}$, where $H_n$ is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_matrix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hadamard matrix</a> of order $n$ (provided it exists for such $n$). In case when you are interested only in small $\varepsilon\le 1$, I conjectured that this lower bound can be improved. From the other hand, I looked for inequalities applicable to bounds for $|\det(I+Q)-1|$ in “Inequalities” by Edwin F. Beckenbach and Richard Bellman and “Introduction to matrix analysis” by the latter, and found none, besides already used  Hadamard’s inequality. </p>

<p>So I started the quest for lower bounds for $\det(I+Q)-1$. Of course, it is at least $-|\det(I+Q)|-1$, so we can apply here the upper bounds for  $|\det(I+Q)|$ from the first part of the quest. For big $\varepsilon$ the summand $-1$ is not essential, so we stop here. </p>

<p>Cleary, if $\det(I+Q)=0$ then we are done. So we may assume the converse. Then provided  $\det(I+Q)&gt;0$ (so we put $\varepsilon&lt;1$) we can bound it using the equlity $\det(I+Q)=1/\det (I+Q)^{-1}$, represent the matrix $(I+Q)^{-1}$ as $I+P$ with $\|P\|_\infty$ small and then apply use for $\det(I+P)$ the upper bounds from the first part of the quest. </p>

<p>For instance, for $\varepsilon&lt;1/n$ the series $-Q+Q^2-Q^3\dots$ converges, and I guess we can put as $P$ its limit. In this case $$\|P\|_\infty\le \varepsilon+n\varepsilon^2+n^2\varepsilon^3+\dots=\frac\varepsilon{1-n\varepsilon} .$$</p>

<p>An other, straightforward way to bound $\det (I+Q)^{-1}$ using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjugate_matrix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">adjugate matrix</a> of $I+Q$, but this way is complicate, uses the inductive bounds for minors, and I guess that finally it’ll give a weak bound. </p>

<p>But I came to idea to use bounds following from Gauss elimination method for solving systems of linear equations, which looked much more promising. </p>

<p>But at this point I decided to google and found relevant results, which already were partially overlapping with mine. Namely, I found a paper “Note  on  best  possible  bounds  for  determinants of matrices  close  to  the  identity matrix” [BOS2] by Richard P. Brent, Judy-anne H. Osborn, and Warren D. Smith. </p>

<p>My prize was that bound $\det(I+Q)\ge 1−n\varepsilon$ for $\varepsilon&lt;1/n$ is known from Ostrowski’s paper from 1938.  Bounds based on Gauss elimination method are worse. This is not so surprising,  because Ostrowski’s bound is best-possible, as it is attained if $Q =-\varepsilon J$, where $J$ is the $n\times n$ matrix of all ones.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as it sometimes happens in a life of a professional mathematician, the upper bound $|\det(I+Q)|\le (1+2\varepsilon+n\varepsilon^2)^{n/2}$ was already proven (two years ago by the same way) in Theorem 2 of [BOS2]. The authors also remarked that this bound is  best-possible  if  a  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_matrix#Skew_Hadamard_matrices"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">skew-Hadamard matrix</a> $H$ of order $n$ exists. To  see  this,  consider $I+Q=(1 + \varepsilon)I + \varepsilon(H − I)$. Such a matrix exists for $n =1, 2$, all multiples of four up to and including $4\times × 68$, as well as infinitely many larger $n$, such as all powers of two, see [CD]. Sharp bounds for small orders for which a skew-Hadamard matrix does not exist (e.g. $n=3$) are considered in [BOS1, §4.1].</p>

"
"2383014","2383099","<p>Let's go about it piece by piece. This will be an informal explanation but I hope it helps...</p>

<p>You are trying to prove that </p>

<p>$$X= \{\,f\in \mathbb{C}[x]: f(x)=\frac{1}{x-\alpha}, \text{ for some } \alpha \in \mathbb{C}\}$$</p>

<p>is linearly independent. That is, for any finite number of distinct $\, f_1,\ldots,f_k \in X,$
$$F(x)=\sum_{\nu=1}^k \frac{c_\nu}{x-\alpha_{\nu}}=0 \iff \forall \nu \,(c_{\nu}=0).$$</p>

<p>The author of your proof argues by contradiction. If not all of the $c_{\nu}$'s are zero, could $F(x)=0$ for all $x$? The answer is no. Why?</p>

<p>Assume that you already know that $(x-\alpha_1)^{-1}$ is unbounded ""near"" $\alpha_1, c_1 \neq 0$ and the $(x-\alpha_{\nu})^{-1}, \nu \neq 1$ are  bounded ""near"" $\alpha_1.$ Let $N_2,\ldots,N_k$ be their respective bounds.
In that case</p>

<p>$$\bigg\| \sum_{\nu\neq1}\frac{c_{\nu}}{x-\alpha_{\nu}}\bigg\|= C \leq \|c_2\|N_2 +\ldots+\|c_k\|N_k= K$$
for all $x$ ""near"" $\alpha_1$. Now, since $(x-\alpha_1)^{-1}$ is unbounded ""near"" $\alpha_1$ we can find some $x$ ""near"" $\alpha_1$ such that $$\bigg\|\frac{c_1}{x-\alpha_1}\bigg\|&gt;K.$$</p>

<p>For that particular $x$ we have that $F(x)\neq 0$ since the additive inverse of a complex number has the same norm and this 2 numbers do not. Hence $F(x)$ cannot be the zero function. <strong>QED</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why is $(x-\alpha_1)^{-1}$ unbounded ""near"" $\alpha_1$?</strong></p>

<p>Recall that for $x \in \mathbb{R}^+$,$$\lim_{x\to0}\frac{1}{x}= \infty $$</p>

<p>Well, 
$$\lim_{x\to\alpha_1}\|x-\alpha_1\| = 0 \implies \lim_{x\to\alpha_1}\frac{1}{\|x-\alpha_1\|}= \infty,$$</p>

<p>so the norm of the complex number $(x-\alpha_1)^{-1}$ tends to infinity as $x$ tends to $\alpha_1,$ hence $(x-\alpha_1)^{-1}$ is unbounded ""near"" $\alpha_1.$</p>

<p><strong>Why is $(x-\alpha_{\nu})^{-1}$ bounded ""near"" $\alpha_1, \nu \neq 1$?</strong></p>

<p>Take any $\nu \neq 1,$ then $\alpha_{\nu} \neq \alpha_1$ and hence $d_{\nu} = \|\alpha_{\nu} - \alpha_1 \| &gt; 0.$ </p>

<p>Now, assume $x$ is ""near"" $\alpha_1$ if $\|x - \alpha_1\| &lt; \frac{d}{2}$, where $d=\min\{d_2, \ldots, d_k\}.$ So none of the $\alpha_{\nu}$'s are ""near""  $\alpha_1.$</p>

<p>Then if $x$ is ""near"" $\alpha_1$, the distance between say $\alpha_\nu$ and $x,$ $\|x-\alpha_{\nu}\|&gt;d_{\nu} - \frac{d}{2},$ hence $\|(x-\alpha_{\nu})^{-1}\| &lt; \frac{1}{d_{\nu}- \, \frac{d}{2}}=N_{\nu},$ hence $(x-\alpha_{\nu})^{-1}$ is bounded ""near"" $\alpha_1, \nu \neq 1.$</p>

<p>One way is to look at the derivative of $f(x) = e^x - x - 1$, which is $f'(x) = e^x - 1$, and note that it is zero only at $x=0$. The second derivative is $f''(x)=e^x &gt; 0$ for all $x$, so $x=0$ is a global minimizer. Finally, note $f(0) = 0$, which yields $e^x-x-1 = f(x) \ge 0$ for all $x$.</p>

<p><strong>The construction of a bijective function:</strong></p>

<p>Let $f:\mathbb{R}_{[0,1)}\rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}}$</p>

<p>Suppose $x\in \mathbb{R}_{[0,1)}$ is not of the form $\frac{n}{2^m}$, where $n&lt;2^m$ is odd natural number and $m\in \mathbb{N}$, then $f(x)=$ the final sequence you get from the <strong><em>Structure</em></strong> for $x$.</p>

<p>Now if $x\in \mathbb{R}_{[0,1)}$ is of the form $\frac{n}{2^m}$, where $n&lt;2^m$ is odd natural number and $m\in \mathbb{N}$, then values looks like this:
$$\frac{1}{2}\\\frac{1}{4}\space\space\frac{3}{4}\\\frac{1}{8}\space\space\frac{3}{8}\space\space\frac{5}{8}\space\space\frac{7}{8}\\\frac{1}{16}\space\space\frac{3}{16}\space\space\frac{5}{16}\space\space\frac{7}{16}\space\space\frac{9}{16}\space\space\frac{11}{16}\space\space\frac{13}{16}\space\space\frac{15}{16}\\\dots\\\dots\\\dots$$</p>

<p>First fix $f(\frac{1}{2})=(1,1,1,\dots)$. Now calculate the sequence you get from <strong><em>Structure</em></strong> for taking $x=1/2$. Surely you get $(1,0,0,0,\dots)$. Now fix $f(\frac{1}{4})=(1,0,0,0,\dots)$ and $f(\frac{3}{4})=(0,1,1,1,\dots)$. Again calculate the sequence you get from <strong><em>Structure</em></strong> for taking $x=1/4$ and $x=3/4$. Sequence you get are $(0,1,0,0,0,\dots)$ and $(1,1,0,0,0,\dots)$ respectively. You immediately fix $f(\frac{1}{8})=(0,1,0,0,0,\dots)$, $f(\frac{3}{8})=(0,0,1,1,1,\dots)$, $f(\frac{5}{8})=(1,1,0,0,0,\dots)$ and $f(\frac{7}{8})=(1,0,1,1,1,\dots)$.Continue in this way and finally you have $f$ is a bijective mapping.</p>

"
"2383035","2389378","<p>Suppose $Y_i\in\{0,1\}$. Then we have completely characterized $Y_i$ by specifying $$P(Y_i=0)=p_i$$ because it forces $P(Y_i=1)=1-p_i$. The probability mass function completely specifies the random variable, so there is only one parameter for a specific $i$, which is $p_i$.
Furthermore, you said the variables are IID, so $p_i=p\;\forall\;i$. But this is exactly a Bermoulli distribution. So that's really the only option.</p>

<p>However, for logistic regression, I tend to think of it as trying to construct a function $f : \mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$. You feed it vectors $X_i\in\mathbb{R}^n$ (with components $x_{ij}$), and try to predict the correct label $\mathfrak{y}_i=\ell(X_i)$. Here are there are many assumptions, beyond the normal IID assumption on the data. For instance, logistic regression is a <em>linear</em> model: it does not assume that the features and labels are linearly related, but it does assume that the relation between the features and the log-odds of the labels <em>are</em> linearly related. 
It assumes that $P(\mathfrak{y}|X)$ is Bermoulli (whereas linear regression tends to assume $P(\mathfrak{y}|X)$ is Gaussian).
It also assumes that the error terms are independent  and that there is no <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">multicollinearity</a>.
Note that these <em>assumptions</em> do not mean that logistic regression <em>won't work</em> without it; it just won't work <em>as well</em> as theory would predict.</p>

"2383045","2383076","<p>Your answer is almost correct, though as you point out you can't easily integrate until the different variables $(p,t)$ are on different sides of the equation. The reason is that the proportion $p$ is actually a function of $t$, and so when we integrate</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
\int r[1- p(t)]dt &amp;= r\int (1-p(t))dt &amp; \neq r(1-p)t
\end{align*}</p>

<p>So the only adjustment I would make is in that step, grouping different variables on different sides of the equation to make it clearer. Here's one way to do it. </p>

<p>Let $H$ represent the volume of helium. </p>

<p>The volume of helium at one particular instant is $pV$. You correctly determine that the volume in the next instant will be $pV + r\,dt - pr\,dt$. Hence the change in volume of helium is</p>

<p>$$\begin{align*}
d H &amp;= (pV +r\,dt - pr\,dt)-pV &amp;= r(1-p)\,dt

<p>so the change in proportion of helium is </p>

<p>$$\begin{align*}
d p = \frac{d H}{V} &amp;= \frac{r(1-p)\,dt}{V} = (1-p)R\,dt 
\end{align*}$$</p>

<p>which we can rearrange as</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{1-p}dp &amp;= R \cdot dt
\end{align*}</p>

<p>This is called a separable differential equation, because we can put the different variables $(p, t)$ on separate sides of the equation. To solve, we integrate each side separately:</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
\int \frac{1}{1-p}dp &amp;=  \int R \cdot dt\\
-\log(1-p) &amp;= Rt + C\\
1 - p &amp;= \exp{(-C)} \exp{(-Rt)}\\
(p - 1) &amp;= -A\exp(-Rt) &amp; \{A \equiv \exp{(-C)}\}\\
p &amp;= 1 - A\cdot \exp{(-Rt)}

<p>And from our initial condition that $p(t=0)=0$, we find that $A=1$ so</p>

<p>$$p(t) = 1-\exp{(-Rt)}$$</p>

"
"2383054","2383098","<p><em>What would be the meaning of the value G($\omega$)?</em></p>

<p>Using the notation you gave, a function $f(t)$ can be expressed by its Fourier transform (I excluded the constant parameters) as:
$$f(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} G(\omega)e^{i\omega t}d\omega$$
In this form, the original signal is expressed as a 'sum' over all frequencies $\omega$ of the functions $e^{i\omega t}$. The function $G(\omega)$ gives the amplitude and the phase (this is a complex value) for the specific function $e^{i\omega t}$ that corresponds to $\omega$.</p>

<p><em>Mathematically why we get that so close relationship between the domains?</em></p>

<p>Can you rephrase this one? What I guess you ask here is why there is a change from time to frequency. If that is the case, I'll try cover it. </p>

<p>Your signal is a function that depends of $t$. By applying a Fourier transform on it, you basically break that function in a 'sum' of $e^{i\omega t}$ functions that depend on the frequency $\omega$, each function having a given amplitude and a phase. As mentioned above, $G(\omega)$ gives you just that, for each frequency needed, in order to reconstruct your signal. That is why the Fourier Transform of the signal aka $G(\omega)$ is a function of frequency, and not time.</p>

<p>I would suggest, you look at this video: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r18Gi8lSkfM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r18Gi8lSkfM</a></p>

<p>It should help with the idea behind Fourier transform, and what it does, although the video focuses on periodic functions. Once you get that part, going to your specific signals should be OK.</p>

<p><strong><em>Edit:</em></strong> </p>

<p>From what I understand from your comment, you asked if one can use the FT to 'encode' some data, such that whenever is needed it can be decoded back and analysed. Yes, this can be done, not sure if it is worth it in terms of data storage, but it is possible.</p>

<p>I'll also add this because it might help get a qualitative understanding of the FT and why it is used most of the time. You can think of this frequency in the musical sense. Say you have a sound generator, that can make one perfect sine wave sound of a given frequency. Now, you wish to generate a 'sound' that results from combining more sine wave frequencies generated individually using one generator each. So at the end, let's assume that you have 1000 generators, each generating a different a sound with a given frequency, and for each generator/frequency you have the ability to control the volume. If you record this using a microphone, you'll get a signal. If you take the FT of that signal, surprise, surprise, what you get are the frequencies and the volume settings you used to generate it in the first place (also with some phase, but again, it isn't important here). You will see if you plot $|G(\omega)|$, that for each frequency you used, say 1kHz, 2kHz, 3kHz and 4kHz, you'll get a very narrow peak around the values $\omega =$ 1kHz, 2kHz, 3kHz and 4kHz and that the value $|G(\omega)|$ at those peaks will be proportional with the volume that you used.</p>

<p>From this, consider that you have a generator for every real number and that you can adjust the volume on all of them as before. Start all of them after they are set up, record the signal with a microphone, do the FT of the signal and you will be in your scenario with functions that are not periodic.</p>

<p>Now, the reason I mentioned all of that is to link it with what I assume the geophysics people use it for and that is to check what frequencies make up an earthquake (or any other earth vibration) and what amplitude (aka volume) does it have. It is the same reasoning as above, with the only difference that now you don't know the frequencies and the volumes on the generators, you only have the resulting signal. What do you do in this case if you want the set up parameters? You take the FT. Why does it matter? Because at some frequencies, different structures might resonate and they can collapse even for small intensity of vibrations. This would be an example.</p>

Since $x_{n+1}=y_{n+1}-y_n=1/y^2_n,$ we have $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}x_n\,n^{2/3}=3^{-2/3},$$ and thus $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}x^3_n\,n^2=3^{-2}=\frac19.$$</p>

"2383139","2383168","<p>You are asking for the dimension of a fiber of the projection map $\pi_1$, that is, for $x \in \mathbb{P}^n$, what is the dimension of the set
$$
  \{ f \in P(n,d) \mid f(x) = 0 \}.
$$
This turns out to be a hyperplane in $P(n,d)$, so its dimension is $\dim P(n,d) - 1 = \binom{n+d}{n} - 1$, and that is the rank of the vector bundle.</p>

<p>One simple way to see that the indicated set is indeed a hyperplane in $P(n,d)$ is to take the coordinates on $P(n,d)$ to be the coefficients of monomials appearing in polynomials $f \in P(n,d)$. That is, write each $f = a_1 x_0^d + a_2 x_0^{d-1} x_1 + \dotsb$, and take the $a_i$ to be the coordinates on $P(n,d)$. Now for a fixed $x \in \mathbb{P}^n$, the condition $f(x) = 0$ is a single linear condition on the $a_i$. It is a nonzero condition because $x \in \mathbb{P}^n$ has at least one non-vanishing coordinate, so at least one of the $x_i^d$ is nonzero.</p>

<p>Finally a note of caution. Just because the fibers are vector spaces doesn't mean that $Z$ is a vector bundle. You have to have local trivializations. </p>
"
"2383142","2384082","<p>I will answer your original question. By density you can assume that $u$ is regular and that $\Omega$ is a rectangle, say, $(a,b)\times (c,d)$. By the fundamental theorem of calculus and Holder's inequality
$$|u(x,c)|^r\le |u(x,y)|^r+\int_c^y r|u(x,s)|^{r-1}|\partial_yu(x,s)|\,ds.$$
Integrating in $x$ you get
$$\int_a^b|u(x,c)|^rdx\le \int_a^b|u(x,y)|^rdx+\int_a^b\int_c^y r|u(x,s)|^{r-1}|\partial_yu(x,s)|\,dsdx.$$
Integrating in $y$ over $(c,c+\varepsilon)$ gives 
$$\varepsilon\int_a^b|u(x,c)|^rdx\le \int_c^{c+\varepsilon}\int_a^b|u(x,y)|^rdxdy+\varepsilon\int_a^b\int_c^{c+\varepsilon} r|u(x,s)|^{r-1}|\partial_yu(x,s)|\,dsdx.$$
By Holder's inequality you get
$$\varepsilon\int_a^b|u(x,c)|^rdx\le \int_c^{c+\varepsilon}\int_a^b|u(x,y)|^rdxdy+r\varepsilon\left(\int_a^b\int_c^{c+\varepsilon} |u(x,s)|^{2(r-1)}dsdx\right)^{1/2}\left(\int_a^b\int_c^{c+\varepsilon} |\partial_y u(x,s)|^2dsdx\right)^{1/2}
$$
If $r=1$ you get 
$$\int_a^b|u(x,c)|\,dx\le\frac1\varepsilon \int_c^{c+\varepsilon}\int_a^b|u(x,y)|\,dxdy+((b-a)\varepsilon )^{1/2}\left(\int_a^b\int_c^{c+\varepsilon} |\partial_y u(x,s)|^2dsdx\right)^{1/2}.
$$
This inequality gives you compactness of $W^{1,2}(\Omega) \hookrightarrow L^{1}(\partial \Omega)$. Indeed, if you have a bounded sequence in $W^{1,2}(\Omega)$, then by Rellich-Kondrachov compactness, a subsequence $\{u_n\}$ will converge to some function $u$ in $L^2(\Omega)$ and so 
$$\int_a^b|(u_n-u)(x,c)|\,dx\le\frac1\varepsilon \int_c^{c+\varepsilon}\int_a^b|(u_n-u)(x,y)|\,dxdy+((b-a)\varepsilon )^{1/2}C.
$$
Letting $n\to \infty$ gives
$$\limsup_n\int_a^b|(u_n-u)(x,c)|\,dx\le ((b-a)\varepsilon )^{1/2}C.
$$
and now you let $\varepsilon\to 0$ to conclude that 
$$\lim_n\int_a^b|(u_n-u)(x,c)|\,dx=0.$$</p>

<p>If $r&gt;1$ you get 
$$ \varepsilon\int_a^b|u(x,c)|^rdx\le\int_c^{c+\varepsilon}\int_a^b|u(x,y)|^rdxdy+r\varepsilon\left(\int_a^b\int_c^{c+\varepsilon} |u(x,s)|^{2(r-1)}dsdx\right)^{1/2}\left(\int_a^b\int_c^{c+\varepsilon} |\partial_y u(x,s)|^2dsdx\right)^{1/2}
\\\le \int_c^{c+\varepsilon}\int_a^b|u(x,y)|^rdxdy+r\varepsilon \int_a^b\int_c^{c+\varepsilon} |u(x,s)|^{2(r-1)}dsdx+r\varepsilon \int_a^b\int_c^{c+\varepsilon} |\partial_y u(x,s)|^2dsdx.
$$
Since $N=2$ you have that $W^{1,2}(\Omega)$ is contained in $L^q(\Omega)$ for every $q&lt;\infty$. Hence, the previous inequality says that  $W^{1,2}(\Omega) \hookrightarrow L^{r}(\partial \Omega)$ for every $r$. Since for $r=1$ you have compactness, you get compactness for every $r$ by interpolation.
The general case follows by flattening the boundary locally and using a partition of unity.</p>

"2383203","2383226","<p>If you want to formalize the idea that any $E \in \mathbb{B}$ can be obtained by applying countably many set operations on sets of $\mathbb{B}$, here is a useful lemma:</p>

  <p><strong>Lemma.</strong> Let $\mathbb{B}_0 = \mathbb{B}$, and we define $\mathbb{B}_{\alpha}$ for countable ordinals $\alpha &gt; 0$ recursively by</p>

  <p>Then the union $\cup_{\alpha} \mathbb{B}_{\alpha}$ over all countable ordinals $\alpha$ is exactly $\sigma(\mathbb{B})$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, we check that</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If $E \in \mathbb{B}_{\alpha}$, then $E^c \in \mathbb{B}_{\alpha+1}$. This shows that $\cup_{\alpha} \mathbb{B}_{\alpha}$ is closed under complement.</p></li>
<li><p>By the transfinite induction, $\mathbb{B}_{\alpha} \subseteq \sigma(\mathbb{B})$ for all countable ordinals $\alpha$. So $\cup_{\alpha} \mathbb{B}_{\alpha} \subseteq \sigma(\mathbb{B})$.</p></li>
<li><p>To show that $\cup_{\alpha} \mathbb{B}_{\alpha}$ is closed under countable union, it suffices to notice that for any sequence $(\beta_n)$ of countable ordinals there exists a countable ordinal $\alpha$ such that $\beta_n &lt; \alpha$ for all $n$.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So it follows that $\cup_{\alpha} \mathbb{B}_{\alpha}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra satisfying $\mathbb{B} \subseteq \cup_{\alpha} \mathbb{B}_{\alpha} \subseteq \sigma(\mathbb{B})$. By the minimality of $\sigma(\mathbb{B})$, the desired conclusion follows.</p>

<hr>

<p>As an alternative argument,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is easy to check that $f^{-1}(\sigma(\mathbb{B}))$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. Since $f^{-1}(\mathbb{B})$ is a subset of this $\sigma$-algebra, we have $\sigma(f^{-1}(\mathbb{B})) \subseteq f^{-1}(\sigma(\mathbb{B}))$.</p></li>

<p>Then $\mathbb{B} \subseteq \mathcal{F}$ and it is routine to check that $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under both complement and countable union. So $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra and by the minimality we have $\mathcal{F} = \sigma(\mathbb{B})$.

We identify $\mathbb{R}$ with the set of ordered pairs $(v,q)$ where $v\in V$ and $q\in \mathbb{Q}$.  Let $A$ be the set of $(v,q)$ such that $v&gt;0$ and $B$ be the set of $(v,q)$ such that $v&lt;0$.  Then $A$ and $B$ are a partition of the irrational numbers, since $(v,q)$ is rational iff $v=0$.

Conversely, every partition $A\cup B$ of the irrationals into two sets closed under addition arises from a total order on $V$ in this way.  Indeed, given such a partition, we get an ordering $\preceq$ on $V$ by saying $V\cap A$ is the set of positive elements of $V$.

$V_L(b)=-m$. The generator $\tau$ of the Galois group takes $b$ to $b+1$. To find the ramification groups under the

<p>Let's identify a generator of $P_L$. There are integers $r$, $s$ with $1=-rm+sp$. Choose $r$ positive with $0&lt;r&lt;p$. We can take $\pi_L=b^r\pi_K^s$. Then
$$\frac{\tau(\pi_L)}{\pi_L}=\frac{(b+1)^r}{b^r}\equiv 1+r/b\pmod{b^{-2}}.$$
So
$$\tau(\pi_L)-\pi_L\equiv r \pi_L/b\pmod{\pi_L/b^2}.$$
So $\tau$ acts trivially on $O_L/P_L^n$ iff $n\le m$

Also (with the Schoof algorithm ?) one can show $E$ is generated by two points $P= (-2,4)$ of infinite order and $Q = (0,0)$ of order $2$.</p></li>
<li><p>Let $p = 2^l-1$, assume it is prime, and set $E(p) : y^2 = x^3-12x,  (x,y) \in \mathbb{F}_p$, still having CM by $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. The CM theory says $E(p) \simeq \mathbb{Z}[i]/(F-1)$ where $F = a+ib$ is equal to the Frobenius $(x,y) \mapsto (x^p,y^p)$, and $F^2 =-p$.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus $-p = (F-1)^2-1+2(F-1)$ and $F-1$ is coprime with every prime $\ne 2$ and $E(p)$ is cyclic with $2^l$ elements with $P$ as generator.</p></li>
<li><p>If $p$ is not prime and $ord(P) = 2^l$, then take $q$ the least prime factor of $2^l-1$, we still have $ord(P) = 2^l$ in $E(q)$. But (by the Hasse bound) this group has at most $q+1+2\sqrt{q} &lt; 2^l$ points, a contradiction.</p></li>

"2383295","2383648","<p>Since we aim to apply the closed graph theorem, there is no need to get a bound on $\|A^{-1}\|$. We just apply the theorem.</p>

<p>Suppose that $A:X\to Y$ is a bounded linear bijection between Banach spaces.
Due to the closed graph theorem, it suffices to prove that the graph $\Gamma(A^{-1})$ of $A^{-1}$ is a closed subset of $Y\times X$. To this end, suppose $(y_n)$ is a sequence in $Y$ such that $y_n\to y$ in $Y$ and $A^{-1}y_n\to x$ in $X$ for some $y\in Y$ and $x\in X$. We need to show that $A^{-1}y=x$.
The continuity of $A$ yields that $y_n=AA^{-1}y_n\to Ax$, and thus by uniqueness of limits, $y=Ax$. Therefore $A^{-1}y=x$. This completes the proof that $\Gamma(A^{-1})$ is closed, and consequently that $A^{-1}$ is bounded.</p>

<p>This means that multiplication by $A$ is surjective and injective. Therefore it has an inverse.</p>

<p>For $B$ the argument is similar. $(AB)^{-1}A$ is a left inverse of $B$. Therefore the kernel of $B$ is zero. Using that the space is finite dimensional we get that the range is the whole space. Therefore it has an inverse too.</p>

"2383342","2383347","<p>This is not quite correct. In particular, $P(a^n)=0\Leftrightarrow P(a)=0$ does not necessarily hold : only one implication does, namely $P(a)=0\Rightarrow P(a^n)=0$.</p>

<p>Here's a hint on how to finish the proof : since the implication $P(a)=0\Rightarrow P(a^n)=0$ holds for all $a\in \Bbb R$, you can iterate this result, and thus any root $a$ gives a sequence of roots $a,a^n,(a^n)^n=a^{n^2},\dots$ (assuming $n\geq 2$ as Henning Makholm mentioned in his comment and his answer) But a polynomial cannot have infinitely many roots, so this sequence must repeat itself at some points.

$$f^{(2n)}(0)=0\mbox{ and }f^{(2n+1)}(0)=\frac{(2n)!}{n!}\ \forall n\in\mathbb{N}$$
So, shall we write it - let $k=n$:
$$f^{(2k)}(0)=0\mbox{ and }f^{(2k+1)}(0)=\frac{(2k)!}{k!}\ \forall k\in\mathbb{N}$$
We have just ""renamed"" $n$ to $k$. Now, we have, since all even terms of the MacLaurin series expansion of $f$ are zero:
$$\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{f^{k}(0)}{k!}x^k\overset{\text{all even terms}}{\underset{\text{are zero}}{=}}\sum_{k\text{ is odd}}\frac{f^{k}(0)}{k!}x^k\overset{k=2m+1}{=}\sum_{m=1}^\infty\frac{f^{2m+1}(0)}{(2m+1)!}x^{2m+1}\overset{(2)}{=}\sum_{m=0}^\infty\frac{1}{(2m+1)m!}x^{2m+1}$$</p>

"2383389","2383425","<p>As mentioned in the comments in this particular case an automorphism of the field $\Bbb{Q}[\alpha]$ is determined by its action on $\sqrt{3}$ and $\sqrt{5}$.  To answer your question as to what is going on more generally one can look at the discriminant $\Delta = \prod_{i&lt;j}(\alpha_i-\alpha_j)^2$.  $\Delta$ is fixed by the action of the Galois group, but if we consider the action of the Galois group on $\sqrt{\Delta}$, we find for $\sigma$ in the Galois group, $\sigma(\sqrt{\Delta}) = \text{sign}(\sigma)\sqrt{\Delta}$.  It's obvious that $\Delta$ lies in the ground field (since it's fixed by the Galois group), but if $\Delta$ is a square, then $\sqrt{\Delta}$ also lies in the ground field from which we can conclude that all the elements of the Galois group have even signature.  Finally getting back to your question about $\Bbb{Q}[\alpha]$.  Since the discriminant of $f(x)$ equals $2^{14}\,3^2\,5^2$, we can conclude the discriminant of $\Bbb{Q}[\alpha]$ is a square (in fact, $2^4\,3^2\,5^2$).

"2383399","2384010","<p>You are not really using Evan's results since it considers bounded open sets, which has boundary $\Gamma_T$. Indeed just prove directly: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Weak maximum principle: Let $f : M\times [0,T]\to \mathbb R$ satisfies 
  $$ (\partial_t - \Delta) f \ge 0.$$ 
  If $f\ge 0$ at $t=0$, then $f\ge 0$ on $[0,T]$. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proof: Let $\epsilon &gt;0$ and consider $f_\epsilon = f+ \epsilon t$. Then 
$$ (\partial_t - \Delta ) f_\epsilon \ge \epsilon, \ \ \ f_\epsilon \ge 0.$$
If $f_\epsilon &lt;0$ at some points, since $M\times [0,T]$ is compact, let $X=(x, t)$ be where $f_\epsilon$ is minimized. Then $t&gt;0$ and so at this point, 
$$ \partial_t f_\epsilon \le 0, \Delta f_\epsilon \ge 0$$
(We use also that $M$ has no boundary to conclude the second inequality). Thus $(\partial_t -\Delta )f_\epsilon \le 0$, which is impossible. Thus $f_\epsilon \ge 0$ and so $f\ge -\epsilon T$. Then $f\ge 0$ by taking $\epsilon \to 0$. </p>

<p>Now note that both $H, \phi\ge H_{min}(0)&gt;0$. Thus $g = H-\phi$ satisfies</p>

<p>$$(\partial_t -\Delta )g \ge \frac{1}{n}g (H^2 + H\phi + \phi^2) \ge Cg$$</p>

<p>for $C= \frac{3}{n}H^2_{min}(0)$. Then $f = e^{-Ct}g$ satisfies 
$$(\partial_t -\Delta)f \ge 0$$
and $f\ge 0$ at $t=0$. So the weak maximum principle implies $f\ge 0$ for all time $t\in [0,T]$ and so $H\ge \phi$. </p>

That the same set but reading them as base $10$ expansions we now have a subset of the reals with the same cardinality as the reals.  Your set is between the two. </p>

"2383433","2384035","<p>Since $|A|^2 = \sum_i^n \kappa_i^2$ and $H = \sum_i^n \kappa_i$ we have $H^2 \le n |A|^2$. Thus we have $$|A|^2H - |A|^2 = |A|^2 (H-1) \ge \frac 1 n \left(H^3 - H^2\right)$$ whenever $H-1 \ge 0.$ </p>

<p>Thus the comparison principle for parabolic PDE gives $H \ge \varphi$ for $\varphi$ any solution of $\varphi'(t) = \frac 1 n \left( \varphi^3 - \varphi^2 \right)$ with $\varphi(0) \le \inf H(\cdot,0)$, <em>so long as $\varphi - 1 \ge 0.$</em> </p>

<p>Since this inequality is true by assumption at the initial time, we now just need to show that it is preserved by the ODE. As $F(\varphi) = \frac 1 n \left( \varphi^3 - \varphi^2 \right)$ is locally Lipschitz near $1$ and $\varphi(t) = 1$ is a solution, the uniqueness theorem tells us that a solution that is initially $\ge 1$ cannot fail to be so at a later time.</p>

"2383457","2383652","<p>I honestly think it makes no difference.</p>

<p>Although ""let"" and ""Suppose"" have different meanings, their logical conclusions are the same.</p>

<p>""let"" means assign an concrete instance.  However, this instance must be <em>general</em> and have no specific known characteristics.  Therefore anything we can conclude from the specific instance with no known characteristics, would have to be a conclusion that applies to any other hypothetical instance.  So ""let"" $\implies$ ""suppose"".</p>

<p>And likewise ""suppose"" means to take a hypothetical instance and then reach a general conclusion that applies to all instances.  So it applies to all specific instances.  So ""suppose"" $\implies$ ""let"".</p>

<p>For style I'd say ""Suppose $x_1$ and $x_2$ are linearly dependent and let $c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 = 0$"".  We are trying to prove something in all hypothetical cases, but we are using a equation to get a specific result which we apply to all cases.</p>

<p>But honestly, <em>no-one</em> will notice and even if they did, they could not deny that the logic of any choice would work.</p>

<p>=====</p>

<p>On the other hand, it could be argued ""let"" and ""suppose"" are  not  significantly different.</p>

<p>If we are walking through a forest full of vectors and we trip over a pair, $x_1$ and $x_2$, and it just so happens they are linearly independent.  That is ""suppose"".</p>

<p>If instead we get on our hands and knees and pick a pair, $w_3$ and $y_7$ and they are not linearly independent so we throw them away, and we keep searching until we find $x_1$ and $x_2$ that are linearly independent and we say ""you'll do"".  That's ""let"".</p>

<p>In both cases, though, we end up with the same thing; a pair of linearly independent vectors.</p>

<p>=========</p>

<p>By the way, this isn't pertinent to you question, if your definition of linear independence is: $\{x_i\}$ are linearly independent if--- $\sum c_i x_i = 0 \iff c_i = 0$, then you do not need the second ""let/suppose $c_1zx_1 + c_2zx_2 =0$"".</p>

<p>We'd simply say: Let/suppose $x_1$ and $x_2$ are linearly independent.  Then $c_1zx_1 + c_2zx_2 = 0 \iff c_iz = 0 \iff c_i= 0$.   So $zx_1$ and $zx_2$ are linearly independent.</p>

Similarly, you could construct a potential function away from the $x = 0$ plane.</p>

<p>The vector field above is closed (i.e. $\nabla\times\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{0}$), but a closed vector field is not necessarily conservative. The converse is true in two dimensions if the domain of definition of the vector field is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_connected_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">simply connected</a> and in three dimensions if the domain of definition is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractible_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">contractible</a>, but $\Bbb R^3\setminus\{z\textrm{-axis}\}$ (the domain of $\mathbf{F}$) is not simply connected (hence not contractible), so even though the vector field is closed, it need not be conservative.

"2383499","2383604","<h3>Version 1: incorrect form of Lipschitz continuity</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>for all $x_1,x_2\in K$, $\|F_1-F_2\|\le L\|x_1-x_2\|$ holds for all $F_1\in F(x_1)$ and $F_2\in F(x_2)$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implies $\|F_1-F_2\| = 0$ for all $F_1,F_2\in F(x_1)$. So the map $F$ is actually single-valued. The set-valued upper semicontinuity then becomes regular continuity of $F$.  </p>

<p>The latter still takes a bit of effort to prove since we only have the Lipschitz property on compact subsets. It goes like this: pick any convergent sequence $x_n\to x$. The set $K=\{x_n\}\cup \{x\}$ is compact, so $f$ is Lipschitz continuous on it. Hence $f(x_n)\to f(x)$. Since we are in a metric space,  sequential continuity is equivalent to continuity.</p>

<h3>Version 2: Lipschitz continuity with respect to Hausdorff distance</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>For any $x\in X$ and for any compact subset $K\subset X$ containing $x$, there exists $L&gt;0$ such that $\forall x_1,x_2\in K$, $F(x_1)\subset F(x_2) + B_{L\|x_1-x_2\|}$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This does not imply upper semicontinuity. For example, let $F(x) = (x,x+1)\subset \mathbb R$ for $x\in \mathbb{R}$. The <a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/a/131209"">definition of upper semicontinuity</a> says that for every open set $W\subset Y$, the set $\{x\in X: F(x)\subset W\}$ must be open in $X$. But this fails with $W=(0,1)$ for which the latter set is $\{0\}$. </p>

<p>Aside: The definition of upper semicontinuity makes more sense for maps such that $F(x)$ is compact for every $x$, or at least closed. </p>

<h3>Version 3: Lipschitz continuity with respect to Hausdorff distance, compact-valued map</h3>

<p>Suppose $F(x)$ is compact for every $x$, and is globally Lipschitz in the Hausdorff metric. (Not just Lipschitz on each compact set). Then upper semicontinuity holds. Indeed, take an open set $W\subset Y$ and a point $x_0$ such that $F(x_0)\subset W$. Let $\rho = \operatorname{dist}(F(x_0), Y\setminus W) $, which is a positive number. If $d(x,x_0)&lt;\rho/L$, then the Lipschitz condition on $F$ implies $F(x)\subset W$, as required for upper semicontinuity.</p>

"2383503","2384057","<p>This would be very unusual, for two important reasons.</p>

<p>First, <em>models in sets are not enough</em>. It is important to consider <em>large</em> categories, such as <strong>Set</strong> or <strong>AbGrp</strong> or <strong>Top</strong> or <strong>Cat</strong>.</p>

<p>Secondly, category theory develops its own take on first-order logic &mdash; it would be a wasted effort (and somewhat counter-philosophical) to study the subject in the traditional set-oriented version of logic.</p>

<p>However, one <em>does</em> study categories as models &mdash; we call such a thing an <em>internal categories</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Regarding your specific note on natural transformations, there are several paths that might lead you there.</p>

<p>The first is that you can show the product has a right adjoint, so that there is a natural bijection</p>

<p>$$ \hom(\mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{D}, \mathcal{E}) \cong \hom(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{E}^{\mathcal{D}}) $$</p>

<p>This means that you can treat $\mathcal{D}^\mathcal{C}$ as the <em>category</em> of morphisms from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{D}$. A natural transformation, then, is an arrow in this category.</p>

<p>A similar phenomenon happens, for example, in abelian groups, which allows you to construct the <em>abelian group</em> of morphisms from one group to another.</p>

<p>Now, assuming you didn't think to show that, one can still draw <em>inspiration</em> from it; since arrows can be viewed as morphisms $\hom(\uparrow, \mathcal{C})$, where $\uparrow$ means the arrow category, even if you didn't know that $\mathcal{E}^\mathcal{D}$ existed, one can still draw inspiration from the idea of the adjunction above and define a natural transformation to be a morphism $\uparrow \times \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$.</p>

"2383508","2383531","<p>As already noted we want $$\frac{3x-1}{x+2}&gt;0$$  Now a rational function can only change sign at a zero or vertical asymptote, so we see any sign changes can only occur at the zero of the numerator $x=\frac{1}{3}$ or the zero of the denominator $x=-2$.  Since both of these zeros have multiplicity 1 which is odd, the function will change sign.  We need to look at the intervals $(-\infty, -2)$, $(-2,\frac{1}{3})$, and $(\frac{1}{3}, \infty)$.  If we choose a test value such as $x=0$ we find $$\frac{3\cdot 0-1}{0+2}=\frac{-1}{2}&lt;0$$  Using the observation from above that the function will change sign at $x=\frac{1}{3}$ and $x=-2$ tells us that the domain is $(-\infty, -2)\cup (\frac{1}{3}, \infty)$.

Each edge represents <em>multiplying by the same generator (element)</em> but each vertex represents a <strong><em>different</strong> element of the group</em>. So this particular diagram represents the group $C_6$ (some people write it as $(\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z})$ or $\mathbb{Z}_6$). This group consists of six elements:</p>

<p>$$C_6=\{ [0], [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] \}$$</p>

<p>and has the binary operation of <em>addition modulus 6</em>, that is, $[1]+[3]=[4]$ but $[2]+[4]=[0]$, since $1+3 \equiv 4 \ (\text{mod} \ 6)$ but $2+4 \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ 6)$.</p>

<p>Anyways, this group has a special property concerning the element $[1]$. Particularly, we can represent every element in the group with $[1]$! Let's let $[1]$ be $x$. Then:</p>

"2383714","2384277","<p>Yes, they are all similar.

"
"2383716","2383942","<p>It's trivial that $R = I_1 + I_2 + \cdots + I_n$, why? because a sequence with $R$ runs must have $R$ positions where each run starts, if there are 3 runs, there must exist 3 positions in the sequence where each of them starts. For example the runs at S,S,S,F,S,S,F,F,S start at positions 1,5, and 8, meaning $I_1 = I_5 = I_8 = 1$, the rest of the $I_j$'s are zero. Obviously $P(R=n) = 0$ because for there to exist at least 2 runs, there must be failures in between, which means at least one $I_j = 0$.
Now you can calculate the expectation of $R$
$$ E(R) = E(I_1 + I_2 + \cdots + I_n) = E(I_1) + E(I_2) + \cdots + E(I_n) $$
The problem has been reduced to finding the expected value of each $I_j$ and summing over all of them. You have two cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>$P(I_1=1) = p$, where $p$ is the probability of success of the Bernoulli trials, and</li>
<li>$P(I_j=1) = (1-p)p$ where $j \neq 1$, because if $j$ is not the first position, there must exist a failure in the previous position $(1-p)$, and a success at position j $(p)$. Therefore
\begin{align*}
E(R) &amp; = E(I_1 + I_2 + \cdots + I_n)\\
&amp; = E(I_1) + E(I_2) + \cdots + E(I_n)\\
&amp; = p + (1-p)p + \cdots + (1-p)p\\
&amp; = p + (n-1)(1-p)p  
\end{align*}
For example, if $n = 3$ and $p = 0.5$ you have $8$ possible outcomes with equal probability each:
$$
FFF \to 0 \text{ runs}\\
FFS \to 1 \text{ runs}\\
FSF \to 1 \text{ runs}\\
FSS \to 1 \text{ runs}\\
SFF \to 1 \text{ runs}\\
SFS \to 2 \text{ runs}\\
SSF \to 1 \text{ runs}\\
SSS \to 1 \text{ runs}
$$
Therefore the expected number of runs is:
$$ \frac{(0+1+1+1+1+2+1+1)}{8} = \frac{8}{8} = 1$$
Using the previous formula yields the same result (but quicker):
$$ \operatorname{E}(R) = p + (n-1)(1-p)p = 0.5 + (3-1)\times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 1$$</li>

"2383721","2383916","<p>Rudin's theorem stops one step short of constructing the coordinates that I construct. To get my result from his, the first thing to do is to choose bases in $\mathbb R^n$ and $\mathbb R^m$ such that $A$ is given by

A\big(x^1,\dots,x^n\big) = \big(x^1,\dots,x^r,0,\dots,0\big).
$$
(Theorem B.20 in my Appendix B shows that this can always be done for a linear map of rank $r$.) Then you can choose the complementary subspace $Y_2$ to
be the set of points of the form $\big(0,\dots,0,x^{r+1},\dots,x^n\big)$,
and $P$ is just the coordinate projection 
$$\big(x^1,\dots,x^m\big)\mapsto

F\circ H(x) = \big( x^1,\dots, x^r,\varphi^{r+1}\big( x^1,\dots, x^r\big),\dots,
\varphi^m\big( x^1,\dots, x^r\big)\big),
$$
where $\big(\varphi^{r+1},\dots,\varphi^m\big)$ are the coordinate functions of the map $\varphi$.

<p>To get the coordinates in my version of the theorem, define new coordinates on a neighborhood of $0$ in $\mathbb R^m$ by $y=\Psi(x)$, where

<li>For $l=10$:  $|S \setminus \bar{S}|=45 &lt; |\bar{S}|=46$ , $\max(S)=100$</li>
</ul>

<p>As the sets become rather large I left out the lasts few examples. These are the first sets I encountered in the following procedure.</p>

<p>We start for the chosen value of $l$ with the set $S=\{1,2,\dots,l-1\}$ which does not contain an arithmetic sequence of length $l$. (Optional $\bar{S}=\{l-1\}$). We also use an index $n=l$. Now we can use the following algorithm:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add $n$ to the set $S$</p></li>
<li><p>Check wether there is any arithmetic sequence of length $l$ in $S$ that ends in $n$. If that is the case we remove $n$ from $S$, if not we have a new set that does not contain any arithmetic sequences of length $l$ or longer.</p></li>
<li><p>Optional: If $n$ was accepted we can check whether there is any arithmetic sequence of length $l-1$ in $S$ that ends in $n$. If that is so, we add $n$ to $\bar{S}$.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase $n$ by one and go back to step 1.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After that it is only repeating until the number of elements in $\bar{S}$ exceeds half the size of $S$.</p>

<p>I have not tried to prove the existence of such a set for any value of $l$, but I see no obvious reason why they would seize to exist for larger values of $l$. It should also be noted that there might very well be sets with the required properties that are smaller in size and of which the largest element in $S$ is less than the algorithm above gives. </p>

<p>It is, however, possible to construct a set for any value of $l$ in a systematic fashion. Hereto we start with the following sets:
$$S_0 = {1}$$
$$\bar{S}_0 = \emptyset$$
and apply the following iterative scheme:
$$S_{n+1} = \cup_{k=0}^{l-1} \left[ S_n + k \Delta_n \right]$$
$$S_{n+1} = \cup_{k=0}^{l-2} \left[ \bar{S}_n + k \Delta_n \right] \cup \left[S_n + (l-1) \Delta_n\right]$$
where $\Delta_n$ is not unique but should be large enough to avoid any problems with generating additional sequences. It is sufficient to choose $\Delta_n \geq 2 \max(S_{n-1})-1$. </p>

<p>We find that
$$|S_n| = l^n$$
$$|\bar{S}_n| = l^n - (l-1)^n$$
and if we choose
$$\Delta_n = (2l-1)^{n-1}$$
the largest element in $S_n$ is given by
$$\max(S_n) = \frac{(2 l-1)^n +1}{2}$$.</p>

<p>From this it follows that for $|S_n\setminus \bar{S}_n| &lt; |\bar{S}_n|$ we require $(l-1)^n &lt; l^n - (l-1)^n$, which means
$$n&gt;- \frac{\ln 2}{\ln(1- \frac{1}{l})}$$.</p>

<p>For the case $l=3$ we would obtain the set 
$$S=\{1,2,3,~~6,7,8,~~11,12,13\}$$
and for $l=4$ we get
$$S=\left\{\begin{array}{llll}
1,2,3,4, &amp; 8,9,10,11, &amp; 15,16,17,18, &amp; 22,23,24,25,\\
50,51,52,53, &amp; 57,58,59,60,&amp; 64,65,66,67, &amp; 71,72,73,74,\\
99,100,101,102,&amp;106,107,108,109,&amp;113,114,115,116,&amp; 120,121,122,123,\\
148,149,150,151,&amp;155,156,157,158,&amp;162,163,164,165,&amp; 169,170,171,172
\end{array} \right\}$$.</p>

<p>And finally, we get that
$$\frac{|\bar{S}_n|}{|S_n|} = 1 - \left( 1 - \frac{1}{l}\right)^n$$
and hence 
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{|\bar{S}_n|}{|S_n|} = 1.$$</p>

$$ f(x) := \frac{x^2}{|x|}, $$
which is not defined at zero.  On the other hand, the function
$$ g(x) := |x| $$
is defined for all real values of $x$, and $f(x) = g(x)$ whenever both functions are defined.  Thus it is reasonable to ""extend"" $f$ to all real numbers by setting $f(0) = 0$.  In this way, we can reasonably say that

<p>At the suggestion of Henning Makholm, let us note that this $g$ is in no way unique.  I could just as easily have remarked that

We would like to extend $f$ to a function on $\mathbb{R}$ in the ""nicest possible way.""

"2383834","2384086","<p>(b) If countably many values are allowed, the tail of the Fourier transform can be heavier than $|\omega|^{-1}$. Indeed, if $f(x) = |x|^{-\alpha}$ with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1/2$ near zero (and is truncated at infinity), the Fourier transform will behave like $|\omega|^{\alpha-1}$ at infinity. (Why? The decay of Fourier transform is controlled by $\|\tau_{1/\omega} f - f\|_1$ where $\tau$ is the translation operator. Translating $|x|^{-\alpha}$ by $1/\omega$ and subtracting cancels off some of it, but it leaves a neighborhood of size $1/|\omega|$ around $0$ without much cancellation, and this neighborhood contributes $|1/\omega|^{-\alpha+1}$ to the $L^1$ norm.)</p>

"2383969","2383986","<p>From what I understand you're comparing two lists of numbers.</p>

<p>The Euclidian distance seems like a good method (which is equivalent to the normalized Euclidian distance, you just scale it down to $[0,1]$).</p>

<p>The Chi square method is quite similar to the Euclidian distance but it punishes relative difference instead of absolute :</p>

<p>For example, let's have : $h_1=[1,10]$ and $h_2=[2,11]$.</p>

<p>In this example the Euclian method will treat the difference between ($1$ and $2$) and ($10$ and $11$) the same, whereas the chi method will consider the difference between $1$ and $2$ to be more significant than the one between $10$ and $11$. </p>

<p>That's up to you to decide which one you prefer. </p>

<p><del>You can discard the intersections as they really have no value, as is, in your case.</del></p>

<p>Another simple metric you could use is this one :</p>

<p>$$d = \sum_n|h1_i-h2_i|$$</p>

<p>This one, and the euclidian metric, are classic metrics in mathematic. The main difference between those two is the euclidian method will punish a lot more a large difference.</p>

<p>As for the code, are you sure you can't fix those square by any methods ? Also, for the normalized euclidian, you might want to assign a variable to <code>len(h1)</code> outside the loop instead of searching for it each iteration.</p>

<p>EDIT : As I read deeper into your references, I think I might have overlooked the intersection method. Can you explain a little bit more what you're trying to achieve by comparing the two histograms ?</p>

<p>Thus $$JH-HJ=(\lambda_1-\lambda_2)\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; h_{12} \\

are zeros. On the other hand, 
$(JH-HJ)^2=O_2$ provided one of the numbers $\lambda_1-\lambda_2$, $h_{12}$, and $h_{21}$ is zero. But if none of them is zero then 
$$-a\lambda_1-b\lambda_2+ h_{11}+h_{22}=0$$ and 
$$-a\lambda_2-b\lambda_1+ h_{11}+h_{22}=0.$$ Thus 
$$-a\lambda_1-b\lambda_2=-a\lambda_2-b\lambda_1,$$ or  </p>

<p>In particular $h_{21}(-(a+b)\lambda + h_{11}+h_{22})$ is zero. On the other hand, it is easy to check that $(JH-HJ)^2=O_2$ iff $h_{21}$ is zero. But $h_{21}$ is not zero then 
$$(a+b)\lambda=h_{11}+h_{22}.$$</p>

"2384135","2384140","<p>Note that $(a,b)$ and $(b,c)$ are the only two pairs that have matching middle terms ($b$ in this case). Thus, in order for the relation to be transitive, it must contain $(a,c)$ - which it does. Therefore it is transitive.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>In general, to test if a relation is transitive, we need to grab all possible pairs in the relation (meaning pairs of pairs) that have matching middle terms. Then, one by one, look to see if the term required by transitivity is present. If any such terms are not, then the relation is not transitive. For a more complicated example, consider the relation</p>

<p>$$ R = \{(a,a),(a,b),(a,c),(a,e),(b,c),(b,e),(c,d) \}.
$$
We find all pairs of elements with matching middle terms. They are:
$$ (a,a)\ \text{and}\ (a,b) \\
(a,a)\ \text{and}\ (a,c) \\
(a,a)\ \text{and}\ (a,e) \\
(a,b)\ \text{and}\ (b,c) \\
(a,b)\ \text{and}\ (b,e) \\
(a,c)\ \text{and}\ (c,d) \\
(b,c)\ \text{and}\ (c,d)
$$
Now, test them one by one until we either find a failure or terminate the whole list.
$$ (a,a)\ \text{and}\ (a,b) \implies \text{need}\ (a,b)\ \checkmark \\
(a,a)\ \text{and}\ (a,c) \implies \text{need}\ (a,c)\ \checkmark \\
(a,a)\ \text{and}\ (a,e) \implies \text{need}\ (a,e)\ \checkmark \\
(a,b)\ \text{and}\ (b,c) \implies \text{need}\ (a,c)\ \checkmark \\
(a,b)\ \text{and}\ (b,e) \implies \text{need}\ (a,e)\ \checkmark \\
(a,c)\ \text{and}\ (c,d) \implies \text{need}\ (a,d)\times \\
$$
Thus we find that $R$ is not transitive and there is no need to check the pair. Note that we also could have made our list shorter by not considering the reflexive term $(a,a)$.</p>

We now wish to prove that $S_n$ converges to $1$ when $r&gt;1$; to this end,  let $\epsilon &gt; 0$ be given, and let $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $N&gt; \frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\log(r)} \implies \frac{1}{r^N} &lt; \epsilon$<br>

$$|S_n - 1| = \left|\frac{1}{1+r^{-n}} - 1\right| = \left|\frac{-r^{-n}}{1+r^{-n}}\right| = \frac{r^{-n}}{1+r^{-n}}=\frac{1}{1+r^n}&lt;\frac{1}{r^n} &lt;\frac{1}{r^N}&lt;\epsilon$$

"2384176","2384201","<p>Short answer: You were assuming that some ""x"" symbols were the multiplication symbol $\times$. In fact, each is the variable $x$.</p>

<p>Long answer: The symbol ""x"" is confusing because it can stand for two things: multiplication $\times$ and the variable $x$. </p>

<p>In more advanced math courses, people tend not to* use the $\times$ symbol for multiplication. Instead, they use one of two methods. First, the dot $\cdot$. So, you'd write $2\cdot 3 = 6$ instead of $ 2 \times 3 = 6$. Second, using parentheses. So, you'd write $2(3) = 6$, $(2)3 = 6$ or $(2)(3) = 6$ (all are equivalent) instead of $2 \times 3 = 6$.</p>

<p>This notation is useful when you work with the variable $x$. Note that $2x \cdot 3 = 6x$ and $(2x)3$ are much more legible than $2x \times 3 = 6x$, especially when you're writing these expressions by hand. Personally, I recommend using $\cdot$ or parentheses for multiplication whenever you're doing algebra with the variable $x$. It will help you avoid confusing $\times$ and $x$. </p>

<p>Now, back to your question. Let's look at example 1. You want to expand the expression <code>8x(x+3)</code> using the distributive property. You were interpreting this as $8\times (x + 3)$, so the first ""x"" was multiplication $\times$ and the second ""x"" was the variable $x$. But actually, the question is asking about $8x(x+3) = 8x \cdot (x+3)$. <strong>In these given examples, none of the ""x"" symbols stand for multiplication. They're all variables.</strong></p>

<p>To solve the problem, you just split up the left and right side, exactly as you said. Here's the solution you supplied in your question, rewritten for clarity using the $\cdot$ notation:</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
8x \cdot (x+3) &amp;= 8x \cdot x + 8x \cdot 3 \\
&amp;= 8x^2 + 24x
\end{align*}</p>

<p>Does this help?</p>

<p>*Footnote so nobody yells at me: The $\times$ symbol actually is used in advanced math for special purposes. For example, the cross product (product of two vectors) and Cartesian product (product of two sets) use the symbol. Since vectors and sets rarely use the symbol $x$, using the $\times$ symbol is ok here.</p>

"2384188","2384743","<p>Assume that a given looped sequence $\{A_n\}$ can be described by a pair of integers $(p,b)$ and the relation
$$
A_n = A_0 p^n + n \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} p^k \mod M.
$$
The first thing to note is that we have a recurrence relation:
$$
A_{n+1} = p A_n + b \mod M
$$
and it follows that the same $(p,b)$ combination would be found wherever we start in the loop. The first three elements of the loop are:
$$A_0$$
$$A_1 = p A_0 + b$$
$$A_2 = p A_1 + b$$
and we can combine them to obtain
$$A_2 - 2 A_1 + A_0 = (A_2-A_1) - (A_1-A_0) = (p-1) (A_1 - A_0) $$
$$A_1^2 - A_2 A_0 = A_1(p A_0 +b) - (p A_1 + b) A_0 = b (A_1-A_0)$$
This gives us the two congruence equations:
$$A_2 - 2 A_1 + A_0  \equiv (p-1) (A_1 - A_0) \mod M$$
$$A_1^2 -A_1 A_0  \equiv b (A_1 - A_0) \mod M$$

$$A_2 - 2 A_1 + A_0 \equiv A_1^2 - A_2 A_0 \equiv 0 \mod \gcd(M,A_1-A_0)$$

"2384297","2384574","<p>The Fourier series of the function $f(x)$ is given by

$$
with 
$$
c_n = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi d x~f(x) e^{-\imath n x}
$$
In the case $f(x) = |\sin x |$, this results in
$$
c_n = 2 \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^\pi d x~\sin x e^{-\imath n x} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} -\frac{2}{\pi (n^2-1)} &amp; \text{for $n$ even}\\ 0 &amp; \text{for $n$ odd} \end{array} \right.

Using Parsifal's identity we have
$$
\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty |c_n|^2 = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi d x ~ |\sin x|^2 = \frac{1}{2}
$$
Since $c_{n} = c_{-n}$ the sum on the left hand side can be rewritten as
$$
c_0^2 + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n^2 = \frac{1}{2}
$$
From which it follows that with $c_0=\frac{2}{\pi}$
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2} - c_0^2\right) = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{2}{\pi^2}
$$
Using the result we found for $c_n$ we get
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n^2 = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_{2 n - 1}^2 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_{2 n}^2 = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_{2 n}^2 = \frac{4}{\pi^2} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(4 n^2 -1)^2}
$$
and therefore we finally obtain
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(4 n^2 -1)^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{4} \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{2}{\pi^2} \right) = \frac{\pi^2-8}{16}

"2384445","2384467","<p>Indeed, you can't use Yoneda in <em>that</em> spot; but $C(W\cdot F,\sim)\to Set^{J^{op}}(W,C(F-,\sim))$ <em>is</em> the right way around to use Yoneda. If you look at the formula that follows the mention of Yoneda on the nLab page, $$W(j)\to C(F(j),W\cdot F)$$ you'll see that this is precisely signature of the morphism associated with $id_{W\cdot F}$.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> After thinking about this for a few minutes, perhaps your confusion is that you think the isomorphism $$C(W\cdot F,c)\cong Set^{J^{op}}(W,C(F-,c))$$ is intended to be something like the isomorphism $$W(j)\cong Set^{J^{op}}(J(-,j),W).$$ This is not the case. The claim is not that the former isomorphism is an instance of Yoneda; if it were, weighted colimits would be uninteresting because they would be an intrinsic part of every category. Rather, the existence of the former is the substantial fact that a particular set-valued functor is representable; its existence has nothing to do with Yoneda. The instance of Yoneda invoked in the nLab article is rather $$Set^{J^{op}}(W,C(F-,W\cdot F))\cong Set^C(C(W\cdot F,\sim),Set^{J^{op}}(W,C(F-,\sim))),$$ which is used to state that there is a universal arrow $\phi$ from $W$ to $$C(F-,\sim):C\to Set^{J^{op}}.$$</p>

<p>Notice that this is entirely analogous to the isomorphism $$C(\mathrm{colim}\;F,-)\cong C^D(F,\Delta-)$$ (where $F:D\to C$ and $\Delta:C\to C^D$ is the diagonal functor), where Yoneda tells us that the existence of this isomorphism gives rise to a unique $\xi:F\to\Delta(\mathrm{colim}\; F)$--i.e., the colimiting cone.</p>

  <p>From my understanding for all statements $E(x_1, \dots, x_n)$, whose parameters are in an arbitrary collection $X$, it should <em>trivially</em> follow that $X$ agrees with $E(x_1, \dots, x_n)$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, not at all.  I think you perhaps have a misunderstanding: using parameters doesn't mean you can't <em>also</em> have other variables that are quantified.  For a very simple example, let $a$ be any set and $X=\{a\}$.  Let $E(x)$ be the statement $\exists y[x\in y]$.  Then $E(a)$ is true (take $y=\{a\}$) but $E^X(a)$ is false (since $a\not\in a$).</p>

<p>Note also that any statement without free variables is also a ""statement with parameters in $X$"".  Its number $n$ of parameters just happens to be $0$.  Or, you can consider it as a statement with any number of parameters, except that its parameters don't actually occur anywhere in it (so their value does not affect the truth of the statement).  The operative part of the phrase ""with parameters in $X$"" is ""in $X$"": you are not allowed to make parameters take values that are not in $X$.</p>

  <p>Is
  $$E = \forall x\exists y[P(x) \in y]$$ a statement that doesn't agree with, say, $V_3$, where $V_\alpha$ is the von Neumann stage of order $\alpha$, but agrees with, say, $V_\omega$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one is actually a bit subtle.  The problem is that ""$P(x)$"" is not actually a valid term in the language of set theory.  Rather, the expression $z=P(x)$ is an abbreviation for $$\forall w[w\in z\Leftrightarrow\forall v[v\in w\Rightarrow v\in x]].$$  If you want to express your statement $E$ in the language of set theory, there are a few different ways you can do it, which are equivalent in the universe but not necessarily when relativized to a set $X$.  For instance, you might write $E$ as $$\forall x\exists y\forall z[z=P(x)\Rightarrow z\in y]$$ (where $z=P(x)$ is an abbreviation as above).  Or you might write it as $$\forall x\exists y\exists z[z=P(x)\wedge z\in y].$$  These two statements are equivalent in the universe, since for any $x$, there is a unique $z$ which satisfies $z=P(x)$.  However, in a set like $X=\{a\}$, they are not equivalent: the first is true, since taking $x=a$, there does not exist any $z\in X$ such that $(z=P(a))^X$ is true, so $\forall z[z=P(a)\Rightarrow z\in y]$ is vacuously true (and we can set $y=a$).  But for the exact same reason, the second is false.</p>

<p>As for your question, it turns out that actually both versions are true in $V_\omega$ and false in $V_3$, so both statements agree with $V_\omega$ but not with $V_3$.  Even the first version fails in $V_3$ because if you set $x=\{\emptyset\}$, then $z=P(x)$ is an element of $V_3$ but it is not an element of any element of $V_3$.</p>

<p>To prove it, consider the set $S$ of all degrees $[E':F]$ of intermediate fields $E'\subset E$.  Then $S$ is a nonempty set of natural numbers, all of which are less than $[E:F]$.  Let $n$ be the greatest element of $S$, and choose $E'\subset E$ such that $[E':F]=n$.

To simplify the confusing notation, consider the event $$E:=\left\{y: U\le \frac{f(y)}{cg(y)}\right\}$$ (formally we would need some more notation to define this event). Hence, by Bayes rule (conditional probability) you have that $$P(E)=\sum_{y}P(E\mid y)P(Y=y)$$ However, here $Y$ is a continuous random variable, hence in the place of the summation sign $\sum$ you have an integral sign $\int$ and in the place of the probabilities $P(Y=y)$ you have the probability density function $g(y)$ (times the infitesimal $d(y)$), so the above expression becomes $$P(E)=\int P(E\mid y)g(y)dy$$ and putting back the definition of $E$ you get your expression. Note also, that you are right about the fact that $P\left(U\le f(y)/cg(y)\right)$ is an integral, so what you have, is indeed a double integral. You do away with the second integral in the step $$P\left(U\le \frac{f(y)}{cg(y)}\right)=\int_0^{\frac{f(y)}{cg(y)}}du=\left.u\right|_0^{\frac{f(y)}{cg(y)}}=\frac{f(y)}{cg(y)}-0=\frac{f(y)}{cg(y)}$$ </p>

<p>In order to profe the isoperimetric inequality in this form, you need to do the following:<br>

In the general case, you need to first show that the above implies that $M$ is convex.

"
"2384639","2385009","<p>From your description, I am not sure <em>exactly</em> what you are doing.
But maybe I can give you some helpful ideas.</p>

<p>1) For normal data, the standard CI for the population mean $\mu$ uses
Student's t distribution which is symmetrical. The 95% CI is of the
form $\bar X \pm t^*S/\sqrt{n},$ where $t^*$ cuts 2.5% from the upper
tail of $\mathsf{T}(\nu= n-1)$.</p>

<p>By contrast, the standard CI for the population variance $\sigma^2$ uses
the chi-squared distribution which is not symmetrical. The 95% CI is of
the form $\left(\frac{(n-1)S^2}{U}, \frac{(n-2)S^2}{L}\right),$ where
$L$ and $U$ cut 2.5% of the probability from the lower and upper tails,
respectively, of $\mathsf{Chisq}(\nu = n-1).$</p>

<p>Unless your bootstrapping procedure corrects for the bias in the case
of the variance (with its skewed distribition), you cannot expect an accurate result.</p>

<p>2) It is not exactly 'fair' to compare CIs (using Student's t and
chi-squared distributions) based on the assumption data are normal
with results of <em>nonparametric</em> bootstrap CIs. The assumption that
data are normal provides 'information' for the t and chi-squared
intervals that is not used in nonparametric bootstrapping.</p>

<p>3) In making bootstrap CIs for variation, I have found it better
to find CIs for $\sigma$ rather than $\sigma^2,$ possibly because the former
has the same units as the data.  Also, for scale parameters, I have found
that it often works better to bootstrap ratios rather than differences.</p>

<p>4) Finally, along lines of @HansEngler's suggestion, I will generate $n = 1000$ observations from $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu = 100, \sigma=15),$ find the chi-sqared CI for $\sigma$ and compare it with
a bias-corrected nonparametric bootstrap. </p>

<p>First, here are my fake data and the corresponding
standard CI for $\sigma,$  which turns out to be $(9.55, 10.43).$
[I have provided <code>set.seed</code> statements, so that you can replicate
the exact simulations I have used.]</p>

<pre><code>set.seed(1234)
n = 1000;  mu = 100;  sg = 10;  x = rnorm(n, mu, sg)
a = mean(x); s = sd(x);  a;  s
## 99.73403    # sample mean
## 9.973377    # sample SD
# CI for sg
UL = qchisq(c(.975,.025), 999); UL
## 1088.487  913.301
sqrt((n-1)*var(x)/UL)
##  9.554619 10.430810  # CI for sg (includes 9.973, as it must)
</code></pre>

<p>Now for the (bias corrected) nonparametric bootstrap CI: I will bootstrap the <em>ratio</em>
$R = S/\sigma.$ If I knew the distribution of $R,$ then I could find
$L$ and $U$ with $P(L \le R = S/\sigma \le U) = 0.95$ so that 
$P(S/U \le \sigma \le S/L) = .95$ and a 95%
CI for $\sigma$ would be of the form $(S/U,\, S/L).$ By bootstrapping
$R,\,$ I can estimate $U$ and $L.$  I use
the observed $s = 9.97$ temporarily as a proxy for unknown $\sigma.$
Suffixes <code>.re</code> indicate bootstrapped quantities. [On this site
with relatively few experienced R users,
I try to use only the most fundamental R functions; I will leave it
to you to write more elegant R code, which is obviously possible.]  </p>

<pre><code>set.seed(1235)
B = 10^5;  r = numeric(B)
for(i in 1:B) {
  s.re = sd(sample(x,n,repl=T))
  r[i] = s.re/s }
L.re = quantile(r, .025);  U.re = quantile(r, .975)
c(s/U.re, s/L.re)  
##    97.5%      2.5% 
## 9.537866 10.462202 
</code></pre>

<p>So the nonparametric bootstrap CI is $(9.54, 10.46),$ which
is not a bad match for the standard chi-squared CI $(9.55, 10.43)$
obtained above. [The large sample size ($n$ = 1000) has mostly
obviated my comment in (2) above, which still stands for smaller $n$.
Even so, it is possible that the information that the data are normal
accounts for the fact that the normal-based CI is a bit shorter.]</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> If you do a <em>parametric</em> bootsrap CI, you may get
closer to the result for the chi-squared CI. In parametric
bootstrapping, one re-samples from a parametric distribution (here normal)
with parameters <em>suggested by</em> the data (rather than from the data themselves). 
In particular, in the code above one would substitute the code 
<code>s.re = sd(rnorm(n, a, s))</code> for the line with <code>sample</code>. With this change
and bootstrap seed 1066, I got the 95% <em>parametric bootstrap</em> CI $(9.55, 10.43).$</p>

"2384689","2384762","<p>The fundamental group must be countable in your situation. Here's a proof, which has a good visualization in my head from which I concocted it, although in the end its easier to write out the proof than to draw the picture.</p>

<p>From your hypotheses, $X$ has a countable basis $\{U_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ consisting of path connected open sets for which the inclusion induced homomorphism $\pi_1(U_i) \to \pi_1(X)$ is trivial. Also, given two basis elements $U_i,U_j$, their intersection consists of countably many path components, denote them 
$$U_i \cap U_j = \cup_{k=1}^\infty V_{ij}^k
$$
Pick points $p_i \in U_i$ and $q_{ij}^k \in V_{ij}^k$. Declare one of the $p$'s to be the base point, say $p_1 \in U_1$.</p>

<p>For any closed path $\gamma : [0,1] \to X$ based at $p_1$, by the Lebesgue number lemma we may subdivide
$$0=x_0 &lt; x_1 &lt; ... &lt; x_M=1
$$
so that for each $m=1,...,M$ the path $\gamma[x_{m-1},x_m]$ has image in one of the $U_i$'s, call it $U_{i_m}$. We'll assume $i_1=i_M=1$.</p>

<p>Let's do a preliminary path homotopy on $\gamma$, which will achieve the following effect: denoting $y_m = \frac{x_{m-1}+x_m}{2}$ which is the midpoint of the interval $[x_{m-1},x_m]$, we may assume that $\gamma(y_m) = p_{i_m}$ for $2 \le m \le M-1$. To achieve this, cut $\gamma$ at $y_m$ and then insert a new path which first travels along some path in $U_{i_m}$ from $\gamma(y_m)$ to $p_{i_m}$ and then backwards along the same path.</p>

<p>Next, note that we have a nonempty intersection $U_{i_{m-1}} \cap U_{i_m} \ne \emptyset$ because that set contains the point $\gamma(x_m)$. Let $V_{i_{m-1} i_m}^{k_m}$ be the path component of that intersection that contains $\gamma(x_m)$.</p>

<p>Now I'll construct a countable collection of closed ""model paths"" based at $p_1$, and I'll pick out one of those paths which is path homotopic to $\gamma$.</p>

<p>For each $i,j,k$ such that $V_{ij}^k \ne \emptyset$ let $\delta_{ij}^k$ be the concatenation of a path in $U_i$ from $p_i$ to $q_{ij}^k$ with a path in $U_j$ from $q_{ij}^k$ to $p_j$. Since the inclusions from $U_i$ and $U_j$ into $X$ induce trivial maps on fundamental groups, it follows that the path homotopy class of $\delta_{ij}^k$ is well-defined. There are countably many of the $\delta$'s, and so the collection of paths obtained by concatenating a finite sequence of the $\delta$'s is countable. These are the ""model paths"".</p>

<p>So now we just have to show that $\gamma$ is path homotopic to the path
$$\delta_{i_1i_2}^{k_2} * ... * \delta_{i_{m-1}i_m}^{k_m}
$$
For that purpose, for each $m=1,...,M-1$ we pick a path $\eta_m$ in $V_{i_{m-1}i_m}^{k_m}$ from the point $\gamma(x_m)$ to the point $q_{i_{m-1}i_m}^{k_m}$, and then we cut $\gamma$ at $x_m$ and insert a copy of $\eta_m \bar\eta_m$. It follows that $\gamma$ is path homotopic to
$$\underbrace{(\gamma[x_0,x_1] \, \eta_1 \, \bar\eta_1 \, \gamma[x_1,y_2])}_{\delta_{i_1i_2}^{k_2}} * \underbrace{\gamma[y_2,x_2] \, \eta_2 \,  \bar\eta_2 \, \gamma[x_2, y_3])}_{\delta_{i_2i_3}^{k_3}} * ... * \underbrace{(\gamma[y_{m-1},x_{m-1}] \, \eta_{m-1} \, \bar\eta_{m-1}\, \gamma[x_{m-1,}x_m])}_{\delta_{i_{m-1}i_m}^{k_m}}

<p>According to the paper <em>An $L^p$-estimate for the gradient of solution of second order divergence equations</em> by Meyers (1963), <a href=""https://eudml.org/doc/83302"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://eudml.org/doc/83302</a>, the (weak) Laplacian is an isomorphism between $W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)\to W^{-1,p}(\Omega)$ for certain $p$. The result can be found in Theorems 1 and 2 on Page 198 by taking $A=\mathbf{I}$, the identity operator. Simplified (by using the characterization of $W^{-1,p}(\Omega)$), the theorem states the following:</p>

<p>Let $n\geq 2$ and let $\Omega$ be a <strong>bounded</strong> connected open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then there exists <strong>some</strong> $p_0 &gt; 2$ such that for all $p\in[2,p_0)$ we have that if $f\in W^{-1,p}(\Omega)$ then there is a unique weak solution, $u$, to $\Delta u = f$ with $u\in W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$ and there is a constant $C$ such that
$$\|u\|_{W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)}\leq C\|f\|_{W^{-1,p}(\Omega)}.$$
Hence $\Delta^{-1}:W^{-1,p}(\Omega)\to W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$ is well-defined, linear, and continuous. In particular, we deduce that $\Delta\circ \Delta^{-1} = \mathrm{id}_{W^{-1,p}(\Omega)}$ and $\Delta^{-1}\circ\Delta=\mathrm{id}_{W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)}$, with both maps continuous. That is to say that $\Delta:W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)\to W^{-1,p}(\Omega)$ is an isomorphism as desired.</p>

"2384771","2384949","<p>The 'meaning' of interval estimates is a controversial topic on
applied statistics. So there is no universally accepted answer to your
important question. </p>

<p>Let's just use a proposed sample of size $n = 31$ from a normal population with
unknown population mean $\mu$ and unknown variance $\sigma^2.$ </p>

<p>Then $T = \frac{\bar X - \mu}{S/\sqrt{n}} \sim \mathsf{T}(n-1),$ so that
$P(-2.042 \le T = \frac{\bar X - \mu}{S/\sqrt{n}} \le 2.042 )=0.95.$
Here $\bar X$ and $S$ are the sample mean and variance, respectively.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Manipulating inequalities in the event, we get
  $P(\bar X - 2.042\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}} \le \mu \le \bar X + 2.042\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}) = 0.95.$ This is purely a probability statement. Specifically, it is a
  probability statement about the behavior of the random variable $\bar X$ and $S$: the random interval $(\bar X - 2.042\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}, \bar X + 2.042\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}})$ has a 95% probability of covering (including) the unknown constant $\mu.$ </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now suppose we take the sample and obtain $\bar X = 21.3$ and $S^2 = 1.44.$ Then the random interval becomes $\left(21.3 - 2.042(0.1249), (21.3 + 2.042(0.1249)\right)$ or $(20.860, 21.740).$</p>

<p>But now we are dealing with observed quantities. According to the usual
frequentist interpretation of probability, this is no longer a probability
statement: Either the interval $(20.860, 21.740)$ includes $\mu$ or it
does not. Accordingly, the interval $(20.860, 21.740)$ is called a 95% <em>confidence</em> interval.</p>

<p>The confidence interval is a statement about the <em>data.</em> Over the long run,
we will obtain data so that
the manipulation in the emphasized paragraph will produce an interval
that includes the true population $\mu$ in 95% of such experiments. </p>

<p>The reason for calling the interval estimate a 'confidence' interval
instead of a 'probability' interval has to do with a strict interpretation
by frequentist statisticians of the word 'probability'. </p>

<p>Bayesian statisticians treat $\mu$ as a random variable, begin with a
'prior' distribution on $\mu$, combine the data with the prior distribution
to get a 'posterior' distribution, and use the posterior distribution to
get a <em>probability</em> interval for $\mu$ (some say a <em>credible</em> interval). If the prior distribution is
""flat"" (containing little information), then the Bayesian and frequentist
interval estimates will be <em>numerically</em> very similar. But philosophies as to
the ""meaning"" of the interval estimate differ.</p>

<p>Both frequentists and Bayesians have their critics. Strictly speaking,
frequentists are are not saying anything about the experiment at hand--only

"2384809","2385164","<p>The concept has many names, including harmonic quadruple, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_harmonic_conjugate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">harmonic conjugates</a>, harmonic throws, and certainly some more. It's a property about four points on a line (which in some situations may be the complex “line” $\mathbb C^1$), or more specifically two pairs of points, which can be described in various ways. A common one is the following incidence configuration, taken from Wikipedia:</p>

<p><a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pappusharmonic.svg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XLpxC.png"" alt=""Incidence construction""></a></p>

<p>The points $\{\{A,B\},\{C,D\}\}$ form a harmonic quadruple. Another way to express this is via the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-ratio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cross-ratio</a>: harmonic quadruples have cross ratio $-1$ (or $2$ or $\frac12$ depending on the order of the points).</p>

<p>Harmonic quadruples are essential building blocks in many approaches to projective geometry. On the one hand, the configuration above is pure incidence, with no metric information, and as a result any transformation which preserves collinearity will preserve harmonic quadruples. On the other hand, harmonic quadruples can be used to express all elementary arithmetic operations, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring. Not square roots. By expressing I mean that if you fix a projective basis (three points $0$, $1$ and $\infty$) on a line, you can express arithmetic on that line using constructions resulting in harmonic conjugates.</p>

<p>So how does this apply to your situation? Well, apart from incidence information you have two additional concepts, namely parallels ($LK\parallel VW$) and midpoints ($M$ is midpoint of $VW$). But these two can be translated into the language of harmonic conjugates. Parallel lines are lines meeting at infinity. And if $(A,B;C,\infty)=-1$, i.e. these four points are a harmonic quaquadruple, then $C$ is the midpoint of $AB$. You can see this if you imagine moving the point $C$ further and further to the right in the above configuration, and as you do, $MN$ will approach parallelism with $AB$, and $D$ will become the midpoint of $AB$.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JSnLq.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JSnLq.png"" alt=""Your configuration""></a></p>

<p>So to show that $M$ is the midpoint of $VW$ you need to show $(V,W;M,\infty)=-1$, where $\infty$ is the point of infinity on the line $VW$.
Unfortunately the witness construction given above can't be found in your construction straight away. We have to pick a slight detour. There are probably many different alternatives one could pick, but I'll go for this one: Label the point where $AB$ intersects $KL$ as $P$. Then $(A,B;M,P)=-1$ as implied by the witness construction, using $C,K,L,O$ as the other points.</p>

<p>Now I did mention earlier on that harmonic quadruples are preserved by projective transformations. Which implies that a central projection from one line to another will preserve it. Use $K$ as that center of projection, and project points from $AB$ to $VW$. This takes $A$ to $W$, $B$ to $V$, $M$ stays on the intersection and $L$ becomes $\infty$ since $KP\parallel VW$. This leads to $(W,V;M,\infty)=-1$ q.e.d.</p>

$$

"2384853","2385207","<p>I found it awkward to present the following argument without at least <em>some</em> reference to $\ln z$; so I essentially ""invented"" it here at equation (4), then developed a couple of basic properties such as $e^{\ln z} = z$.  But it doesn't take much ""logarithm theory"" to answer this question.</p>

<p>In $D = \Bbb C \setminus \Bbb R^- = \Bbb C \setminus (-\infty, 0]$, we may without ambiguity take</p>

<p>$z = re^{i\theta}, \tag 1$</p>

<p>since $\theta$ is restricted to the interval $(-\pi, \pi)$.  Furthermore, since the point $r = 0$ is excluded from $D$ as well, $\ln r$ is a well-defined <em>real</em> function on $D$.  We may therefore define the complex-valued function on $D$</p>

<p>$g(z) = \ln r + i\theta; \tag 2$</p>

<p>we note that</p>

<p>$e^{g(z)} = e^{\ln r + i\theta} = e^{\ln r} e^{i \theta} = re^{i\theta} = z. \tag 3$</p>

<p>Next, we observe that $z^{-1}$ is holomorphic in $D$, and we <strong><em>define</em></strong> the function $\ln z$ in $D$ <em>via</em> the formula</p>

<p>$\ln z = \displaystyle \int_1^z s^{-1} ds, \tag 4$</p>

<p>where the integral is taken over any path in $D$ which joins $1$ and $z \in D$; since $z^{-1}$ is holomorphic the integral is path-independent, and $\ln z$ is holomorphic in $D$.  We show $e^{\ln z} = z$.  Consider the holomorphic function</p>

<p>$F(z) = z^{-1} e^{\ln z}; \tag 5$</p>

<p>since</p>

<p>$\ln 1 = \displaystyle \int_1^1 s^{-1} ds = 0, \tag 6$</p>

<p>we have</p>

<p>$F(1) = 1; \tag 7$</p>

<p>also,</p>

<p>$F'(z) = -z^{-2}e^{\ln z} + z^{-1}(\ln z)' e^{\ln z} = -z^{-2}e^{\ln z} + z^{-2}e^{\ln z} = 0, \tag 8$</p>

<p>since $(\ln z)' = z^{-1}$ from (4).  I fowllows fro (8) that $F(z)$ is a constant and so by (7) we see that</p>

<p>$z^{-1}e^{\ln z} = F(z) = 1 \tag 9$</p>

<p>for all $z \in D$;  hence</p>

<p>$e^{\ln z} = z. \tag {10}$</p>

<p>We combine (2) and (10):</p>

<p>$e^{\ln z} = e^{g(z)}, \tag {11}$</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>$e^{(g(z) - \ln z)} = 1; \tag {12}$</p>

<p>if follows that</p>

<p>$g(z) = \ln z + 2n\pi i \tag{13}$</p>

<p>for some $n \in \Bbb Z$; but</p>

<p>$g(1) = 0 = \ln 1, \tag{14}$</p>

<p>so $n = 0$ and</p>

<p>$\ln r + i \theta = g(z) = \ln z \tag{15}$</p>

the harmonic conjugate of $\theta = \arg(z)$ in $D$ is $\ln r$.</p>

"2384910","2385680","<p>First of all, I would say that it is a bit strange to say that '$P(x) \land \forall x \ Q(x)$ is equivalent to $\forall x (P(x) \land \ Q(x))$ assuming the $x$ in $P(x)$ in the first formula is bound', given that that $x$ is <em>not</em> bound in that formula!  And the equivalence of formulas can always be determined on the basis of those formulas, without referring to some implicit larger context.</p>

<p>Anyway, your criticism is on the mark.  That is, if we do consider a formula where the $x$ is actually bound, we can of course bind it with an existential. As such: Is $\exists x (P(x) \land \forall x \ Q(x))$ (or the equivalent $\exists x P(x) \land \forall x \ Q(x)$ equivalent to $\forall x (P(x) \land \ Q(x))$?

<p>$P(x) \land \forall x \ Q(x)$ is equivalent to $\forall x (P(x) \land \ Q(x))$ if and only if for every any interpretation $I$ and variable-assignment $v$ that maps $x$ to some object $d$ in the domain $D$ of $I$:</p>

<p>$I,v \vDash P(x) \land \forall x \ Q(x)$ iff $I,v \vDash \forall x (P(x) \land \ Q(x))$</p>

<p>Does that biconditional hold?  No. We can take your example here. Consider interpretation $I$  with domain $\mathbb{N}$, $P(x)$: $x$ is even and $Q(x)$: $x \ge 0$, and pick variable-assignment $v$ with $v(x) = 12$</p>

<p>Then indeed we have that $I,v \vDash P(x) \land \forall x \ Q(x)$, but we don't have that $I,v \vDash \forall x (P(x) \land \ Q(x))$</p>

"2384963","2385044","<p>For a physicist the first and second part of your chosen path take, in the limit, place infinitely far away from the origin. Hence there is no force working and both integrals have a zero contribution. Only the last integral, where you move from infinitely far away in the $z$-direction toward the point $(a,b,c)$ you integrate over a non-zero force and you will find the answer you are looking for.</p>

<p>As a mathematician you would work out all of the integrals for explicitly finite values of $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ and only after having the result take the proper limits. </p>

<p>In either case the contribution of the integral in the last line will go to zero.</p>

<p>There is however an slight issue and that is concerned with the force calculation in the last line. The force has a magnitude and a direction, which is not properly included. You need to use $\vec{F} = |F| \hat{F}$ for a radial force, which gives on this particular path: 
$$
\vec{F} = \frac{A}{(x^2+y_0^2+z_0^2)} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y_0^2+z_0^2}} \left( \begin{array}{l} x \\ y_0 \\ z_0 \end{array}\right)

  <p>When a submodule $N$ of a $R$-module $M$ is a direct summand of $M$?</p>

<p>There is not really any criterion (one significantly simpler than the definition) to spot summands in general. It all depends on the module structure of $M$. There is an important equivalent condition, though: $N$ is a summand of $M$ if and only if there is an idempotent homomorphism $e:M\to M$ such that $e(M)=N$.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At this point things are easier since the idempotent homomorphisms $R\to R$ are given by idempotent elements of $R$. So a right ideal $T$ is a summand of $R_R$ iff there is an idempotent element $e\in R$ such that $eR=T$.</p>

"2384975","2385086","<p>I presume that it is clear that there can be no direction for the electric field to point in because of symmetry and that one need to be careful very careful with the singularity.</p>

<p>In your first approach, this works out because the shift of ${\bf x}$ to the origin, you impose the symmetry directly on the integral and the electric field from opposite sides cancels immediately.</p>

<p>In the second approach there is you need to be careful with the expansion you use for $\frac{1}{|{\bf x}-{\bf x'}|}$, which is valid only for $|{\bf x}| \neq |{\bf x}'|$. In the case of equality it does not converge, but you actually don't need it because you can use a spherical Gauss surface to compute the radially directed electric field.</p>

<p>If you take the integral $\int_0^\mu$ with $\mu&lt;|{\bf x}|$ you obtain $\frac{4 \pi}{3} \mu^3 \frac{1}{x}$ which is just the potential due to all charge within a sphere of radius $\mu$ and contributes $\frac{4 \pi \mu^3}{3 x^2} \hat{x}~~~$ to the electric field. </p>

<p>The outside integral $\int_\nu^R$ with $|{\bf x}|&lt;\nu$ gives a contribution $\frac{4 \pi}{3} (R^3 - \nu^3)$ to the potential, which does not depend on $x$ at all and hence does not result in any electric field. This is true for any homogenous spherical shell or more generally and radially symmetric charge distribution and I am sure it has been told/explained in one of the lectures. </p>

<p>So what is with the discrepancy between these two different outcomes? If we consider the direction you get for the electric field in the second approach, you notice that is is directed radially outwards with respect to the origin of the system. This would, however suggest that the direction of the electric field that is experienced at the point ${\bf x}$ would depend on the chosen reference frame. This is clearly unphysical and hence there can not or better there should not be such an electric field.</p>

<p>There is however a difference between the first and second approach and it is a rather subtle one. In the first case you consider the point ${\bf x}$ in the centre of a homogenous sphere of radius $R$ and take the limit $R \rightarrow \infty$. In the second case you consider a sphere of radius $R$ that is not centered around ${\bf x}$. </p>

<p>As long as you perform the calculation on an identical charge density distributions (finite values of $R$) with respect to the point ${\bf x}$, both methods will give the same answer. If you consider a spherical distribution centered at ${\bf x}$ the field will be zero in the first approach and the second approach has a correction from a the shell far away at distance $R$. The reason being that there are no complete spherical shells near the border. The electric field contribution of a small charge density element there is proportional to $\frac{1}{R^2}$, but at the same time the shell also has a volume proportional to $R^2$. This combination will give a finite contribution that will counteract the electric field from the spherical charge distribution for $|{\bf x'}| &lt; |{\bf x}|$.</p>

<p>In the alternative version where there is a homogenous spherical charge density of radius $R$ but ${\bf x}$ is not placed in the center, it is the first approach that needs to be corrected for the border region and gets an overall non-zero electric field contribution. For any finite charge density this problem never occurs, but for infinite charge densities the results can depend on how you take the limit.</p>

<p>From the physics point of view we would argue that the electric field in the infinite system is not allowed to depend on the choice of reference frame. This does, however, not imply that there is no electrostatic force in the system, but merely that it has no particular direction and therefore is isotropic. It is a pressure like force that would like to increase the distance between all charge density elements by means of a homogenous expansion.</p>

"2384988","2385024","<p>The question is asked in a possibly confusing way. In the abelian case, you have an isomorphism of complex Lie groups (i.e., both biholomorphic and a group isomorphism) with $\mathbf{C}^m\times(\mathbf{C}^*)\times T$.</p>

<p>In the nilpotent case you can then both ask about the biholomorphic type, or about a result really about complex Lie group classification.</p>

<p>The abelian case is an easy consequence of the fact that the group has to be quotient of its universal cover by a discrete normal subgroup (which has to be central, since any discrete normal subgroup in a connected group is central).</p>

<p>So in the nilpotent case we can mimic this: the connected nilpotent complex Lie groups are quotients of a simply connected complex nilpotent Lie group $G$ by a discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ of its center $Z_G$ (which is isomorphic to $\mathbf{C}^k$ for some $k$). </p>

<p>In the abelian case, one considers the real hull $V$ of $\Gamma$. Then $V\cap iV$ ""corresponds"" to the $T$ part, and $V+iV$ corresponds to the $\mathbf{C}^n\oplus T$ part. Here we can define these subspaces, but in general we cannot deduce a decomposition of the whole group. So I don't see a better way to state the structural fact than describing as a quotient as above. (See two examples below.)</p>

<p>To get the biholomorphic type (forgetting the group structure) is, however, doable. Indeed, the exponential conjugates the group law of $G$ to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff law of its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. In particular, we have $\exp(z)\exp(x)=\exp(z+x)$ when $z$ is central. So the left action of $Z_G$ in itself it conjugate to the left action of its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{z}$ by addition. Thus $G/\Gamma$ is biholomorphic to $\mathfrak{g}/\Gamma$, which is part of the abelian case since one now considers addition; this answers positively your last question. </p>

<hr>

<p>First example: $G$ is the 3-dimensional complex Heisenberg group. Then $Z_G$ is 1-dimensional. One can either mod out (a) by $\{0\}$, (b) by a cyclic subgroup of $Z_G$, or (c) by a lattice in $Z_G$. In all the cases, $G/\Gamma$ does not split as a non-trivial direct product (as a complex Lie group). [Actually, the Lie algebra, as a 6-dimensional real Lie algebra, does not split as a direct product, so in none of the cases there is a decomposition even as a 6-dimensional real Lie group] (a) is a single case; (b) is also a single case up to isomorphism, since the automorphism group of the Heisenberg group acts transitively on the center minus 0. (c) Yields may cases, namely the lattice is well-defined modulo similarity, still leaving a continuum of non-isomorphic complex Lie groups (they can be checked to also not be non-isomorphic as real Lie groups, maybe up to pairs).</p>

<p>Second example: start from the direct product $H$ of the latter with $\mathbf{C}$. So the center $Z$ is now isomorphic to $\mathbf{C}^2$, and has a ""distinguished"" 1-dimensional subspace $D$, namely the intersection with the derived subgroup.</p>

<p>Then $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to $\mathbf{Z}^k$ for some $k\in\{0,1,2,3,4\}$. When $\Gamma$ splits as product of $\Gamma\cap D$ with another subgroup, this yields a product of one of the preceding case with an abelian complex Lie group. I think it happens precisely when the real hull $V$ of $\Gamma$ is such that $\Gamma\cap D$ is a lattice in $V\cap D$. But for $k\ge 2$ there are many other cases, for instance, when $\Gamma$ is a lattice ($k=4$) but has zero (or cyclic) intersection with $V$. Or when $V$ is a real plane ($k=2$) intersecting $D$ in a real line, and $\Gamma$ does not meet $D$.</p>

"2385019","2385080","<p>I'm afraid there's quite a bit of confusion going on here. So let me try to address not only your two actual questions, but also some other issues that I see here.</p>

<p><strong>[1]</strong> Generally  speaking, parentheses in logical expressions are used in the same way and for the same purpose as in arithmetical expressions: to show order of operations, or so to speak to show which things go together and which don't. So the answer to the question in your title:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What's the difference between $\forall x(P(x))$ and $\forall xP(x)$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is that there's no difference, as they mean exactly the same thing: for all values of $x$ (in the given domain or universe) $P(x)$ is true. (Note that this also covers both your Questions 1 and 2.) But...</p>

<p><strong>[2]</strong> Taking things out of context is extremely dangerous!!! If someone asks you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What's the difference between $2+3$ and $(2+3)$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>anybody will say that they are the same thing, both equal to $5$... Until it turns out that they were taken from longer expressions $\color{green}{2+3\cdot4}$ and $\color{blue}{(2+3)\cdot4}$, where presence or absence of parentheses makes a whole lot of difference!</p>

<p><strong>[3]</strong> And that's why the actual question in the body of your post hardly has anything to do with what you asked in the title. According to your post, you're</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>trying to prove is that $\forall x\, \exists y\, (P(x)\to Q(y))$ is logically equivalent to $(\forall x\, P(x))\to(\exists y\,Q(y))$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that while $\forall xP(x)$ is the antecedent of the second formula, $\forall x(P(x))$ does not appear anywhere in either of them. So when you used it in the title, where did it come from?</p>

<p><strong>[4]</strong> Moreover, these two statements actually are <strong>NOT</strong> equivalent to each other. Here's a quick counterexample. Let the domain be all integers $\mathbb{Z}$. Let</p>

<p>$$P(x)=[x\text{ is even}] \quad \text{and} \quad Q(y)=[y+1&lt;y].$$</p>

<p>(I'm using brackets as quotation marks.) Then:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>$\forall x\, \exists y\, (P(x)\to Q(y))$ is <em>false</em>. It requires that for any $x$ there exists some $y$ such that $P(x)\to Q(y)$. But if $x=2$, then $P(2)\to Q(y)$ doesn't hold for any $y$, because $P(2)$ is true and $Q(y)$ is false for any $y$.</p></li>
<li><p>But $(\forall x\, P(x))\to(\exists y\,Q(y))$ is <em>true</em>, because the antecedent $\forall x\, P(x)$ is false.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So if you have been given an exercise where two statements are given and your task is to prove that they are logically equivalent, then maybe you made a typo somewhere?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For each $a = (a_j)_{j\in\mathbb{N}} \in \{1, 2\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ we define $x(a) := 2 \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_j}{4^j}$. Then $x(a) \in I_n$ for all $n \geq 0$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, this is because $I_n$ contains all real numbers $x \in [0, 2]$ such that the $(n+1)$-th digit in the $4$-ary expansion of $\frac{x}{2}$ is either $1$ or $2$.</p>

<p>In particular, for each $a \in \{1, 2\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ we have</p>

<p>$$ g(x(a))
= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{4^n} k(4^n x(a))
= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{4^n}
= \frac{4}{3} $$</p>

<p>Since $g(x) \leq \frac{4}{3}$ is always true, it follows that $M = \frac{4}{3}$. Moreover, $x(a) \in D$ for any $a \in \{1, 2\}^{\mathbb{N}}$. So $x : \{1, 2\}^{\mathbb{N}} \to [0, 2]$ is an injective map whose image lies in $D$ and hence $D$ is uncountable.</p>

"2385107","2388198","<p>It seems like there might be some typos in your question. Firstly, $S_t$ is not a standard Brownian motion since it has a non-zero ""drift term"" and non-unity ""diffusion coefficient"". Secondly, the equation:
$$ dS_t = \mu \,dt + \sigma\,dW_t $$
has solution $$ S_t=\mu t+\sigma W_t +S_0 $$
On the other hand, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">geometric Brownian motion</a> (GBM) satisfies:
$$ dX_t = X_t( \mu \,dt + \sigma\,dW_t ) $$
and has solution (as you found) $$ X_t=X_0\exp\left( \left[\mu-\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right]t+\sigma W_t \right) $$
In any case, let's apply <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1465324/it%C3%B4s-formula-differential-form"">Ito's lemma</a> to GBM: $$ df(t,X_t)=\partial_t f(t,X_t)\,dt+\partial_xf(t,X_t)\,dX_t+\frac{1}{2}\partial_{xx}f(t,X_t)[dX_t]^2 $$
So we set $U_t= 1/X_t$ (i.e. $U_t=f(X_t)$, where $f(X_t)=X_t^{-1}$. Thus, by Ito's Lemma:
\begin{align}
dU_t &amp;= -X_t^{-2}\,dX_t+\frac{1}{2}(2X_t^{-3})\sigma^2X_t^2\,dt\\

"2385120","2386002","<p>As you’ve observed, the projected line segment is not symmetric about the view line to the circle’s center—the center shifts. Another reason that you might be having some trouble working this out is that the apparent width of the ellipse also depends on the visual angle subtended by the circle, which varies with both the distance of the viewpoint from the center of the circle and the circle’s radius.  </p>

<p>(Diagram provided by the OP.)</p>

<p>This problem can be reduced to finding the intersection of pairs of lines, which is easily done using homogeneous coordinates. We place the circle on the $x$-$y$ plane, centered at the origin, and Let the viewpoint be $V=(0,d\cos\theta,d\sin\theta)$, ($d&gt;0$). We’ll first look at what’s going on in the $y$-$z$ plane. In the above diagram, the horizontal direction represents $z$ and the vertical $y$. To reduce clutter, the $x$-coordinate will be suppressed and, at the risk of introducing some confusion, the others will be designated $x'$ and $y'$, respectively.  </p>

<p>The line perpendicular to $\overline{OV}$ that passes through the upper point $A(0,r)$ is $y'=r-x'\cot\theta$, which we can rewrite in normal form as $x'\cos\theta+y'\sin\theta-r\sin\theta=0$. The homogeneous vector that represents this line consists of the coefficients of the latter equation: $$\mathbf l=(\cos\theta,\sin\theta,-r\sin\theta).$$ The line through $V$ and the lower point $B(0,-r)$ is represented by the cross product of the homogeneous coordinates of these points: $$\mathbf m=(d\cos\theta,d\sin\theta,1)\times(0,-r,1)=(r+d\sin\theta,-d\cos\theta,-dr\cos\theta).$$ Their intersection is $$\mathbf l\times\mathbf m=(-dr\sin2\theta,dr\cos2\theta-r^2\sin\theta,-(d+r\sin\theta))$$ which in Cartesian coordinates is $$C=\left({dr\sin2\theta\over d+r\sin\theta},{r^2\sin\theta-dr\cos2\theta\over d+r\sin\theta}\right).$$ The minor axis length of the circle’s image is $AC$, which you can compute using the standard formula for the distance between two points as $${2dr\cos\theta\over d+r\sin\theta}.$$ Compared to your initial guess, there’s an extra factor of ${d\over d+r\sin\theta}$ that accounts for the asymmetry of the view and the “angular size correction” factor. As $d\to\infty$, so that the projection becomes closer and closer to parallel, this correction factor approaches unity.</p>

<hr>

<p>This isn’t the whole story, though. Rays from the viewpoint through points on the circle converge as they get closer to the viewpoint, so the other semi-axis of the circle’s projection isn’t going to be equal to $r$, either. To work out what this is, first project the center of the ellipse back to the $x$-$y$ plane. This center is the midpoint of $A$ and $C$ and its pre-image can be found by intersecting lines again: $$\begin{align}D &amp;= \frac12\left((0,r)+\left({dr\sin2\theta\over d+r\sin\theta},{r^2\sin\theta-dr\cos2\theta\over d+r\sin\theta}\right)\right) \\ &amp;=\left(\frac{d r \sin (\theta ) \cos (\theta )}{d+r \sin (\theta )},\frac{r \sin (\theta ) (d \sin (\theta )+r)}{d+r \sin (\theta )}\right)\end{align}$$ and its back-projection is $$\overline{VD}\times\overline{OA}=(V\times D)\times(-1,0,0)=\left(0,\frac{d r^2 \sin (\theta ) \cos (\theta )}{d+r \sin (\theta )},\frac{d^2 \cos (\theta )}{d+r \sin (\theta )}\right)$$ which becomes $\left(0,\frac{r^2}d\sin\theta\right)$ in Cartesian coordinates.  </p>

<p>Going back to 3-D coordinates, this is the point $\left(0,\frac{r^2}d\sin\theta,0\right)$. The $x$-coordinates of the points on the circle with this $y$-coordinate are $\pm\sqrt{r^2-y^2}=\pm r\sqrt{1-\left(\frac rd\sin\theta\right)^2}$. I’ll leave finding the projections of these points and the resulting semi-axis length to you (hint: you can use similar triangles).</p>

"2385159","2385230","<p>I will only answer question 1 and only from the model theorist's perspective: $C(X)$ is not elementary equivalent to $C(Y)$ (i.e. we can find a sentence in the language of rings with is true in one but false in the other). This implies that they are also not isomorphic (your remark above demonstrates that they are not ""canonically"" isomorphic). </p>

<p>Let $\rho(x) =(\exists y)(x\cdot y=1)$; $\varphi(x)=(\exists y)(y^{2}=x)$; 
 and $\psi(x)= \varphi(x) \wedge (\forall y \neq \mathbf{0})(\varphi(y)\to\neg\varphi(x-y))$. $\rho(x)$ is the collection of elements which have an inverse, $\varphi(x)$ is the collection of elements which are squares, and $\psi(x)$ is the collection of elements which are both squares and for any other (non-zero) square, their difference is not a square (we think of $\psi(x)$ as elements which are positive and close to $0$. For instance, the identity function from $X \to X$ satisfies this condition). </p>

<p>Claim 1: Let $f \in C(X)$ or $f \in C(Y)$. Then, $f$ is a square iff $f \geq 0$. </p>

<p>Claim 2: If $f \in C(X)$ and $\psi(f)$ is true, then $\exists x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = 0$. This follows from the fact that $X$ is compact. However, this is not true for $g \in C(Y)$. Consider $g = id_Y$. </p>

<p>Claim 3: If $f \in C(X)$ and $\psi(f)$ is true, then $f$ does not have a multiplicative inverse in $C(X)$ (since $f(x_0) = 0$ for some $x_0$). However, this is not true in $C(Y)$ as remarked above. </p>

<p>Claim 4: $C(X)\models\forall x(\psi(x)\to\neg\rho(x))$ and $C(Y) \models \exists x(\psi(x) \wedge \rho(x))$. </p>

<p>Therefore, the two structures are not elementary equivalent in the language of rings. </p>

<hr>

<p>Furthermore, we can define a partial order on these structures (in the ring language) by saying that $f \leq g \iff \varphi(g -f)$. Now, $C(X)$ is archimedean with respect to this partial order (and the unique image of $\mathbb{Z}$ mapped into this structure) while $C(Y)$ is not. </p>

"2385167","2385359","<p>A function has an asymptote of the form $y =  mx + b$ if 
$$\lim_{x \to \infty} |f(x) - (mx + b)| = 0$$
or 
$$\lim_{x \to -\infty} |f(x) - (mx + b)| = 0$$
If $m = 0$, the asymptote is horizontal.  Otherwise, it is oblique.</p>

<p>However, the domain of $f(x) = \log (4 - x^2)$ is $(-2, 2)$ since we require that the argument of the logarithm be positive, which implies 
\begin{align*}
4 - x^2 &amp; &gt; 0\\
4 &amp; &gt; x^2\\
2 &amp; &gt; |x|
\end{align*}
Thus, $|x|$ cannot approach infinity, so the function has neither a horizontal nor an oblique asymptote.</p>

<p>Observe that 
$$\lim_{x \to 2^-} (4 - x^2) = 0$$
and that 
$$\lim_{x \to -2^+} (4 - x^2) = 0$$
Therefore,
$$\lim_{x \to 2^-} \log(4 - x^2) = -\infty$$
and 
$$\lim_{x \to -2^+} \log(4 - x^2) = -\infty$$
Thus, $f(x) = \log(4 - x^2)$ has vertical asymptotes at $x = 2$ and $x = -2$.</p>

<p>A graph of $f$ is shown below for base $e$.  If you meant base $10$, multiply each $y$-coordinate of the graph by

"2385172","2385179","<p>$\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}=\mathbb{Z}_p$ for any integer $p$. Suppose $p$ is prime. Now to prove that $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a field it suffices to prove that $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is an integral domain, because any finite integral domain is a field. So to obtain a contradiction let's suppose $a$ is a zero divisor in $Z_p$. Then $a\neq0$, i.e. $p\nmid a$, and choose $b\in \mathbb{Z}_p$ with $b\neq 0$, i.e. $p\nmid b$, such that $ab=0$ or rather $p\mid ab$.

<hr>

<p>In your case we need to prove that $1,2$ have inverses in $\mathbb{Z}_3$. So observe that $$1._3 1=1$$ and $$2._3 2=1.$$ So every nonzero member of $\mathbb{Z_3} $ has an inverse. </p>

<p>The standard deviation is a measure of how closely you follow your schedule in the following sense:
the closer your values $v$ are to the mean $\mu$, the smaller the standard deviation $\sigma$.
For instance, if you had run $1$ $\text{km}$ every day, then $\sigma=0$.</p>

<p>The thing is, the standard deviation in principle does not really care that your schedule is $1$ $\text{km}$ per day...
If you had run $0$ $\text{km}$ every day, or $3$ $\text{km}$ day, then you'd also have $\sigma = 0$.</p>

<p>With this in mind, what you <em>can</em> do is take a page from least squares and calculate how far from your scheduled $1$ $\text{km}$ your jogs are, on average.
In symbols, we'll be looking at</p>

<p>$$\epsilon=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\,{\left(x_i-1\right)}^2}.$$</p>

<p>Grouping the $x_i$ by their values $v$, it turns out that</p>

<p>$$\epsilon=\sqrt{\sum_v^{}\,p_v\cdot {(v-1)}^2}.$$</p>

<p>Looks familiar, huh?
It's like the calculation for $\sigma$, except here we're forcing $\mu=1$ (our scheduled value).
Using the numbers for our previous example, we'd get</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\epsilon
&amp;=\sqrt{
\frac{9}{61}\cdot{\left(0-1\right)}^2+
\frac{38}{61}\cdot{\left(1-1\right)}^2+
\frac{9}{61}\cdot{\left(2-1\right)}^2+
\frac{5}{61}\cdot{\left(3-1\right)}^2}\\
&amp;=\sqrt{
\frac{9\cdot 1}{61}+
\frac{38\cdot 0}{61}+
\frac{9\cdot 1}{61}+
\frac{5\cdot 4}{61}}\\
&amp;=\sqrt{
\frac{38}{61}} \simeq 0.789
\end{align}</p>

<p>Now, $\epsilon$ measures how closely you follow your schedule in the following sense:
the closer your values $v$ are to your intended schedule value $($ $1$ in this case$)$, the smaller the standard deviation $\sigma$.
If you had run $1$ $\text{km}$ every day, you'd still get $\epsilon=0$.</p>

<p>Moreover, we don't run into the same problems as we did with $\sigma$ before.
If you had run $n$ $\text{km}$ every day, then you'd have $\epsilon=|n-1|$ -- you can't get better than this for these cases!</p>

<p>First, it depends on $x$. </p>

<p>If $x$ is $\pm 1$, then every orbit is a point. </p>

<p>No matter what $x$ is, every pure-real quaternion is an orbit. </p>

<p>If $x$ is a pure vector quaternion, then you might as well pick $x = \mathbf i$ (via a change of coordinates if necessary), at which point you can explicitly compute to see that for any quaternion $q = r + u$, where $r$ is real and $u$ is pure-vector, the $r$ part is invariant, so you need only look at what happens to $u$. For $u = \mathbf i$, you have a fixed point; for $u = \mathbf j, \mathbf k$, you get an orbit: $\{\mathbf j, -\mathbf j\}$ or $\{\mathbf k, -\mathbf k\}$. And in general, for $a\mathbf j + b\mathbf k$, you get a similar two-point orbit. </p>

<p>That all happens because multiplication by $i$ represents a 90-degree rotation on the sphere of unit pure-vector quaternions. For a mixed quaternion like $\cos t + \mathbf i \sin t $, you might get much more complicated orbits, I expect, but I haven't worked out the details. I suspect that Rodrigues' formula might prove useful. </p>

<p>We denote by $ f^{-n}([0,1]) $
the $n$-th iterated pre-image of $[0,1]$.
the solution set can be alternatively described as
$$
 \tag{1}
  K= \bigcap_{n\in\mathbb N} f^{-n}([0,1])
$$
It is also obvious, that $f^{-(n+1)}([0,1])\subset f^{-n}([0,1])$.</p>

<p>Now we need to get an idea what $K$ looks like.
Consider $f^{-1}([0,1])$.
It is easy to prove that
$$
 f^{-1}([0,1])= [0,\frac13]\cup[\frac23,1].
$$
As a next step, one can calculate
$$
 f^{-2}([0,1])=f^{-1}(f^{-1}([0,1]))= [0,\frac19]\cup[\frac29,\frac13]\cup[\frac23,\frac79]\cup[\frac89,1].
$$</p>

<p>One can see, that we always delete the (open) center third of an interval, when we procede
from $f^{-n}([0,1])$ to $f^{-(n+1)}([0,1])$.
This is the same process as in Cantor set (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set</a>).</p>

<p>It follows that $K$ is Cantor set.</p>

and observe how the digits change when applying $f$.</p>

"2385464","2385481","<p>As pointed out in the comments, there is an error in (2); you should have something like
$$0 = ((a+c)+(b+d))^2 = (a+c)^2+(b+d)^2 + 2(a+c)(b+d)$$
giving
$$(a+c)^2+(b+d)^2 = -2ab-2ad-2cb-2cd$$

<p>So substituting (2) into (1) gives
$$a^2_{n+1} + b^2_{n+1} + c^2_{n+1} + d^2_{n+1} = 2 (a^2_{n} + b^2_{n} + c^2_{n} + d^2_{n}) + (a_n+c_n)^2+(b_n+d_n)^2$$</p>

"2385534","2385644","<p>Because your statement of the Tarski-Vaught test is wrong. Here's what it really says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $M$ be a substructure of $N$. Then $M\preceq N$ if and only if for every first-order formula $\psi(x,\overline{b})$ with parameters $\overline{b}$ from $M$, if $N\models \exists x\,\psi(x,\overline{b})$, then there exists $a\in M$ such that $N\models \psi(a,\overline{b})$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This differs from your statement in two important ways. First, the formula $\exists x\,\psi(x,\overline{b})$ can be <em>any</em> formula that starts with an existential quantifier. It is <em>not</em> required to be an existential ($\Sigma_1$) formula, i.e. $\psi$ is not required to be quantifier-free. Second, the truth of $\psi(a,\overline{b})$ is checked in $N$, not in $M$. In some sense, this is the whole point of the Tarski-Vaught test: the definition of $M\preceq N$ requires you to compare truth in $M$ to truth in $N$, while the Tarski-Vaught test is a criterion for $M\preceq N$ that only mentions truth in $N$, never in $M$.</p>

<p>So the statement ""the Tarski-Vaught test holds"" is really quite different than the statement ""$M\preceq_{\Sigma_1} N$"". If you try to prove by induction that $M\preceq_{\Sigma_1} N$ implies $M\preceq_{\Sigma_n} N$ for all $n$, you'll run into trouble right away! (Because it's not true.)</p>

"2385546","2385649","<p>You're right! When you solve the linear diophantine equation $ax+by=c$, this equation has infinite solutions if and only if $gcd(a,b)|c$.</p>

<p>To find all of these solutions, compute $gcd(a,b)$ using the Euclidean algorithm (you only need to find one solution $(x_0,y_0))$. Once you have $(x_0,y_0)$, the other solutions comes in the form:</p>

<p>$$x=x_0+\frac {bk}{gcd(a,b)}$$
$$y=y_0-\frac {ak}{gcd(a,b)}$$</p>

<p>For all integers $k$</p>

<p>Answering your question, it depends on the values of $a$ and $b$, given that for some natural numbers $a,b$ the $gcd(a,b)$ could or could not divide $c$. For instance: $ax+by=12$</p>

<p>If $a=3$ and $b=9$, the equation $3x+9y=12$ has solutions:
$$x=1+3k$$
$$y=1-k$$
For all integers $k$</p>

<p>But, if $a=5$ and $b=10$, then $gcd(a,b)=gcd(5,10)=5$ which doesn't divide $c$. Therefore, the equation has no solutions</p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>

<hr>

<p>To find all natural solutions restrict values of k for which $x&gt;0$ and $y&gt;0$:</p>

<p>$$x&gt;0 \Rightarrow k&gt;\frac {-x_ogcd(a,b)}{b}$$
$$y&gt;0 \Rightarrow k&lt;\frac {y_ogcd(a,b)}{a}$$</p>

<p>In conclusion: </p>

<p>If $gcd(a,b)$ doesn't divide c, there are no natural solutions</p>

<p>If $gcd(a,b)$ divides c, exists a pair of natural solutions $(x_0,y_0)$ and the equation has a finite set of solutions of the form:</p>

<p>$$x=x_0+\frac {bk}{gcd(a,b)}$$
$$y=y_0-\frac {ak}{gcd(a,b)}$$</p>

<p>For all integers $k$ such that $k\in (\frac {-x_ogcd(a,b)}{b},\frac {y_ogcd(a,b)}{a})$</p>

<p>In other words, the number of natural solutions of the diophantine equation $ax+by=c$ where $c$ is given, is equal to the number of integers in the interval $(\frac {-x_ogcd(a,b)}{b},\frac {y_ogcd(a,b)}{a})$</p>

<p>Since the function is symmetric around $x=0$, it is sufficient to investigate integrability for $x\in(0,1)$ (the 1 being an arbitrary upper bound). Hence, we can drop the modulus in the exponent. Now we can show by induction and the chain rule that 
$$\frac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-x^k} = e^{-x^k}\sum_{i=I(n,k)}^n a_i x^{k-i},$$
for appropriate coefficients $a_i$, and a possibly negative $I(n,k)$. The factor $ e^{-x^k}$ in front of the sum does not affect the integrability at $x= 0$, since $ e^{-0^k} = 1$ for all $k\in\mathbb N$.</p>

<p>The critical situation arises once the sum contains negative exponents: $x^{k-i}$ is integrable if and only if $k-i &gt; -1$.

"
"2385608","2385642","<p>To answer your questions:</p>

<p>a) This is a fact about the complex numbers which is worth remembering: for any $n = 1,2,3,\dots$ the roots of the equation $x^n = 1$ are
$$
x = \exp(2 \pi ki/n), \quad k = 0,1,2,\dots,n-1
$$
(note: $\exp(i \theta) = e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i \sin \theta$).
These roots are called the ""$n$th roots of unity"".  All $n$ of these roots are distinct.</p>

<p>b) Note that $T:M_n(\Bbb C) \to M_n(\Bbb C)$ is <strong>not</strong> the transformation that one would normally associate with the matrix $A$. The transformation that you're thinking of is $L_A: \Bbb C^n \to \Bbb C^n$ given by $x \mapsto Ax$.  Yes, both transformations involve multiplication by $A$, but the spaces involved are different.  $T$ is a map between two vector spaces of dimension $n^2$ whereas $L_A$ is a transformation between spaces of dimension $n$.</p>

<p>c) There is no reason to suppose that $A$ was $18 \times 18$.  In fact, we could make a $6 \times 6$ matrix with the required properties, for example, by using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_matrix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">companion matrix</a> associated with the given polynomial.</p>

<p>In fact, if we simply take $A = \omega I$ where $\omega$ is any solution to $\omega^6 - \omega^3 + 1 = 0$, then we have a satisfactory matrix which could work for any $n$.</p>

<hr>

<p>To your comment below:</p>

<p>To see 2) in detail, what we've really said is that if $g$ is any polynomial such that $g(A) = 0$, then we have $g(T) = 0$.  This is true because for any $B$, 
$$
[g(T)](B) = g(A)B = 0B = 0
$$
<em>(However, since the polynomials satisfying $g(A) = 0$ are just the multiples of $f$, it was enough to consider $f(T))$</em></p>

<p>In 3), we show that if $g$ is any polynomial such that $g(T) = 0$, then we have $g(A) = 0$.  In particular: if $g(T) = 0$, then we can say that for <em>every</em> $B$, we have
$$
[g(T)](B) = g(A)B = 0
$$
Now, it's up to you to show that because $g(A)B = 0$ for every $B \in M_n$, it must be the case that $g(A) = 0$.</p>

"
"2385621","2385714","<p>Here are <em>two</em> (slightly more general) approaches.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you are familiar with the complex representation of $\cos(x)$, namely</p>

<p>$$\cos(x)=\frac{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}2,$$</p>

<p>then it becomes pretty straight forward. Then you have</p>

<p>$$\cos^n(x)=\frac1{2^n}\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}e^{ixk}e^{-ix(n-k)}=\frac1{2^n}\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}e^{ix(2k-n)}.$$</p>

<p>Now the $N$-th derivative is</p>

<p>$$(\cos^n(x))^{(N)}=\frac{i^N}{2^n}\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}(2k-n)^Ne^{ix(2k-n)}.$$</p>

<p>But to reformulate this in a nice real-valued form might be hard. So here another approach. We generalize the problem to find the $N$-th derivative of</p>

<p>$$f(x)=\sum_{m,n}a_{mn}\cos^m(x)\sin^n(x)$$</p>

<p>with $m$ and $n$ ranging over $\Bbb Z$ and the $a_{mn}$ choosen appropriately, so the sum stays finite. At first, note</p>

<p>$$f'(x)=\sum_{m,n}a_{mn}(m\cos^{m-1}(x)(-\sin^{n+1}(x))+n\sin^{n-1}(x)\cos^{m+1}(x))$$</p>

<p>by only applying chain and product rule. We see further that this is the same as</p>

<p>\begin{align}
f'(x)&amp;=-\sum_{m,n}ma_{mn}\sin^{n+1}(x)\cos^{m-1}(x)+\sum_{m,n}na_{mn}\cos^{m+1}(x)\sin^{n-1}(x)\\
&amp;=-\sum_{m,n}(m+1)a_{m+1,n-1}\sin^n(x)\cos^m(x)+\sum_{m,n}(n+1)a_{m-1,n+1}\cos^m(x)\sin^n(x)\\
&amp;=\sum_{m,n}a^{(1)}_{mn}\cos^m(x)\sin^n(x)
\end{align}</p>

<p>with $a^{(1)}_{mn}=(n+1)a_{m-1,n+1}-(m+1)a_{m+1,n-1}$. Now you can iteratively compute $a^{(N)}_{mn}$ for $N\geq 2$ to get your final answer. For your task you want to start with $a_{mn}=a^{(0)}_{mn}=1$ for $(m,n)=(9,0)$ and zero everywhere else. Maybe one can see a nice pattern emerging when computing the coefficients. I will have to look at it later.</p>
"
"2385640","2385645","<p>You are counting certain instances multiple times. Say you select $A_1$, then $B_1$, and then $A_2$. This exact same selection happens if you select $A_2$, then $B_1$, and then $A_1$. (See edit below for more details).</p>

<p>Another approach would be to count how many combinations there are without having at least one $A$ and one $B$, and then subtracting from the total. There are $\binom{4}{3}$ ways to not have any $A$'s, $\binom{3}{3}$ ways to not have any $B$'s, and it's impossible to not have any of either, so we get
$$
\frac{\binom{6}{3}-\binom{4}{3}-\binom{3}{3}}{\binom{6}{3}} = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}. 
$$</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT:
In your count, you choose one $A$, then one $B$, and then one card remaining. Enumerating, we obtain:</p>

<p>$A_1B_1A_2$</p>

<p>$A_1B_1B_2$</p>

<p>$A_1B_1B_3$</p>

<p>$A_1B_1C$</p>

<p>$A_1B_2A_2$</p>

<p>$A_1B_2B_1$</p>

<p>$A_1B_2B_3$</p>

<p>$A_1B_2C$</p>

<p>...and so forth. However we have included $A_1B_1B_2=A_1B_2B_1$ twice. Continuing in this way, we will double count all counts of the form $A_iB_jA_k$ and all counts of the form $A_iB_jB_k$. There are $\binom{2}{1}\binom{3}{1}\binom{1}{1}=6$ of the first type and $\binom{2}{1}\binom{3}{1}\binom{2}{1}=12$ second type. Thus we have $6/2+12/2=9$ extra counts. This is consistent because $24-9=15$.</p>

"2385654","2386033","<p>Eric Wofsey's answer shows that regulatiry for sets implies regularity for classes, provided you have enough other axioms (like replacement) available. In the particular case you asked about, where the class $A$ consists of transitive sets, you can avoid part of Eric's argument, namely the part where he produces a transitive set $T$.  </p>

<p>In detail: Given a nonempty class $A$ of transitive sets, begin by considering some $y\in A$. If you're very lucky, $y\cap A=\varnothing$ and you're done. So suppose from now on that $y\cap A$ is a nonempty set.  (It's a set, not a proper class, because $y$ is a set.)  By regularity for sets, $y\cap A$ has an element $z$ with $z\cap y\cap A=\varnothing$.  So we have $z\in A$, and if we can show $z\cap A=\varnothing$ then we'll be done.</p>

<p>Now we use that all elements of $A$ are transitive. In particular $y$ is transitive, so, from $z\in y$, we get $z\subseteq y$ and thus $z\cap y=z$. But then what we already knew, that $z\cap y\cap A=\varnothing$, simplifies to $z\cap A=\varnothing$, and the proof is complete.</p>
"
"2385666","2385697","<p>There are two objects being considered here - the <em>sample space</em> $\Omega$, and an unnamed <em>state space</em> which I shall call $E$, which in this case is assumed to be a Banach space. (It is fairly unhelpful that the author does not give the state space a name, and probably contributes to your confusion.) Our random variable is $X:\Omega\to E$.</p>

<p>Random variables need not take values in Banach spaces. Indeed, at its most basic definition, a random variable is just a measurable map from a probability space to a measurable space. However, for almost all practical purposes, we require some topology on the state space. Do you want any kind of notion of convergence? Then you need some kind of topology.</p>

<p>(Edit, to make something clear from the comments: whenever you have a topological space, you also have a measurable space by considering the Borel $\sigma$-field. Unless otherwise specified, you should always assume this is the $\sigma$-field considered when we have a topological space being considered in measure/probability theory.)</p>

<p>In this case, we are looking at the expectation of a random variable, which we know is simply the integral of the measurable function $X$. But what is the integral? Any definition of an integral requires linear combinations and limits, so at the least we will require $E$ to be a topological vector space. Assuming $E$ is Banach simply makes things a little cleaner - the topology of a normed vector space is easier to understand, and making it complete (i.e. Banach) merely guarantees that the space possesses enough limits to avoid running into problems.</p>

"2385673","2386093","<p>As phrased, it seems to be talking about the precursor terms to the Morse-Thue sequence:</p>

"2385685","2389882","<p>I will reduce the question to some known results. For positive numbers $a,b$ we define the geometric mean $G(a,b)$ and the power mean of order $s$ denoted by $M_s(a,b)$ as folows
$$G(a,b)=\sqrt{ab},\qquad M_s(a,b)=\left(\frac{a^s+b^s}{2}\right)^{1/s}$$
Now, with $a=x$, $b=1/x$, and writing $M_s$ and $G$ instead of $M_s(a,b)$ and $G(a,b)$ for simplicity, the proposed inequality takes the form
$$\frac{M_1^p-G^p}{M_p^p-G^p}\ge 2^{1-p}$$
So, this is a particular case of the more general inequality</p>

<p>$$\frac{M_s^p-G^p}{M_t^p-G^p}\ge 2^{p/t-p/s}$$

"2385693","2385734","<p>Let's say $\pi \colon P \rightarrow M$ is a fiber bundle. The fiber $\pi^{-1}(q)$ through $q \in M$ is a submanifold of $P$ (diffeomorphic to $G$ in your case, but this is not really relevant for what follows). Choose a point in the fiber $p \in \pi^{-1}(q)$. A tangent vector at $p \in P$ which is tangent to the fiber is just a tangent vector which belongs to the tangent space of the fiber $\pi^{-1}(q)$ (identified as a subspace of the tangent space to the total space $T_pP$). Such a tangent vector is represented by an equivalence class $[\alpha]$ of smooth curves $\alpha \colon I \rightarrow \pi^{-1}(q)$ with $\alpha(0) = p$ (that is, curves in $P$ that pass through $p$ and stay on the fiber). Since $\pi(\alpha(t)) \equiv q$ is a constant curve on $M$, by differentiating we get that</p>

<p>$$ d\pi|_{p}(\dot{\alpha}(0)) = 0 $$</p>

<p>so the tangent vector $\dot{\alpha}(0)$ lies in $\ker(d\pi|_p)$. By using the local model of a fiber bundle, you can see that the converse also holds so the tangent space to the fiber $\pi^{-1}(q)$ at $p$ is just the kernel $\ker(d\pi|_p)$.</p>

"2385808","2386087","<p>There is a bit more general statement which can be useful when checking if an operation defines a group or not.</p>

<p>Your statement is that $e$ is identity with respect to $*$, but this can be relaxed to only require that $e$ is left identity. More precisely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $(G,*)$ be a semigroup, i.e. $*$ is associative binary operation
  on $G$. If the following holds:</p>
  
  <p>$(1)$ $\ (\forall a\in G)\ e*a = a,$</p>
  
  <p>$(2)$ $\ (\forall a\in G)(\exists b\in G)\ b*a = e,$</p>
  
  <p>then $(G,*)$ is a group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof.</em> We first prove that every element in $a$ is invertible in $G$. Let $a\in G$ and let $b,c\in G$ such that $b*a = e$ and $c*b = e$ (those exist by $(2)$). Then,</p>

<p>$$a*b \stackrel{(1)}= e*(a*b) = (c*b)*(a*b) = c*((b*a)*b) =c*(e*b) = c*b = e,$$ so we see that left inverse guaranteed by $(2)$ is in fact two-sided inverse.$^{[1]}$</p>

<p>Now, we want to prove that $e$ is two-sided identity. Let $a\in G$. Then we have $$a*e = a*(a^{-1}*a) = (a*a^{-1})* a = e * a = a$$ and we are done.</p>

<p>Doesn't seem much of an improvement, but when you have non-commutative operation, it can be tedious to <em>calculate</em> first both left and right identity and then both left and right inverse. This here says if you have calculated both left identity and left inverse for all elements, then you don't have to worry about the other side.</p>

<hr>

<p>$[1]$ Here it is essential that <em>every</em> element of $G$ has left inverse. It is very common in mathematics to encounter monoids in which some elements have left inverse, some right, some both, and some neither. For example, consider set of functions on some infinite set $X$. Then injective functions are those that have left inverse, surjective have right inverse and bijective have two-sided inverse. Since $X$ is infinite, there are injective functions that are not bijective (for example, $n\mapsto n + 1$ on $\mathbb N$).</p>

"2385852","2385936","<p>No, it does not.  Note that every open set $U$ is in $\mathcal{A}$ since $U = U \cup \emptyset$ and $\emptyset$ is closed; and similarly, every closed set $K$ is in $\mathcal{A}$.

<p>We now give a counterexample to show this is not true.  Consider the open set $U = (0, \infty)$ and the closed set $K = \{ 0 \} \cup \{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N}_+ \}$.  Then $U \cap K = \{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N}_+ \}$.  Suppose we had $U \cap K = V \cup L$ where $V$ is open and $L$ is closed.  Then for each $n$, $\frac{1}{n} \notin V$ since otherwise $U \cap K = V \cup L$ would contain an open neighborhood of $\frac{1}{n}$, which is a contradiction.

"2385860","2389095","<p>For those of you who can make do with an approximate solution. I found
one using small-angle approximations and Euler angles.</p>

<p>First, $T_{w \leftarrow c}$ can be expressed using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles#Rotation_matrix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tait-Bryan angles</a> in the
$YXZ$ order (yaw about $y$, pitch about $x'$, roll about $z^{\prime\prime}$).</p>

<p>In this order, condition (2) (maitaining the up direction) can be respected if we
restrict the roll angle to $0$.</p>

<p>For $\theta$ is the yaw angle about the $y$ axis and $\phi$ is the pitch angle
about the $x'$ axis, the corresponding transformation matrix is the following:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
T_{w \leftarrow c} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  C_{\theta} &amp; S_\theta S_\phi &amp; S_\theta C_\phi \\
  0          &amp; C_\phi          &amp; - S_\phi        \\
  -S_\theta  &amp; C_\theta S_\phi &amp; C_\theta C_\phi
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>But because the notation is getting tedious, from now on</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
T       = T_{w\leftarrow c} \\
p_{1_c} = p_{i_{camera}}    \\
p_{2_c} = p_{f_{camera}}    \\
p_w     = p_{world}.
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Recalling condition (1),</p>

<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:T}
p_w = T_2 p_{2_c} = T_1 p_{1_c}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Now, since we both know $p_{1_c}$ (the corresponding mouse position at the last
frame) and $p_{2_c}$ (the mouse position at the current frame). We know that</p>

<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:d}
p_{1_c} = D p_{2_c}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>And thus,</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
T_2 p_{2_c} = T_1 D p_{2_c} \\
\Rightarrow T_2 = T_1 D \\
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Great! If I can solve (or approximate) $D$, I can find $T_2$!</p>

<p>Since $p_{1_c}$ and $p_{2_c}$ are ""not far away"" from each other. We can assume
that they are some small $\Delta \theta$ and small $\Delta \phi$ away from one
another.</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
D =
\begin{bmatrix}
  C_{\Delta\theta}  &amp; S_{\Delta\theta} S_{\Delta\phi} &amp; S_{\Delta\theta} C_{\Delta\phi} \\
  0                 &amp; C_{\Delta\phi}                  &amp; - S_{\Delta\phi}                \\
  -S_{\Delta\theta} &amp; C_{\Delta\theta} S_{\Delta\phi} &amp; C_{\Delta\theta} C_{\Delta\phi}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-angle_approximation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">small-angle approximations</a>, we know</p>

<p>$$
\sin x \approx x \\
\cos x \approx 1 - \frac{x^2}{2}
$$</p>

<p>Knowing this and $p_{1_c} = D p_{2_c}$, we can get second degree polynomial
equations for $\Delta\theta$ and $\Delta\phi$. In fact, from the second row of
the matrix, we find that</p>

<p>$$
0 = - \frac{y_2}{2} \Delta\phi^2 -z_2 \Delta\phi + (y_2 - y_1) \\
$$</p>

<p>For which we can find two solutions. We will choose the one that respects the
small-angle assumption.</p>

<p>$$
\Delta\phi = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a} 
$$</p>

<p>And finally, from the first row of the matrix we get,</p>

<p>$$
0 = - \frac{x_2}{2} \Delta\theta^2 - (\Delta\phi y_2 + z_2 ( 1 - \frac{\Delta\phi ^2}{2})) \Delta\theta + (x2 - x1)
$$</p>

<p>For which we can find two solutions. And by choosing the one that respects the
small-angle assumption, we have successfully approximated $D$!</p>

<p>$$
\Delta\theta = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a} 
$$</p>

<p>Now that $D$ is approximated, we can calculate $T_2$ by adding $\Delta\theta$
and $\Delta\phi$ to the angles of $T_1$.</p>

"2385968","2385979","<p>This is all fake because you are manipulating a divergent series as if it were convergent. If we are allowed this, we can show that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n$ is equal to any real number.</p>

"
"2385976","2386841","<p>The fact that $t_i=0$ for some combinations of $n$ and $k$, and hence becomes independent of the values of $p_j$ already indicates that it is the sum over $q$ that makes this happen. To prove this we start with the general binomial expansion:
$$
(a + b)^m = \sum_{q=0}^m \binom{m}{q} b^{m-k} a^q
$$
for some integer $m \geq 1$ and apply the operation $a \frac{\partial}{\partial a}$ several times, say $l \geq 0$ times, on both the left and right hand side. This gives us 
$$
\left[a \frac{\partial}{\partial a}\right]^l (a + b)^m = \sum_{q=0}^m \binom{m}{q} b^{m-k} \left[a \frac{\partial}{\partial a}\right]^l a^q = \sum_{q=0}^m \binom{m}{q} b^{m-k} q^l a^q
$$
which is generally true for all $a,b$ and integers $l,m$. It is easy to prove/convince your self that for $l&lt;m$ the left hand side is divisible by $(a+b)^{m-l}$, and therefore if we insert $a=-1$, $b=1
$, and restrict $0 \leq l &lt; m$ that we get the general result
$$
\sum_{q=0}^m (-)^q \binom{m}{q} q^l = 0
$$
and from that it follows immediately that
$$
\sum_{q=0}^m (-)^q \binom{m}{q} (j+q)^l = 0
$$
for any value of $j$ and $0 \leq l &lt; m$. Setting $m = k n - j$ and $l=i-1$ we find that the $j$th term of $t_i$ is zero whenever $0 \leq i-1 &lt; k n - j$ and hence we get $$j &lt; kn-i+1$$
The sum over $j$ however is restricted by
$$1 \leq j \leq kn - k + 1 &lt; kn -i+1$$
for all $1 \leq i&lt;k$, and therefore every term in the summation over $j$ is identical zero, which gives the results that $t_i=0$ for $1 \leq i &lt; k$.</p>

<p>Note that neither the restriction $n \leq k$ nor the actual values of the $p_i$ are required for this to be true, but it might be imposed by the underlying problem of interest. </p>

"
"2386102","2387291","<p>Short answer: Yes, there is a representational face lattice. The tridiagonal Birkhoff polytope of dimension d is the polytope of tridiagonal, doubly stochastic $(d+1) \times (d+1)$ matrices $A$. We begin motivating the face representation system by numbering the $f_{d+2}$ vertices of $\Omega^t_{d+1}$ by reading off the values of the superdiagonal entries from upper left to lower right. As the possible values of these superdiagonal entries are 0 and 1, and there can be no pair of consecutive 1's, each vertex is numbered as the <strong>fibinary</strong> representation of the integers from 0 to $f_{d+2} - 1$ (where $f_n$ is the Fibonacci series). (The fibinary integer representation, which has been used in programming competitions, uses each possible string of 0's and 1's without leading zeroes and with no consecutive pair of 1's, listed in lexicographical order.) We'll retain leading zeroes, so that each vertex is represented by a string of d 0's and 1's - with no consecutive pair of 1's allowed (and each such string represents a vertex). We'll refer to the location of each 0 and 1 as a (fibinary) place, analogous to a decimal place.</p>

<p>Now, we will allow variables to occur in each place instead of 0's and 1's (retaining the rule about no consecutive pair of 1's). The variable X has possible values 0 or 1. $\Omega^t_{d+1}$ is represented by a string of d X's, meaning that $\Omega^t_{d+1}$ is the convex hull of all of the $f_{d+2}$ vertices - the solution space of the string of $d$ X's.</p>

<p>Consider the facets of $\Omega^t_{d+1}$ given by setting superdiagonal entries equal to zero. The facet given by $a_{i,i+1} = 0$ is represented by a string of X's, except with a 0 in the $i_{th}$ place - this facet is the convex hull of all vertices that have 0 in the $i_{th}$ place of their fibinary representation. Call these facets $Z_i$, $i$ = 1 to $d$.</p>

<p>Next consider the facets given by setting the main diagonal entries equal to zero. Because A is doubly stochastic, symmetric and tridiagonal, for 2 $\le$ $i$ $\le$ $d$, $a_{i,i} = 0$ if and only if ($a_{i-1,i} = 1$ or $a_{i,i+1} = 1$). The facet $a_{i,i} = 0$ is represented by a string of X's, except with YY in places $i - 1$ and $i$. Call these facets $Y_i$, $i$ = 2 to d. A string of Y's (of length two or more) is evaluated as a single <strong>zebra-striped</strong> field. That is, a Y-field represents alternating 1's and 0's, and thus has two possible solutions (beginning with 0 and beginning with 1, and alternating for the rest of the field). We have now represented all $2d - 1$ facets of $\Omega^t_{d+1}$.</p>

<p>More generally, the representations of all $\Omega^t_{d+1}$  faces are all the strings of $d$ symbols which may be 0, 1, X or Y, with Y occurring in fields comprising two or more places, with no pair of consecutive 1's and with 1 not adjoining any variable field. Each 'X' is called an X-field, and X and Y-fields are called variable fields. Each '0' and '1' is called a numeric field. (Adjoining Y-fields are separated by a comma. Field separation between X-fields, between X and Y-fields, and between an X or Y-field and a numeric field are implied; a comma is not needed.) The numeral 1 cannot adjoin a variable field (i.e., X or Y-field), because it is known that the adjacent place to 1 in any solution must be 0 (hence, the variable field would not be variable). Finally, we define a variable region as a maximal sub-string of adjoining variable fields with no numeric fields included.</p>

<p>Regarding the first sentence of the preceding paragraph, we will first prove by math induction that the representation of each $\Omega^t_{d+1}$ face is a string as described. The representations of $\Omega^t_{d+1}$ itself and its facets (dimension $d - 1$) are strings of $d$ symbols as described. Assume that all faces of dimension $d$ through $d - k$ have representations that are strings of d symbols which are 0, 1, X or Y, with Y occurring in fields of two or more places, with no pair of consecutive 1's, and with 1 not adjoining any variable field. To prove: faces of dimension $d - k - 1$ have such representations too. We'll evaluate all non-empty intersections of a ($d - k$)-face and a facet of $\Omega^t_{d+1}$, and thus evaluate all ($d - k - 1$)-faces along with (possibly) some lower dimensional faces.</p>

<p>Let F be a ($d - k$)-face of $\Omega^t_{d+1}$ (we'll use the same name for a face and its representation). Begin by considering non-empty intersections of F and facet $Z_i$, where F is not a face of $Z_i$. The $i_{th}$ place of F can't be a 0 (this would imply that F is a face of $Z_i$), and it can't be a 1 (this would produce an empty intersection). If the $i_{th}$ place of F is an X, the intersection $F \cap Z_i$ has the same representation as F, but with a 0 in the $i_{th}$ place - the representation criteria are met. If the $i_{th}$ place of F is a Y, we know that the $i_{th}$ place is within a Y-field (we'll call this F's Y-field); setting the $i_{th}$ place to 0 determines a zebra-striped numeric string of 0's and 1's in $F \cap Z_i$ to occupy the places of F's Y-field. We have some cases to consider:</p>

<p>Case 1: F's Y-field covers an even number of places. In Case 1a, the zebra-striped numeric string in $F \cap Z_i$ occupying the places of F's Y-field begins with 0 and ends with 1. If there are no additional variable fields adjoining F's Y-field to the right in the variable region, no further changes are necessary - $F \cap Z_i$ has the same representation as F, except with the zebra-striped numeric string beginning with 0 occupying the same places as F's Y-field. The criteria are met because the right end of F's Y-field is either the end of the representation, or a numeric region begins just to the right, starting with 0. If there are additional variable fields to the right of F's Y-field in the variable region, first consider the case that they are all even-length. In that case, each variable field to the right must be converted to a zebra-striped numeric string beginning with 0 and ending with 1, because the variable field just to its left was converted to a zebra-striped numeric string ending in 1. Again, the criteria are met because the right end of F's Y-field is either the end of the representation, or a numeric region begins just to the right, starting with 0. Say that one or more of the additional variable fields to the right of F's Y-field in the variable region is odd-length. Moving to the right from F's Y-field, each subsequent variable field must be converted to a zebra-striped numeric field beginning with 0, up to and including the first odd-length variable field encountered, which ends in a 0. Thus, the criteria are met.
In Case 1b, the zebra-striped numeric string in $F \cap Z_i$ occupying the places of F's Y-field begins with 1 and ends with 0. This case proceeds exactly like Case 1a, except moving to the left from F's Y-field instead of to the right. We conclude that the criteria are met in this case.</p>

<p>Case 2: F's Y-field covers an odd number of places. For Case 2a, both ends of the zebra-striped string occupying the places of F's Y-field are 0's. In this case, the representation of $F \cap Z_i$, is the same as that of F, except with the zebra-striped numeric string replacing the Y-field; the representation criteria are met.
For Case 2b, both ends of the zebra-striped numeric string occupying the places of F's Y-field are 1's. The argument for Case 2b is essentially a combination of Case 1a and 1b; conversion to zebra-striped numeric strings must occur both to the left and to the right. We conclude that the criteria are met in this case.</p>

<p>Now, consider non-empty intersections of F and facet $Y_i$, where F is not a face of $Y_i$. The $i_{th}$ and preceding place of F can't be 'YY', '01', or '10' (these would imply that F is a face of $Y_i$), and it can't be '00' (this would produce an empty intersection). If the $i_{th}$ and preceding place of F is 'XX', the intersection $F \cap Y_i$ has the same representation as F, but with a 'YY' in the $i_{th}$ and preceding place - the representation criteria are met (add a comma if this new Y-field adjoins another Y-field). 
If the $i_{th}$ and preceding place of F is 'XY', then the $i_{th}$ place is at the beginning of a Y-field in F. Solutions producing a 0 in the $i_{th}$ place imply that place $i - 1$ must be a 1 in the intersection (by definition of $Y_i$); solutions producing a 1 in the $i_{th}$ place imply that place $i - 1$ is 0 (by the prohibition on consecutive 1's). Thus, in $F \cap Y_i$, the string from place $i - 1$ to the end of the Y-string (in F) is zebra-striped. Thus, the representation of $F \cap Y_i$ has the same representation as F, but with the Y-field starting in the $i_{th}$ place extended back to begin in place $i - 1$ - the representation criteria are met (add a comma if this expanded Y-field adjoins another Y-field to the left). If the $i_{th}$ and preceding place of F is 'YX', then a similar argument applies; the representation of $F \cap Y_i$ has the same representation as F, but with the Y-field ending in place $i - 1$ extended forward to end in the $i_{th}$ place - the representation criteria are met (add a comma if this expanded Y-field adjoins another Y-field to the right).</p>

<p>Next case: the $i_{th}$ and preceding place if F is '0X'. The $i_{th}$ place of $F \cap Y_i$ must be 1, and the $(i+1)_{th}$ place must then be 0. If was already a 0 in F, then we've determined $F \cap Y_i$ and the criteria are met. If there is a variable field beginning with the $(i+1)_{th}$ place of F, we proceed with a similar argument as Case 1a of $F \cap Z_i$; conclude that the criteria are met. If the $i_{th}$ and preceding place of F is 'X0', we make a similar argument, working to the left instead of to the right, and conclude that the criteria are met.</p>

<p>Next case: the $i_{th}$ and preceding place if F is '0Y'. The $i_{th}$ place of $F \cap Y_i$ must be 1. A Y-field of F begins in place $i$; if it is even-length it ends in 0, and the representation of $F \cap Y_i$ is the same as F, except with a zebra-striped numeric string beginning with 1 occupying the same places as F's Y-field. If the Y-field of F beginning in place $i$ is odd-length, it ends in 1. We proceed with a similar argument as Case 1a of $F \cap Z_i$; conclude that the criteria are met. If the $i_{th}$ and preceding place of F is 'Y0', we make a similar argument, working to the left instead of to the right, and conclude that the criteria are met.</p>

<p>Having exhausted all cases, we proceed to the converse of the preceding argument by showing that each described representation corresponds to a face:</p>

<p>$\circ$  Each Y-field occupying places $i$ to $j$ is from the intersection of $Y_{i+1}$ to $Y_j$.</p>

<p>$\circ$  Each '010' in places $i$ through $i + 2$ is from the intersection of $Z_i$, $Z_{i+2}$, $Y_{i+1}$, and $Y_{i+2}$ (note that this case also covers longer zebra-striped strings beginning and ending with 0's, such as '01010').</p>

<p>$\circ$  '10' in places $1$ through $2$ is from the intersection of $Z_2$ and $Y_2$.</p>

<p>$\circ$  '01' in places $d - 1$ through $d$ is from the intersection of $Y_d$ and $Z_{d-1}$.</p>

<p>$\circ$  Each other '0' is from the corresponding $Z_i$.</p>

<p>$\circ$  Each 'X' place results from no $Z_i$ or $Y_i$ facet containing a '0' or 'Y' in that place being included in the intersection.</p>

<p>We turn to the evaluation of whether one $\Omega^t_{d+1}$ face is a face of another $\Omega^t_{d+1}$ face. Given representations of faces A and B of $\Omega^t_{d+1}$, A is a face of B if and only if all three of the following are true:</p>

<li><p>For each Y-field of B, the corresponding places of A are either all Y's, or zebra-striped numeric.</p></li>
<li><p>For each 0 (1) in B, there is a 0 (1) in the corresponding place of A.</p></li>
<li><p>For each comma in A's representation (between two Y-fields) there is a field separation in the corresponding place of B.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>First we'll assume A is a face of B and prove statements 1 - 3.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>'00' cannot appear within the places of A corresponding to B's Y-field, because any numeric solution to the Y-field must be zebra-striped. Say 'X' appears within the places of A corresponding to B's Y-field. The 'X' and an adjoining place within the places corresponding to B's Y-field could both be 0; the adjoining place is either one end of a variable field, or a 0; thus, a contradiction as any numeric solution to B's Y-field must be zebra-striped. Say both a Y and a 0 appear within the places corresponding to B's Y-field. The last place in the variable region between the Y and the 0 could be a 0, and it adjoins a 0 (at the near end of the numeric region next to the variable region). Likewise, this is a contradiction. The only remaining possibilities are for the corresponding places of A to be all Y's or zebra-striped numeric.</p></li>
<li><p>For each 0 in B, the corresponding place in A can't include the possibility of being solved as 1; thus the corresponding place can't be 1, X or Y; therefore, it must be 0. For each 1 in B, the corresponding place in A can't include the possibility of being solved as 0; thus the corresponding place can't be 0, X or Y; therefore, it must be 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Say there is a comma separating Y-fields in A ending in place $i$ and beginning in place $i + 1$, but there not a field separation between places $i$ and $i + 1$ in B; thus, places $i$ and $i + 1$ in B must be within a Y-field. Hence, there are two possible solutions of places $i$ and $i + 1$ in B; that is '01' and '10'. However, as they are in separate Y-fields in A, places $i$ and $i + 1$ could be '00', leading to a contradiction.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For the converse, we will assume that statements 1 - 3 are true. We'll show that every $\Omega^t_{d+1}$ facet that B is a face of, A is also a face of, implying that A is a face of B.</p>

<p>$\circ$  Each Y-field in B occupying places $i$ to $j$ is from the intersection of $Y_{i+1}$ to $Y_j$. As the corresponding places of A are either all Y's (thus A is also a face of each of these facets), or zebra-striped numeric (also implying A is a face of each of $Y_{i+1}$ to $Y_j$, plus a face of some Z-facets).</p>

<p>$\circ$  Each '010' in places $i$ through $i + 2$ of B is from the intersection of $Z_i$, $Z_{i+2}$, $Y_{i+1}$, and $Y_{i+2}$. '10' in places $1$ through $2$ (if it occurs in B) is from the intersection of $Z_2$ and $Y_2$. '01' in places $d - 1$ through $d$ (if it occurs in B) is from the intersection of $Y_d$ and $Z_{d-1}$. Each other '0' in B is from the corresponding $Z_i$. Because the numeric places of B are identical in A, A is also a face of each of the facets described in this paragraph that B is a face of.</p>

<p>$\circ$  We have described every $\Omega^t_{d+1}$ facet that B is a face of, and shown that A is also a facet of these. Therefore, A is a face of B.</p>

"
"2386212","2386852","<p>Actually this might be pretty straightforward. Let $1 \to A \overset{\iota}{\to} E \overset{\pi}{\to} G \to 1$ be any extension of $G$ by an abelian group $A$. Since $A$ is normal in $E$, any $e \in E$ determines an automorphism $a \mapsto eae^{-1}$. Moreover, since $A$ is abelian, replacing $e$ by $ea_1$ for some $a_1 \in A$ does not change this automorphism, i.e. the action of $e$ on $A$ only depends on the coset $eA$. Thus, we do in fact have a well-defined action
\begin{align*}
\theta:G \to \mathrm{Aut}(A) &amp;&amp; &amp;&amp; \theta_g(a) = eae^{-1} \text{ for any } e\in \pi^{-1}(g),
\end{align*}
(it is easy to check $g \mapsto \theta_g$ is still a homomorphism)</p>

<p>Next we need something like a 2-cocycle. For every $g \in G$, choose arbitrarily an $e(g)$ in the coset $\pi^{-1}(g)$. Since $e(g_1) e(g_2)$ and $e(g_1g_2)$ are equal under $\pi$, we get a map 
\begin{align*}
\psi : G \times G \to A &amp;&amp; \text{ defined by } &amp;&amp;e(g_1)e(g_2) = \psi(g_1,g_2) e(g_1g_2)
\end{align*}
To see what happens with the 2-cocycle identity, we should compute $e(g_1)e(g_2)e(g_3)$ in two different ways. Because $A$ is not necessarily central in $E$, things come out slightly differently.
\begin{align*}e(g_1)e(g_2)e(g_3) &amp;=\psi(g_1,g_2)e(g_1g_2)e(g_3) \\
&amp;= \psi(g_1,g_2)\psi(g_1g_2,g_3) e(g_1g_2g_3)
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}e(g_1)e(g_2)e(g_3) &amp;=e(g_1)\psi(g_2,g_3)e(g_2g_3) \\
&amp;= e(g_1)\psi(g_2,g_3)e(g_1)^{-1} e(g_1)e(g_2g_3) \\
&amp;= \theta_{g_1}(\psi(g_2,g_3)) \psi(g_1,g_2g_3) e(g_1,g_2g_3)
\end{align*}
so we find that $\psi$ satisfies the identity
$$\psi(g_1,g_2) \psi(g_1g_2,g_3) =\psi(g_1,g_2g_3) \theta_{g_1}(\psi(g_2,g_3))$$
a rather mild variation on the 2-cocycle identity. For convenience, we had may as well require that $e(1)=1$ and that $e(g^{-1}) =e(g)^{-1}$, since this is easy to enforce. This leads to the additional identities
$$\psi(g,g^{-1})=\psi(g,1)=\psi(1,g)=1$$</p>

<p>Now we just need to turn all this around:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $G$ be a group, $A$ an abelian group. suppose that we have the following data:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>A homomorphism $\theta : G \to \mathrm{Aut}(A)$</li>
  <li>a map $\psi : G \times G \to A$ satisfying $\psi(g_1,g_2) \psi(g_1g_2,g_3) =\psi(g_1,g_2g_3) \theta_{g_1}(\psi(g_2,g_3))$ and $\psi(g,g^{-1})=\psi(g,1)=\psi(1,g)=1$ (this second requirement can most likely be dispensed with, at the cost of complicating the formulas).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Define $E$ to be $A \times G$ as a set with product given by
  $$(a_1,g_1)(a_2,g_2) = (a_1 \theta_{g_1}(a_2) \psi(g_1,g_2),g_1g_2).$$
  (This group law is invented by thinking of $(a,g)$ as $ae(g)$ for $g \mapsto e(g)$ some set-theoretic section of $\pi$ defining $\psi$, and multiplying accordingly). There are some routine algebraic checks to show that this defines a group product:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>$(1,1)(a,g)=(1 \theta_1(a) \psi(1,g),1g)=(a,g)$</li>
  <li>$(a,g)(1,1) = (a \theta_g(1) \psi(g,1),g1)=(a,g)$</li>
  <li>$(\theta_g^{-1}(a^{-1}), g^{-1})(a,g)=(\theta_g^{-1}(a^{-1})\theta_g^{-1}(a)\psi(g^{-1},g), g^{-1}g)=(1,1)$</li>
  <li>$(a,g)(\theta_g^{-1}(a^{-1}), g^{-1})=(a \theta_g \theta_g^{-1}(a^{-1}) \psi(g,g^{-1}), gg^{-1}) =(1,1)$</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>and, finally,
  \begin{align*}
[(a_1,g_1)(a_2,g_2)](a_3,g_3) &amp;= (a_1 \theta_{g_1}(a_2)\psi(g_1,g_2),g_1g_2)(a_3,g_3) \\
&amp;=(a_1 \theta_{g_1}(a_2) \psi(g_1,g_2)\theta_{g_1g_2} (a_3)\psi(g_1g_2,g_3), g_1g_2g_3) \\
&amp;=(a_1 \theta_{g_1}(a_2)\theta_{g_1} \theta_{g_2}(a_3) \psi(g_1,g_2)\psi(g_1g_2,g_3), g_1g_2g_3) \\
&amp;=(a_1 \theta_{g_1}(a_2)\theta_{g_1} \theta_{g_2}(a_3) \psi(g_1,g_2g_3) \theta_{g_1}(\psi(g_2,g_3)), g_1g_2g_3) \\
&amp;=(a_1\theta_{g_1}(a_2\theta_{g_2}(a_3)\psi(g_2,g_3))\psi(g_1,g_2g_3),g_1g_2g_3) \\
&amp;=(a_1,g_1)(a_2 \theta_{g_2}(a_3)\psi(g_2,g_3),g_2g_3)\\
&amp;=(a_1,g_1)[(a_2,g_2)(a_3,g_3)]
\end{align*}</p>
  
  <p>It is quite obvious that $(a,g) \mapsto g$ is a surjective homomorphism whose kernel $\{(a,1) : a \in A\}$ is a isomorphic to $A$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strictly speaking, I did not prove that every extension of a group $G$ by an abelian group $A$ comes from the above construction, but this will surely be the case since, as discussed above, every extension $E$ determines such data $\theta$ and $\psi$ once one chooses a section $g \mapsto e(g) : G \to E$. So, one just needs to check the extension constructed out of that data is isomorphic to the original one.</p>

"2386331","2387242","<p>The easiest approach to determining convergence of this series would be to invoke the Limit Comparison test between this series and $\sum \frac{n}{n^{2p}}=\sum \frac{1}{n^{2p-1}}$, since for the latter we know precisely when it converges of diverges. But if you have to apply the Integral Test directly showing all work, then your solution is mostly correct&hellip; except for some errors and inaccuracies in it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the integral test to work, the function has to be decreasing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely correct! That's why you should immediately conclude that $p&gt;0$, since otherwise the terms are not decreasing. So from now on, we're assuming that $p&gt;0$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two critical points exist in the reals $x=1$, $x=−1$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That depends. From the second factor of $f'(x)$, we can also have $x^2=\frac{1}{1-2p}$. So if $p&lt;1/2$, then we have two more critical points $x=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-2p}}$. But fortunately that doesn't matter: $x=1$ is still the right-most critical point, and we can check that regardless of $p$ (however, remember that our $p&gt;0$) the derivative is negative on $[2,+\infty)$.</p>

  <p>We can observe that the integral is indeterminate when $p=1$</p>

<p>No, that's not what's going on here. Your whole calculation simply doesn't work (doesn't apply) when $p=1$. It's a completely different integral in that case. So instead you should keep the calculation that you did (and you did it correctly!), but with a comment that this is for the case when $p&gt;0$ and $p\neq1$. Then you will determine, as you did, that the series diverges for $p&lt;1$ and converges for $p&gt;1$.

<p>Because this is just an instance of the Babylonian method of computing square roots, later discovered to be a particular case of Newton's iterative method for the resolution of nonlinear equations.</p>

<p>So with closed eyes, this sequence converges to $\sqrt2$. You can easily verify it be assuming convergence, so that $a_{n-1}$ and $a_n$ become indiscernible, and</p>

<p>$$a=\frac{a+\dfrac2a}{2}$$ or $$a^2=2.$$ As the initial value is $1$, all terms are positive and convergence is to the positive root (if there is convergence, though).</p>

<hr>

<p>There is a simple way to explain that method, also known as Heron's formula.</p>

<p>Let $s$ be the number of which you want to extract the root, and let $a$ be an approximation by default. Then $$a&lt;\sqrt s\implies a':=\frac sa&gt;\sqrt s$$ so that $\dfrac sa$ is another approximation, by excess. Now if we take the arithmetic mean, we get a new approximation which is closer than the worse of the two,</p>

<p>$$a''=\frac{a+a'}2=\frac{a+\dfrac sa}{2}.$$</p>

<p>As can be shown, when you are close to the root, the sequence converges extremely rapidly.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>$$a=\color{green}{1.41}\implies a'=\color{green}{1.41}84397163121\cdots\implies a''=\color{green}{1.41421}9858156\cdots$$ while the true value is
$$\sqrt2=1.4142135623731\cdots$$</p>

<p>A note on convergence, for the skepticals (the method has been in use for at least two millenia).</p>

<p>Let $$x_n:=\frac{a_n}{\sqrt s}.$$</p>

<p>We have</p>

<p>$$\frac{x_{n+1}-1}{x_{n+1}+1}=\frac{x_n+\dfrac1{x_n}-2}{x_n+\dfrac1{x_n}+2}=\frac{(x_n-1)^2}{(x_n+1)^2}$$
and by induction</p>

<p>$$\frac{x_n-1}{x_n+1}=\left(\frac{x_0-1}{x_0+1}\right)^{2^n}.$$</p>

<p>This is an exact formula for the $n^{th}$ iterate, which proves convergence from any $x_0$ such that</p>

<p>$$\left|\frac{x_0-1}{x_0+1}\right|&lt;1.$$</p>

<p>This holds for all positive $x_0$.</p>

<h1>ISSUSE 1 MLE</h1>

<p><strong>The key to understand MLE is to think the same thing (jpdf) from other side, the PARAMETRIC SPACE side.</strong></p>

<p>Namely, you take the PARAMETRIC SPACE as the domain of the jpdf.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then, we denote this jpdf as $L(\theta;x_1,...,x_n), \theta\in\Theta.$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, for each possible $\theta_0$, there is a corresponding $L(\theta_0;x_1,...,x_n)$ which is a <strong>number</strong> because on the one hand $x_1,...,x_n$ are given, on the other hand $\theta$ is given. </p>

<p>You have known that the following step is maximizing this function.</p>

<p>Wait a minute. What is <em>maximizing</em>?
This word means that you choose the <em>maximum possible</em> (i.e. $L(\theta)$) case  among a bunch of cases (each $\theta$ in $\Theta$ representing a case).</p>

<p>Therefore, the cost function you choose is <em>legal</em>, if the maximizing of this cost function is equivalent to the maximizing of $L(\theta;x_1,...,x_n)$ among the cases $\theta\in\Theta$. </p>

<p>In fact, we often choose the cost function as $\ln L(\theta;x_1,...,x_n)$ because this is convenient for many distributions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Maximizing  $L(\theta)$ is equivalent to maximizing $\ln L(\theta)$, among all $\theta\in\Theta$.</p>
  
  <p>Hints: It it obviously that $\ln x$ is monotone incresing in $x$ when $x&gt;0$.
  Meanwhile, $L(\theta)&gt;0, \theta\in\Theta$.</p>
  
  <p>Take $\theta_0\in\Theta$, s.t. $L(\theta_0)=\max_{\theta\in\Theta}L(\theta).$ Then $\ln L(\theta_0)=\max_{\theta\in\Theta}\ln L(\theta)$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, the MLE method is not the BEST. Consider the following example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider $(X_1,..,X_n)\stackrel{iid}{\sim}N(\mu,\sigma^2)$.</p>
  
  <p>We can calculate the MLE of $\sigma^2$ is $\hat\sigma^2=\dfrac1n\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar X)^2$, which is obviously biased.</p>

<p>On parameters of a distribution, there are point estimation and interval estimation.</p>

<p>What you mentioned is point estimation, in which the BEST estimator is called <strong>UMVUE</strong> (uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator).</p>

<p>The MLE method is not a approach to get UMVUE directly (as we've shown that MLE is sometimes biased) but an intuitive one. </p>

<p>On UMVUE, there are too many theories. You may google <strong>Lehmann-Scheffe</strong> theorem (a way to find UMVUE) for more details.</p>

"2386414","2386427","<p>You have not applied the root test correctly. Although it is quite true that $3/(n^2 + 1)$ is decreasing, that does not imply that the $n$-th root of it is. In fact, </p>

<p>So, three equations really. Moreover, that equation on the diagonal only has
two unknowns. Therefore it already gives you one unknown in terms of the other. Unless it is identically zero.</p>

<p>Case 1: The diagonal equation is identically zero. Therefore $b_{12}=b_{21}=0$. Since $B$ is non-scalar, it follows that $a_{12}=a_{21}=0$. And the space of solutions is $2$-dimensional, at most.</p>

<p>Case 2: The diagonal equation is not identically zero. In this case $a_{12}$ determines $a_{21}$, or the other way around. This is because only those two unknowns are in present in that equation. Having $a_{12}$ and $a_{21}$, the remaining equations express $a_{11}$ in terms of $a_{21}$ or the other way around.</p>

"2386444","2386844","<p>If $M$ is a manifold, let $nM$ denote the connected sum of $n$ copies of $M$.</p>

<p>First note that if $X \to Y$ is a $k$-sheeted covering, then $\chi(X) = k\chi(Y)$. So if $X$ is a four-sheeted covering of $5\mathbb{RP}^2$, $\chi(X) = 4\chi(5\mathbb{RP}^2)$. Now recall that $\chi(n\mathbb{RP}^2) = n - 2$, so $\chi(X) = 4(5 - 2) = 12$. If $X$ is non-orientable, then $X = n\mathbb{RP}^2$ for some $n$. But $\chi(X) = 12$ and $\chi(X) = \chi(n\mathbb{RP}^2) = n - 2$, therefore $n = 14$. That is, the only non-orientable surface which can be a four-sheeted cover of $5\mathbb{RP}^2$ is $14\mathbb{RP}^2$. Note, we still need to check whether $14\mathbb{RP}^2$ does cover $5\mathbb{RP}^2$ or not.</p>

<p>Here's a useful trick: if $\pi: X' \to X$ is a $k$-sheeted covering, then there is a $k$-sheeted covering $p: X'\# kY \to X\# Y$.</p>

<p>To see this, let $U$ be an evenly covered open disc in $X$, then $X'\setminus\pi^{-1}(U)$ is $X'$ with $k$ disjoint open discs removed. Let $V$ be an open disc in $Y$. Gluing a copy of $Y\setminus V$ to each boundary sphere of $X'\setminus\pi^{-1}(U)$, and a copy of $Y\setminus V$ to the boundary sphere of $X\setminus U$, the $k$-sheeted covering $X'\setminus\pi^{-1}(U) \to X\setminus U$ extends to a $k$-sheeted covering $X'\# kY \to X\# Y$.</p>

<p>Returning to the problem at hand, recall that $3\mathbb{RP}^2 = T^2\#\mathbb{RP}^2$, so $5\mathbb{RP}^2 = T^2\# 3\mathbb{RP}^2$. There is a four-sheeted covering $T^2 \to T^2$ (for example, $(z, w) \mapsto (z^4, w)$), so by the above construction, there is a four-sheeted covering $T^2\# 12\mathbb{RP}^2 \to T^2\# 3\mathbb{RP}^2$, i.e. $14\mathbb{RP}^2 \to 5\mathbb{RP}^2$.</p>

<p>If the deck transformations of the four-sheeted covering map $T^2 \to T^2$ are generated by a $90$ degree rotation (which is the case for the example I gave), you can visualise the construction of the four-sheeted covering of $T^2\# 3\mathbb{RP}^2$ as follows: </p>

<p>$$3\mathbb{RP}^2 \\
\# \\
3\mathbb{RP}^2\ \#\ \ T^2\ \#3\ \mathbb{RP}^2 \\
\# \\
3\mathbb{RP}^2$$</p>

<hr>

<p>These arguments can be used to show the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $X$ and $Y$ be two closed, connected surfaces, either both orientable or both non-orientable. Then there is a $k$-sheeted covering $X \to Y$ if and only if $\chi(X) = k\chi(Y)$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As every covering of an orientable space is orientable, the only case left to consider is orientable coverings of non-orientable surfaces.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $X$ and $Y$ be two closed, connected surfaces, with $X$ orientable and $Y$ non-orientable. Then there is a $k$-sheeted covering $X \to Y$ if and only if $\chi(X) = k\chi(Y)$ and $k$ is even.</p>

"
"2386530","2389276","<p>This is not a complete answer to your question, but more an argument which should demonstrate that the property of being quotient-dense seems to have very few to do with the overall density of $S$.</p>

<p>Especially, I found two counterexamples to my former conjecture (see comments to your question) that $S=\{s_n\mid n\in\Bbb N\}$ is quotient-dense if and only if the always increasing sequence $s_n$ is sub-exponential. One of them is another counterexample to your own conjecture, but of another kind as the one given in the comments.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>$s_n$ is sub-exponential, but $S$ is not quotient-dense</strong></p>

<p>This <em>not</em> quotient dense set $S$ is generated by a sequence $s_n&lt;7n$, obviously sub-exponential. To write down the set nicely, I will write $[a,b]_\Bbb N$ for the range of natural numbers from $a$ to $b$, e.g. $[1,6]_\Bbb N$ is short for $1,2,3,4,5,6$. Now we can define</p>

<p>$$S=\{[a_0,b_0]_\Bbb N,\;[a_1,b_1]_\Bbb N,\;[a_2,b_2]_\Bbb N,\;...\}$$</p>

<p>with $a_0=b_0=1$ and recursively $a_i=3b_{i-1}$ and $b_i=\lfloor 3/2\cdot a_i \rfloor$. The following picture shows the generating sequence $s_n$ up to $n\approx 80$ together with the bounding linear function (in gray).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RTNPw.png"" width=""400"" /></p>

<p>It remains to show that this sequence is bounded by $7n$ and $S$ is not quotient-dense. The former statement is not hard to show but it is annoying to do nicely (I tried). So, I will only show the latter one:</p>

<p>Note that $a_0=b_0&lt;a_1&lt;b_1&lt;a_2&lt;b_2&lt;\cdots$. We will see that no rational number $x\in(1/3,2/3)$ can be expressed by quotients $p,q\in S$. Lets say $p\in[a_i,b_i]_\Bbb N$ and $q\in[a_j,b_j]_\Bbb N$. Because we want to build a rational $&lt;1$, we can assume $i\leq j$. At first assume $i&lt;j$. Then</p>

<p>$$\frac pq\leq\frac {b_i}{a_j}\leq\frac{b_{j-1}}{a_j}=\frac{b_{j-1}}{3b_{j-1}}=\frac13.$$</p>

<p>In the other case $i=j$ we have</p>

<p>$$\frac pq\geq\frac {a_i}{b_i}=\frac {a_i}{\lfloor 3/2\cdot a_i\rfloor}\geq\frac {a_i}{3/2\cdot a_i}=\frac23.$$</p>

<p>So we indeed have this gap $(1/3, 2/3)$ that we cannot fill. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>$s_n$ is growing exponentially, but $S$ is quotient-dense</strong></p>

<p>At first note that it suffices to show that any number in $[0,1]$ can be approximated by $s_n/s_m$. Because given a number $x&gt;1$, we can instead approximate $1/x\in(0,1)$ by a sequence $s_{n(i)}/s_{m(i)}$ and then convert this via exchanging nominator and denominator to the sequence $s_{m(i)}/s_{n(i)}$ which converges to $x$.</p>

<p>Choose an enumeration $p_i/q_i,i=1,2,3,...$ of all rational numbers in $(0,1)$. If all of these numbers are representable from $S$, then all of $[0,1]$ can be approximated. Now choose $s_1=1$ (we skip $s_0$ for no real reason) and define recursively</p>

<p>$$s_{2i}=2p_i \cdot s_{2i-1},\qquad s_{2i+1}=2q_i \cdot s_{2i-1}.$$</p>

<p>Note that because $p_i&lt;q_i$, we indeed have $s_{2i}&lt;s_{2i+1}$. Now we have $s_{2i}/s_{2i+1}=p_i/q_i$, hence every rational numbers in $(0,1)$ can be generated from this sequence. We have to show that the sequence is growing exponentially, but this is easy:</p>

<p>$$s_{2i+1}=2q_i\cdot s_{2i-1}\geq 2s_{2i-1}$$</p>

<p>which is an exponentially growing sub-sequence. And because $s_{2i+1}=s_{n(i)}$ with linearly growing $n(i)$, this suffices to imply that $s_n$ itself grows exponentially.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Moral of the story</strong></p>

<p>If you want a nice characterization of quotient-dense sets, you should not look at properties like density. This involves your conjecture on $\sum_n s_n&lt;\infty$ and my conjecture about sub-exponential growth.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Actually any arbitrarily sparse set $S=\{s_n\mid n\in\Bbb N\}$ can be made quotient-dense by at most ""doubling its density"". Take an enumeration of the rationals $p_n/q_n$ as above. Then we have this new quotent-dense set</p>

<p>$$S':=\{p_ns_n\mid n\in\Bbb N\}\cup\{q_n s_n\mid n\in\Bbb N\}.$$</p>

<p>This new set has ""dense"" clusters of two elements and big gaps between these clusters. So it seems to have more to do with local clustering than global structure.</p>

	2n+1+2\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+1}-(x+y)&lt;2\sqrt{xy}&lt;4n+2-(x+y)\qquad\qquad (2)
$$
    Since $x+y\geq 2n+1$ we have $x+y=2n+1+k$ for some $k\geq 0$. Substituting $x+y$ into (2) we obtain
$$
2\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+1}-k&lt;2\sqrt{xy}&lt;2n+1-k\qquad\qquad (3)
  $$
    From the above inequality we have $k&lt;2n+1$. Therefore
    $$
k\leq 2n&lt;2\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+1}.
$$
    From here it implies that the left hand side of (3) is positive. Taking square both sides of (3) we get
    $$
(2\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+1}-k)^2&lt;4xy&lt;(2n+1-k)^2.
$$
   On the other hand
$$
	(2\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+1}-k)^2-((2n+1-k)^2-1)=(4n(n+1)+k^2-4k\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+1})-(4n^2+4n+1+k^2-2k(2n+1)-1)
$$
$$
\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad=2k(2n+1-2\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+1})
$$
$$
\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad=2k(\sqrt{n}-\sqrt{n+1})^2\geq 0.
$$
Hence
 $$
 (2n+1-k)^2-1\leq (2\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+1}-k)^2&lt;4xy&lt;(2n+1-k)^2.
 $$
This is an absurd.</p>

<p>For a concrete example, consider $\Bbb R^2$ as $X$ and $\{(r,0)\mid r\in\Bbb R\}$ as $Y$.

"
"2386588","2386744","<p>Well, this tree will look sort of like the full binary tree $2^{&lt;\kappa}$, except that all of the nodes with infinitely many $1$s are missing.  Let's call your tree $T$.  Then every branch of $T$ can be extended to a branch of $2^{&lt;\kappa}$, i.e. a function $\kappa\to 2$.  But given a function $\kappa\to 2$, not all of its restrictions will be elements of $T$: only those with only finitely many $1$s.  That is, the restriction forgets about all of the values of the function $\kappa\to 2$ after the first $\omega$ $1$s.</p>

<p>Thus the branches of $T$ are in bijection with subsets $S$ of $\kappa$ of order type $\leq\omega$.  Explicitly, given such a subset $S$, you get a branch by taking all initial segments of the characteristic function of $S$ prior to the supremum of its first $\omega$ elements.  Conversely, given a branch $B$, the union of all the elements of $B$ is a function $f:\alpha\to 2$ for some $\alpha\leq\kappa$.  If $\alpha&lt;\kappa$, the fact that $B$ cannot be extended by adding $f$ as another member means that $f$ takes the value $1$, which means $f$ is the characteristic function of a cofinal subset of $\alpha$ of order-type $\omega$.  If $\alpha=\kappa$, then $f$ must similarly be either the characteristic function of a finite subset of $\kappa$ or the characteristic function of a cofinal subset of $\kappa$ of order-type $\omega$.  Combining all the cases together, $f$ comes from a subset of $\kappa$ of order-type $\leq\omega$.</p>

<p>Let us now count how many branches there are (assuming $\kappa$ is an infinite cardinal).  There are $\kappa$ finite subsets of $\kappa$.  The elements of a subset of order-type $\omega$ can be chosen one-by-one in increasing order, and at each step you have $\kappa$ choices (there are still $\kappa$ elements greater than the last one you chose).  So there are $\kappa^{\aleph_0}$ subsets of order-type $\omega$.  In total, then, there are $\kappa+\kappa^{\aleph_0}=\kappa^{\aleph_0}$ branches.</p>

"2386602","2386618","<p>Let's consider the first series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (n!)^2 x^{n^2}$. The easiest way to find the radius of convergence is to forget this is a power series and treat $x$ as a constant. Let's assume $x &gt; 0$ so that the terms of the series are positive and we can use any test we wish for the convergence/divergence of a non-negative series. Alternatively, replace $x$ with $|x|$ and check for absolute convergence instead. Using the ratio test, we get the expression
$$ \frac{(n+1)!^2 x^{(n+1)^2}}{(n!)^2 x^{n^2}} = (n+1)^2 x^{2n + 1}. $$
This expression converges if $0 &lt; x &lt; 1$ to $0$ while it diverges if $x \geq 1$. This implies that the series converges if $0 &lt; x &lt; 1$ and diverges if $x \geq 1$. But this is a power series so the only possible value for the radius of convergence is $R = 1$ (because it should converge when $|x| &lt; R$ and diverge when $|x| &gt; R$).</p>

"2386608","2386623","<p>The ""dimension is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial"" thing only works when you have a <em>single element</em> that generates the whole extension. Take, for instance, $\alpha = \omega + 2^{1/3}$. It has minimal polynomial
$$
x^6 - 3 x^5 + 6 x^4 - 11 x^3 + 12 x^2 + 3 x + 1
$$
over $\Bbb Q$ and therefore generates an extension of degree $6$. Clearly $\Bbb Q(\alpha)\subseteq \Bbb Q(\omega, 2^{1/3})$, so the degree of $Q(\omega, 2^{1/3})$ cannot be $5$.</p>

<p>Using this, and the multiplicative formula for the extension degrees which you've already used in your question, we can see that if you have several distinct elements that generate a field extension, we <em>multiply</em> the degrees of their respective minimal polynomials instead of adding them.</p>

<p>Or... almost. We multiply the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\omega$ over $\Bbb Q$ with the degree of the minimal polynomial of $2^{1/3}$ over $\Bbb Q(\omega)$ (or vice versa).

"
"2386612","2386671","<p>Your approach is correct, but here's a way to arrive at the same result with less computation.  Considering $A^T A$ as a linear transformation, we have the following factorization.
$$
\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}} \R^3 \overset{A}{\longrightarrow} \R \overset{A^T}{\longrightarrow} \R^3
$$
This shows that the map factors through a $1$-dimensional space, so its rank is $\leq 1$.  Assuming $A$ is not the zero matrix, then the rank of $A^T A$ is $1$, so its kernel has dimension $3-1 = 2$.  Thus two of the eigenvalues must be $0$, and from your trace formula $\DeclareMathOperator{\tr}{tr} \sum_i \lambda_i = \tr(A^T A) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2$, we see that the third eigenvalue must be $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$.  Note that this approach generalizes and can be used for $A \in M_{1 \times n}(\R)$ for any $n$.</p>

<p>The factorization above also indicates how to find the eigenvectors.  The kernel of $A$ is $2$-dimensional, and these will be the eigenvectors with eigenvalue $0$.  (Since $\DeclareMathOperator{\img}{img} \ker(A) = \img(A^T)^\perp$, this agrees with Daniel's answer.)  Since $\ker(A)^\perp = \img(A^T)$, the remaining eigenvector is any nonzero multiple of $A^T$.</p>

"2386628","2386873","<p>I think there's been a misinterpretation of the problem.
First of all, to be clear since this isn't written in the post, we have a function $f:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by
$$f(x,y) = 3 - 3x^2 - y^2 \, .$$
The problem is to find the point in the plane such that $\lvert \nabla f \rvert$ is maximized subjected to the constraint that $x^2+y^2=1$.</p>

<p>However, you've written one of your constraint equations as
$$3 - 3x^2 - y^2 = 0$$
which could also be written as $f(x,y)=0$.
That's a much stronger constraint than what's in the problem, and I don't think it's what the problem intends.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to solve the problem.
We could use Lagrange multipliers or we can parametrize the circle and use simple calculus.
Let's do that latter.
The thing we're trying to maximize is
$$\lvert \nabla f \rvert = \lvert -6x\hat{x} -2y\hat{y} \rvert = \sqrt{36x^2 + 4y^2} \, . $$
To simplify our life, let's maximize $g(x,y) \equiv \lvert \nabla f \rvert^2$ instead:
$$g(x,y) = 36x^2 + 4y^2 \, . $$
Now normally to find an extremum we'd compute $\partial g / \partial x$ and $\partial g / \partial y$, set them to zero, and solve for $x$ and $y$.
However, we can't do that here because we have a constraint.
Fortunately, it's easy to respect the constraint by putting $y^2 = 1 - x^2$, giving
$$g(x) = 36x^2 + 4(1 - x^2) = 4 - 32x^2$$
so
$$dg/dx =0 \longrightarrow x = 0 \, .$$</p>

"
"2386725","2386737","<p>Here's a slightly more general answer to your question.</p>

<p>Given categories and functors as shown:
$$\mathcal{A} \overset{F}{\to} \mathcal{B} \overset{G}{\underset{H}{\rightrightarrows}} \mathcal{C} \overset{K}{\to} \mathcal{D}$$
and a natural transformation $\theta : G \to H$, we can define new natural transformations
$$\theta_F : GF \to HF \quad \text{and} \quad K\theta : KG \to KH$$
by defining
$$(\theta_F)_A = \theta_{F(A)} : GF(A) \to HF(A) \quad \text{and} \quad (K\theta)_B = K(\theta_B) : KG(B) \to KH(B)$$
for all $A \in \mathrm{ob}(\mathcal{A})$ and $B \in \mathrm{ob}(\mathcal{B})$.</p>

<p>These are just definitions of what is meant by '$\theta_F$' and '$K\theta$'; but as you suggest, identity natural transformations are involved: indeed,
$$\theta_F = \theta \star \mathrm{id}_F \quad \text{and} \quad K\theta = \mathrm{id}_K \star \theta$$
where $\star$ is <a href=""https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/horizontal+composition"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">horizontal composition</a> of natural transformations. Horizontal composition is slightly trickier to define, so most authors define $\theta_F$ and $K\theta$ independently.</p>
"
"2386729","2389185","<p>If $\hat u$ is the Laplace transform, then $\hat u(i\omega) = \mathcal F u(\omega)$, and $\mathcal F u$ is the Fourier-transform of $u$. If I understood your post correctly, you are actually working with Fourier transforms most of the time. This is good, since we have a couple of nice properties about norms in this context.</p>

<p>If we start from $\hat y = G\hat u$, but the arguments are $i\omega$ anyway, we can instead look at $\mathcal F(y) = G\mathcal F (u)$.</p>

<p>We could proceed by using the continuity of $\mathcal F^{-1}$ from $L^1$ into the space of continuous functions decaying towards infinity, equipped with the maximum norm (usually you will find this statement only for $\mathcal F$, but since $\mathcal F$ and $\mathcal F^{-1}$ behave exactly the same, this is ok):
$$\|y\|_{L^\infty} = \|\mathcal F^{-1}\mathcal F y\|_{L^\infty}\le\frac1{\sqrt{2\pi}}\|\mathcal F y\|_{L^1} = \frac1{\sqrt{2\pi}}\|G\mathcal F (u)\|_{L^1}\le \|G\|_{H^2}\|\mathcal Fu\|_{L^2}= \|G\|_{H^2}\|u\|_{L^2}.$$
The first inequality comes from the aforementioned <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform#Uniform_continuity_and_the_Riemann.E2.80.93Lebesgue_lemma"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">continuity</a> of $\mathcal F^{-1}:L^1\to (C, \|.\|_{L^\infty})$. The next estimate is due to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cauchy-Schwarz</a> inequality. The last step uses that the Fourier transform is an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform#Plancherel_theorem_and_Parseval.27s_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">isometry</a> on $L^2$, i.e. it does not change the norm (a property you have used in your question already).</p>

<p><em>Remark 1</em>: In more detail, the first estimate is obtained by the following considerations:
$$\sqrt{2\pi}\cdot\|y\|_{L^\infty} = \sup_{x\in\mathbb R}\left|\int_{\mathbb R}e^{i t x} \mathcal F[y(t)]d t\right|\le \sup_{x\in\mathbb R}\int_{\mathbb R}|e^{i t x} |\cdot|\mathcal F[y(t)]|d t = \int_{\mathbb R}|\mathcal F[y] |dx = \|\mathcal Fy\|_{L^1}.$$
The constant $\sqrt{2\pi}$ comes from the choice of the Fourier transform $\mathcal F y = \frac 1{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{\mathbb R} e^{-ixt}y(t) dt$. This makes $\mathcal F$ an isometry on $L^2$, but introduces the constant in the first estimate. If you wish to choose another definition of the Fourier transform you should adapt the constants accordingly.</p>

<p><em>Remark 2</em>: As a mathematician, I would say that what you denote by $\|G\|_{H^2}$ is nothing else than an $L^2$-norm on matrix-values functions. $H^2$ is commonly reserved for a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_space#The_case_p_.3D_2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sobolev space</a>.</p>

"2386730","2386792","<p>I think any such proof would revolve around the same ideas. But here's how we can phrase it to stay close enough to your original proof.</p>

<p>After</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&hellip; we have to prove $H\subset K$ or $K\subset H$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>we can insert the following: If $H\subset K$, we're done. So let's assume that $H\not\subset K$ (in which case our goal is to show that $K\subset H$). Then instead of</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $x\in H$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it's better to pick $x\in H\setminus K$. Now we can pick any $y\in K$, as you did. And as in your proof (but I just want to give a name to the new element):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then $z=x*y\in H\cup K$ for $H\cup K$ is a subgroup $\implies$ $x*y\in H$ or $x*y\in K$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If $z=x*y\in K$, then $x=zy^{-1}\in K$, since both $z\in K$ and $y^{-1}\in K$. But this is impossible because we chose $x\in H\setminus K$. Therefore $z=x*y\in H$. But then $y=x^{-1}z\in H$, since both $x^{-1}\in H$ and $z\in H$.</p>

<p>Thus we've shown that for any element $y\in K$, we have $y\in H$, i.e. $K\subset H$.</p>

<p>Only numerical methods will solve the problem.</p>

<p>Whet you can notice is that $$f'(t)=44.694 e^{-3.82 t}-44.7678 e^{-26.18 t}$$ cancels for $x\approx 0.0000738$ and the second derivative test shows that this is a minimum. So, you have a unique solution to the equation.</p>

"2386768","2387100","<p>For simplicity, let's use
$$\begin{array}{l}

( a_x , a_y , a_z ) = \vec{a} \\
( b_x , b_y , b_z ) = \vec{b}
\end{array}$$</p>

<p>Let's parametrise the line using $s \in \mathbb{R}$ and the line segment using $t \in \mathbb{R}$, $0 \le t \le 1$:
$$\vec{P}_0 + s \vec{d} = (1 - t) \vec{a} + t \vec{b} = \vec{a} + t \left ( \vec{b} - \vec{a} \right)$$
i.e.
$$\begin{cases}
p_x + s d_x = (1 - t) a_x + t b_x \\
p_y + s d_y = (1 - t) a_y + t b_y \\
p_z + s d_z = (1 - t) a_z + t b_z \end{cases}$$
You have three equations, but only two unknowns. Furthermore, because all real $s$ are acceptable, you only need to solve for $t$, and verify it $0 \le t \le 1$. There are three solutions, subscripted by which coordinate pair is used in the solution:
$$t_{xy} = \frac{ d_y ( a_x - p_x ) - d_x ( a_y - p_y ) }{ d_y ( a_x - b_x ) - d_x ( a_y - b_y ) } \tag{1}\label{1}$$
$$t_{xz} = \frac{ d_z ( a_x - p_x ) - d_x ( a_z - p_z ) }{ d_z ( a_x - b_x ) - d_x ( a_z - b_z ) } \tag{2}\label{2}$$
$$t_{yz} = \frac{ d_z ( a_y - p_y ) - d_y ( a_z - p_z ) }{ d_z ( a_y - b_y ) - d_y ( a_z - b_z ) } \tag{3}\label{3}$$
For numerical accuracy, I suggest you calculate all three denominators first, and calculate $t$ using the formula corresponding to the largest denominator in magnitude (absolute value).</p>

<p>If all three denominators are zero, the line and the line segment do not intersect. (This can also occur if $\vec{P}_0 = \vec{d}$ or $\vec{a} = \vec{b}$ or both.)</p>

<p>In case you wish to check for the intersection between two line segments, here are the corresponding formulae for $s$:
$$s_{xy} = \frac{ a_x ( b_y - p_y ) - b_x ( a_y - p_y ) + p_x ( a_y - b_y ) }{ d_y ( a_x - b_x ) - d_x ( a_y - b_y ) } \tag{4}\label{4}$$
$$s_{xz} = \frac{ a_x ( b_z - p_z ) - b_x ( a_z - p_z ) + p_x ( a_z - b_z ) }{ d_z ( a_x - b_x ) - d_x ( a_z - b_z ) } \tag{5}\label{5}$$
$$s_{yz} = \frac{ a_y ( b_z - p_z ) - b_y ( a_z - p_z ) + p_y ( a_z - b_z ) }{ d_z ( a_y - b_y ) - d_y ( a_z - b_z ) } \tag{6}\label{6}$$</p>

<p>Note that the corresponding formulae for $s$ have the same denominators; that is, $\eqref{1}$ and $\eqref{4}$ have the same denominators, $\eqref{2}$ and $\eqref{5}$ have the same denominators, and $\eqref{3}$ and $\eqref{6}$ have the same denominators. (This means that if a solution for $t$ exists, a solution exists for $s$ also. In OP's case $s$ does not matter, because it is the parameter for an infinite line, and any real $s$ is acceptable.)</p>

<p>If you find $t$, and $0 \le t \le 1$, the line and the line segment intersect at $\vec{v}$,
$$\vec{v} = (1-t) \vec{a} + t \vec{b}$$
i.e.
$$\begin{cases}
v_x = (1-t) a_x + t b_x \\

"2386814","2394015","<p>Additional answer in  response to new query by OP  asking for the same
statistic for a  multiset on $n$ different  elements with multiplicity
$r$ of the first element.  Call this $E_{a,b,r}(n,k).$ We will provide
a  recurrence  that  yields  a  practical  means  of  computing  these
numbers.  We  obtain from  first  principles  and applying  the  Polya
Enumeration Theorem the answer</p>

<p>$$[A_1^r A_2 \cdots A_n] 
Z(P_k)\left(\sum_{p=a}^b [z^p] 
\sum_{q=0}^r z^q A_1^q \prod_{j=2}^n (1+z A_j) \right).$$</p>

<p>This formula  has the  poorest complexity  of the  three that  we will
present  here  and is  used  mainly  to  verify correctness  on  small
arguments of the others that  were obtained.  Applying the exponential
fromula we obtain the OGF</p>

<p>$$G(w) = \exp\left(\sum_{l\ge 1} (-1)^{l-1} \frac{w^l}{l}
\left(\sum_{p=a}^b [z^p] 
\sum_{q=0}^r z^q A_1^{ql} \prod_{j=2}^n (1+z A_j^l)
\right)\right).$$</p>

<p>Splitting into $l=1$ and $l\ge 2$ we see that in the latter case
only the constant term from the product contributes and we obtain</p>

<p>$$G(w) = \exp\left(w\sum_{p=a}^b [z^p] 
\sum_{q=0}^r z^q A_1^q \prod_{j=2}^n (1+z A_j) \right)
\\ \times \exp\left(\sum_{l\ge 2} (-1)^{l-1} \frac{w^l}{l}
\left(\sum_{p=a}^b [z^p] 
\sum_{q=0}^r z^q A_1^{ql}\right)\right).$$</p>

<p>This last formula is already  suitable for practical computations, but
mostly in the same  range as the first one as  the complexity is about
the same.   We set the upper  limit to $l=r$ and  extract coefficients
through  the Taylor  series in  the variables  $A_j.$ OP  asked for  a
recurrence  however  and  we  continue with  this  goal.   <strong>Important
remark.</strong> All  coefficient extraction  in these computations  with the
exception of the initial repertoire is done through Taylor series i.e.
<em>differentiation.</em> While we are dealing with polynomials, we must note
however that  we get  exponential increase when  we expand  these into
constituent terms. The algorithms that we present here require this as
a precondition and would otherwise not work. <P></p>

<p>Now let $[a,b]\cap [0,r] = [c_1, c_2]$ to get</p>

<p>$$G(w) = \exp\left(w\sum_{p=a}^b [z^p] 
\sum_{q=0}^r z^q A_1^q \prod_{j=2}^n (1+z A_j) \right)
\\ \times \exp\left(\sum_{l\ge 2} (-1)^{l-1} \frac{w^l}{l}
\left(\sum_{p=c_1}^{c_2} A_1^{pl}\right)\right).$$</p>

<p>This is</p>

<p>$$G(w) = \exp\left(w\left(- \sum_{p=c_1}^{c_2} A_1^{p}  +
\sum_{p=a}^b [z^p] 
\sum_{q=0}^r z^q A_1^q \prod_{j=2}^n (1+z A_j) \right) \right)
\\ \times \exp\left(\sum_{l\ge 1} (-1)^{l-1} \frac{w^l}{l}
\left(\sum_{p=c_1}^{c_2} A_1^{pl}\right)\right).$$</p>

<p>We put</p>

<p>$$A = - \sum_{p=c_1}^{c_2} A_1^{p}  +
\sum_{p=a}^b [z^p] 
\sum_{q=0}^r z^q A_1^q \prod_{j=2}^n (1+z A_j).$$</p>

<p>and $G(w)$ finally simplifies to</p>

<p>$$G(w) = \prod_{p=c_1}^{c_2} (1+wA_1^p) \times
\exp\left(w A \right).$$</p>

<p>This  closed  form  is  the  first  one  to  be  really  suitable  for
computations, the  complexity here  is of  a lower  order than  of the
first two  we saw and  indeed it  was used in  the Maple code  that we
include below.  We now use it  to establish a recurrence and introduce
$G_k = [w^k]  G(w)$ which is the OGF before  extraction of $[A_1^r A_2
\cdots  A_n].$ Differentiating  and actually  doing the  extraction we
find</p>

<p>$$(k+1) G_{k+1} = 
[w^k]  \sum_{p=c_1}^{c_2} \frac{A_1^p} {1+wA_1^p} G(w)
+ [w^k] A G(w).$$</p>

<p>This yields the recurrence</p>

<p>$$G_{k+1} = \frac{1}{k+1} 
\sum_{m=0}^k  G_{k-m} \sum_{p=c_1}^{c_2} (-1)^m A_1^{(m+1)p}
+ \frac{1}{k+1} A G_k.$$</p>

<p>The base case  here is $G_0 = 1$  and it is important to  note that we
must remove superfluous  terms at every step of  the recursion, namely
those where  $A_1$ is present  with degree more  than $r$ or  $A_2$ to
$A_n$  are  present with  degree  more  than  one.   This is  done  by
restricting  to   the  initial  segment  of   the  appropriate  Taylor
series. We clearly require a CAS to represent the intermediate results
as syntax trees rather than flat lists of coefficients on multivariate
polynomials.  This was  the code.  (We  also verified  that this  will
produce the answers from the companion post when $r=1.$)</p>

<p><strong>Addendum.</strong> There is another possible interpretation of this problem
namely  that  we have  multisets  of  multisets  rather than  sets  of
multisets.   This is  very similar  to the  first version  and may  be
solved quite easily.  PET yields the closed form</p>

<p>$$[A_1^r A_2 \cdots A_n] 
Z(S_k)\left(\sum_{p=a}^b [z^p] 
\sum_{q=0}^r z^q A_1^q \prod_{j=2}^n (1+z A_j) \right).$$</p>

<p>where  $Z(S_k)$  is  the  cycle  index of  the  symmetric  group.  The
derivation using the exponential formula goes through as before and we
obtain</p>

<p>$$G(w) = \prod_{p=c_1}^{c_2}\frac{1}{1-wA_1^p} \times
\exp\left(w A \right).$$</p>

<p>Differentiating to obtain the recurrence now yields</p>

<p>$$(k+1) G_{k+1} = 
[w^k]  \sum_{p=c_1}^{c_2} \frac{A_1^p}{1-wA_1^p} G(w)
+ [w^k] A G(w).$$</p>

<p>and we find</p>

<p>$$G_{k+1} = \frac{1}{k+1} 
\sum_{m=0}^k  G_{k-m} \sum_{p=c_1}^{c_2} A_1^{(m+1)p}
+ \frac{1}{k+1} A G_k.$$</p>

<p>The Maple source  goes like this (code refers to  the previous listing
for common routines). Note that  the distinction between multisets and
sets only becomes active when $r\ge 2.$</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Remark.</strong> As observed by OP in a personal communication we can get a
simple closed form if the restriction on the multisets having at least
$a$  and  at most  $b$  elements  is  lifted. With  $p_k(n)$  counting
partitions and  $c_k(n)$ counting weak  compositons we get  from first
principles  on classifying  by  the  number $m$  of  instances of  the
element with multiplicity $r$ that are in a set by themselves</p>

<p>$$\sum_{m=0}^{r} \sum_{m_1=0}^{k-1} p_{m_1}(m)
{n-1\brace k-m_1} c_{k-m_1}(r-m).$$</p>

<p>Here we use the convention that $p_0(0) = 1.$
Now the number of weak compositions is given by</p>

<p>$$c_k(n) = [z^n] \prod_{m=1}^k \frac{1}{1-z}
= [z^n] \frac{1}{(1-z)^k} = {n+k-1\choose k-1}$$</p>

<p>and we obtain</p>

<p>$$\sum_{m=0}^{r} \sum_{m_1=0}^{k-1} p_{m_1}(m)
{n-1\brace k-m_1} {k+r-m-m_1-1\choose k-m_1-1}.$$</p>

<p>This formula  gives an  idea of  the difficulties  that arise  when we
restrict the  size of the  sets to be  from the interval  $[a,b].$ The
Maple code is  as follows (we checked for Stirling  numbers when $r=1$
and for  a match of  the data from the  enumeration routine --  PET --
when $r\ge 2.$)</p>

<pre>

    m=0..r);
</pre>

<p><strong>Completed answer.</strong> We can actually give a closed from
even for $[a,b]$ not being set to the simple $[1,n].$
Introduce</p>

<p>$$p_{k, a, b}(n) = 
[z^n] Z(S_k)\left(\sum_{q=a}^b z^q\right)
= [z^n] [w^k] \prod_{q=a}^b \frac{1}{1-wz^q}.$$</p>

<p>so this  counts the number  of partitions  into values from  the range
$[a,b]$  using  PET.  Furthermore   introduce  the  marked  generating
function</p>

<p>$$F_{k, b}(z) =
\frac{1}{k!} \left(\sum_{q=1}^b B_q \frac{z^q}{q!}\right)^k.$$</p>

<p>Let the evaluation rule $B_q^*$ be given by</p>

<p>$$B_q = [[a\le q\le b]] \times (1+w+w^2+\cdots+w^{b-q})
\\ + [[1\le q\lt a]] \times (w^{a-q}+\cdots+w^{b-q})
\\ = w^{\max(a-q, 0)}+\cdots+w^{b-q}.$$</p>

<p>This yields the closed form</p>

<p>$${\large (n-1)! \sum_{m=0}^{r} \sum_{m_1=0}^{k-1} p_{m_1,a,b}(m)
[z^{n-1}] [w^{r-m}] \left. F_{k-m_1, b}(z)

"2386860","2386954","<p>Here are some heuristics. As Hans Engler defines, let $k(n)$ be the number of pairs $(a,b)$ with $a&lt;b$ for which $a+b=n$ and $a^2+b^2$ is prime. In other words,
$$
k(n) = \#\{ 1\le a &lt; \tfrac n2 \colon a^2 + (n-a)^2 = 2a^2 - 2an + n^2 \text{ is prime} \}.
$$
Ignoring issues of uniformity in $n$, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateman%E2%80%93Horn_conjecture"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bateman–Horn conjecture</a> predicts that the number of prime values of an irreducible polynomial $f(a)$ up to $x$ is asymptotic to
$$
\frac x{\log x} \prod_p \bigg( 1-\frac1p \bigg)^{-1} \bigg( 1-\frac{\sigma(p)}p \bigg),
$$
where $\log$ denotes the natural logarithm and
$$
\sigma(p) = \#\{ 1\le t\le p\colon f(t) \equiv 0 \pmod p \}.
$$</p>

<p>We now calculate $\sigma(p)$ for $f(a) = 2a^2 - 2an + n^2$.
Note that the discriminant of $f$ is $(-2n)^2 - 4\cdot2n^2 = -4n^2$. Therefore if $p$ does not divide $-4n^2$, the number of solutions is given by the Legendre symbol
$$
\sigma(p) = 1 + \bigg (\frac{-4n^2}p\bigg) = 1 + \bigg (\frac{-1}p\bigg) = \begin{cases}
2, &amp;\text{if } p\equiv1\pmod 4, \\
0, &amp;\text{if } p\equiv3\pmod 4.
\end{cases}
$$
Furthermore, we can check by hand that if $p=2$ then $\sigma(p)=0$, while if $p$ divides $n$ then $\sigma(p)=1$. Therefore our prediction becomes
$$
k(n) \approx \frac{n/2}{\log(n/2)} \cdot 2 \prod_{\substack{p\equiv1\pmod 4 \\ p\nmid n}} \frac{p-2}{p-1} \prod_{\substack{p\equiv3\pmod 4 \\ p\nmid n}} \frac p{p-1}.
$$
(We're abusing notation: those two products don't individually converge, but their product converges when the primes are taken in their natural order.)
In principle that constant could be cleverly evaluated to several decimal places. But for the purposes of experiment, perhaps it's valuable to note that $k(n)$ should be approximately $n/\log n$, times some universal constant, times
$$
\prod_{\substack{p\equiv1\pmod 4 \\ p\mid n}} \frac{p-1} {p-2}\prod_{\substack{p\equiv3\pmod 4 \\ p\mid n}} \frac {p-1}p;
$$
and so the data can be normalized by that function of $n$ to test for consistency.</p>

<p>Let's perform Gauss's algorithm on the simpler example $\, f = x^3 + y^3.\, $ Since $\,(3,0) &gt; (0,3)\,$ the highest degree monomial is $\ 1\cdot x^\color{#0a0}3y^\color{#c00}0,\, $ so we subtract $\ 1\cdot s_1^{\color{#0a0}3-\color{#c00}0} s_2^\color{#c00}0\, =\, (x+y)^3 $ yielding </p>

<p>$$\ x^3+y^3\ -\ (x+y)^3\, =\ {-}3x^2 y - 3x y^2$$</p>

<p>By $(2,1)&gt;(1,2),\, $ RHS has high term $\,-3x^{\color{#0a0}2} y^\color{#c00}1$ so we subtract $\, {-}3 s_1^{\color{#0a0}2-\color{#c00}1} s_2^\color{#c00}1 =\, -3(x\!+\!y)(xy)$</p>

<p>$$\ x^3+y^3\, -\ (x+y)^3\, +\ 3(x+y)(xy) \ =\ 0$$</p>

<p>So the algorithm terminates, yielding $\ f = s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2.\ $ </p>

<p>Exactly the same <em>algorithm</em> works for polynomials in any number of variables: for the high term $\,c\, x_1^{\large a_1}\cdots x_k^{\large a_k}\,$ we subtract $\,c\, s_1 ^{\large a_1-a_2} s_2^{\large a_2-a_3}\cdots s_{k-1}^{\large a_{k-1}-a_k}s_k^{\large a_k},\,$ e.g. in your trivariate example, for high term $\,c\, x^a y^b z^c\, $ we subtract $\,c\, s_1^{a-b} s_2^{b-c} s_3^c.\,$ This reduces such problems to rote <em>mechanical</em> computation, i.e. no guesswork is required to solve such problems, only simple polynomial arithmetic. The algorithm yields a constructive interpretation of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_symmetric_polynomial#The_fundamental_theorem_of_symmetric_polynomials"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials,</a> that every symmetric polynomial has a unique representation as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials.</p>

<p>Gauss's algorithm may be viewed as a special case of Gröbner basis methods (which may be viewed both as a multivariate generalization of the (Euclidean) polynomial division algorithm, as well as a nonlinear generalization of Gaussian elimination for linear systems of equation).

"2386906","2386919","<p>Note that any ordering on $G$ induces an ordering on $G\otimes\mathbb{Q}$, by saying $x/n&lt;y/m$ for $n,m\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ iff $mx&lt;ny$.  Conversely, any ordering on $G\otimes\mathbb{Q}$ induces an ordering on $G$ by restriction, and the original order on $G\otimes\mathbb{Q}$ can be recovered from the order on $G$ as above.  So the set of orderings on $G$ is in bijection with the set of orderings on $G\otimes\mathbb{Q}$.</p>

<p>So we may assume $G$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space.  Now the answer is easy.  If $G$ has dimension $0$ there is only one possible order, and if $G$ has dimension $1$ there are only two possible orders (the usual order on $\mathbb{Q}$ and its reverse).  If $G\cong\mathbb{Q}^2$, it has infinitely many possible orders: for any $q\in\mathbb{Q}$, take the lexicographic order with respect to the basis $(1,0)$ and $(q,1)$.  Explicitly, $(a,b)$ is positive in these orders iff either $a&gt;qb$ or $a=qb$ and $b&gt;0$ (this makes it clear the orders are distinct).  Finally, if $G$ has dimension greater than $2$, choose a two-dimensional subspace $V$ and a complement $W$ so that $G=V\oplus W$.  There are infinitely many orders on $V$, and combining them lexicographically with any order on $W$, we get infinitely many orders on $G$.</p>

<p>Thus a $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space has infinitely many orders iff it has dimension greater than $1$.  It follows that a torsion-free group has infinitely many orders iff it has rank greater than $1$.</p>

"2386967","2386975","<p>You are mapping from a $5$ element set to a $5$ element set.</p>

<p>1) Since we must have $\varphi(-8)=-5$, we need to assign $4$ elements of the domain. In order to make $\varphi$ one-to-one, each of these $4$ elements must map to a unique element of the codomain.

"2386968","2387056","<p>Very generally, if $(X,\mu)$ is a measure space, and $f:X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is measurable and satisfies $\int_{X} |f(x)|d\mu = 0$, then $f = 0$ almost everywhere.</p>

<p>To see why, note that:</p>

<p>$$\{x \mid f(x) \neq 0\} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{x \mid |f(x)| &gt; 1/n\}$$</p>

<p>Letting $A_n = \{x \mid |f(x)| &gt; 1/n\}$, we know $|f| &gt; \frac{1}{n}1_{A_n}$, where $1_{A_n}$ is the function which is $1$ on $A_n$ and $0$ elsewhere hence $0 = \int_X |f| d\mu \geq \int_X \frac{1}{n}1_{A_n}d\mu = \frac{1}{n}\mu(A_n)$. We get $\mu(A_n) = 0$, and therefore $\{x \mid f(x) \neq 0\}$ is the countable union of measure-zero sets and so has measure zero.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Now, any positive function on $[a,b]$ which is Riemann integrable is also Lebesgue integrable, and the integrals agree. But you can prove this without needing measure theory and just using the definition of Riemann integrability on $[a,b]$ (though this proof is very similar to the above):</p>

<p>Assuming $f$ is Riemann integrable and $\int_a^b |f(x)|\, dx = 0$, given any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ we can find a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ such that the upper sum $U(|f|,P) &lt; \varepsilon$. Then for any real number $\delta &gt; 0$, consider just the intervals $I$ in $P$ such that $\sup_{x \in I}|f(x)| \geq \delta$. If the total length of these intervals is $L$, these intervals contribute at least $L\delta$ to the sum $U(|f|,P)$, hence we have $L &lt; \varepsilon/\delta$.</p>

<p>Now fix $\varepsilon_0$, and pick $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_02^{-n}/n$ and $\delta = 1/n$, and the above paragraph shows that we can cover all points where $|f(x)| \geq 1/n$ by intervals whose total length $L$ is $&lt; \varepsilon_02^{-n}$. Then taking the union of all these intervals over $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we get intervals covering the entire set $\{x \mid |f(x)| &gt; 0\}$ whose total length is $&lt; \varepsilon_0$. Since $\varepsilon_0$ was arbitrary, this completes the proof that this set has measure zero.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>As a last comment, I'll just say that the continuity assumption actually makes this proof way easier, and there's no need for fancy measure theory: If $f(x_0) \neq 0$ then by continuity there is some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\delta &gt; 0$ such that $|f(x)| \geq \varepsilon$ for $|x - x_0| \leq \delta$, and so you have $\int_a^{b}|f(x)|\, dx \geq \varepsilon \delta$</p>

"2387084","2387105","<p>The problem is that in order to remedy the problems and paradoxes of naive set theory, the mathematicians around the turn of the century realised that you can't let just any collection be a set. You have to have a list of axioms defining specific sets and set operations, and declare that any collection you can reach in a finite number of steps using the axioms is deemed a set, and nothing more. The axiom of choice lets you access some sets you can't with only the others, specifically functions fulfilling certain properties.</p>

<p>Note that for $N=1,2,3,$ $\cos Nx$ is injective on $[0,1].$ This follows because $\cos x$ is injective on $[0,\pi],$ and for these values of $N,$ $x\to Nx$ maps $[0,1]$ injectively into $[0,\pi].$</p>

"2387117","2387167","<p>No, this need not be the case. For instance, it is possible that with probability $1$, there exists $j$ such that $Z_j=M$ and $Z_k=0$ for all $k\neq j$.

<p>EDIT: As we have discussed in the comments, it <em>is</em> true that $Z_j\to0$ in $L^p$ for any $1\le p&lt;\infty$.

"
"2387158","2387689","<p>The two notions you outlined are equivalent. I'll outline the proof and leave the details to you, don't hesitate to ask if anything is unclear.</p>

<p>Let's suppose that al vector spaces are over a field $\mathbb{K}$. Let $A$ be an algebra, if you want you may assume that it's a Clifford algebra, but that's inessential. For simplicity of notation I will omit the subscript $\mathbb{K}$ from the tensor products.</p>

<p>First let's elucidate what an $A$-module structure on $V$ is. As in your statement, it is first of all a <em>linear</em> map
\begin{equation}
 \Psi:A \otimes V \rightarrow V,
\end{equation}
with the property that $\Psi(e \otimes v) = v$. Second, note that there is a natural map
\begin{equation}
 \mu:A \otimes A \otimes V \rightarrow A \otimes V,
\end{equation}
given by the extension of the map
\begin{equation}
 (a,a',v) \mapsto (aa',v).
\end{equation}
If we want an $A$-module structure on $V$ we now demand that the following holds
\begin{equation}
 \Psi \circ \mu = \Psi \circ (1 \otimes \Psi).
\end{equation}
Let's call this condition (<strong>I</strong>).
This condition might seem complicated, but it's basically point (ii) in your description.</p>

<hr>

<p>If the pair $(V, \Phi)$ is a representation of $A$ in the sense of wikipedia, then one obtains a map
\begin{equation}
 A \otimes V \rightarrow V,
\end{equation}
by the universal property of the tensor product, since the map $A \times V \rightarrow V, (a,v) \mapsto \Phi(a) v$ is $\mathbb{K}$-bilinear.$^{1}$ One may check that the map obtained in this way satisfies condition (<strong>I</strong>), (you will need (ii)). So a representation in the sense of wikipedia implies a representation in the sense of <a href=""http://www.math.harvard.edu/~ecp/latex/misc/haynes-notes/haynes-notes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Haynes</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>In the other direction, if one has a representation in the sense of Haynes, that is a map $\Psi: A \otimes V \rightarrow V$ that satisfies property (<strong>I</strong>), then one obtains a representation in the sense of wikipedia by simply composing $\Psi$ with the natural map $A \times V \rightarrow A \otimes V$.</p>

<p>(1) This is a bit stronger than what you quoted from wikipedia, I'm not sure what article you found on wikipedia, but the condition that I wrote down is definitely the right one.</p>

"2387160","2387225","<p>This answer tries to shine some operator-theoretic light on the issue. I do make two key assumptions which can probably be verified by reading the text your are referencing.</p>

<p>Let's consider the operator $(1+a_1B+a_2B^2)$ if we (or Maurice) assume that there exist solutions $\mu_1,\mu_2$ to $a_2=\mu_1 \mu_2$ and $a_1 = -\mu_1 - \mu_2$, then we can write $$(1+a_1B+a_2B^2)=(1-\mu_1B)(1-\mu_2B).$$</p>

<p>If furthermore $\|\mu_i B\| &lt; 1$ (this is an operator norm), then we get that $(I-\mu_i B)$ is an invertible operator and that $(I-\mu_i B)^{-1}=\sum_{k=1}^\infty (\mu_i B)^k$ This is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumann_series"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Neumann series</a>, a generalization of the geometric series for operators. Writing this as a fraction is kind of a sloppy notation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolvent_formalism#Resolvent_identity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">first resolvent identity</a> provides us with $(I-\mu_1 B)^{-1}(I-\mu_2 B)^{-1} = \frac{1}{\mu_1 - \mu_2}(\mu_1(1-\mu_1B)^{-1} - \mu_2(1-\mu_2B)^{-1}).$</p>

<p>To put it all together: If the $\mu_i$s exist and $\|\mu_i B\| &lt; 1$ then $(I-\mu_iB)$ is invertible and we get from </p>

<p>$(1+a_1B+a_2B^2)X_t= (1-\mu_1B)(1-\mu_2B)X_t = \epsilon_t$  that</p>

<p>$$X_t = (I-\mu_1 B)^{-1}(I-\mu_2 B)^{-1}\epsilon_t = \frac{1}{\mu_1 - \mu_2}(\mu_1(1-\mu_1B)^{-1} - \mu_2(1-\mu_2B)^{-1})\epsilon_t =  \frac{1}{\mu_1-\mu_2}[\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}(\mu_1^{s+1}-\mu_2^{s+1})B^s]\epsilon_t.$$</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I cannot provide proof for why $\|\mu_i B\| &lt; 1$ (or equivalently $\frac{1}{\mu_i}\in \rho(B)$) since this depends on the choice/properties of your $a_i$s and is likely related to the stability mentioned in the other answer.</p>

$$\epsilon^{2}\partial^{2}_{t}\partial_{x}^{2}\delta{\phi}(x, t)-\partial_{t}^{2}\delta{n}(x, t)-\partial_{t}^{2}\delta\phi(x, t)=0$$
From the first equation it then follows
$$\epsilon^{2}\partial^{2}_{t}\partial_{x}^{2}\delta{\phi}(x, t)+\partial_{t}\partial_{x}\delta{u}(x, t)-\partial_{t}^{2}\delta\phi(x, t)=0$$
And from the second one
$$\epsilon^{2}\partial^{2}_{t}\partial_{x}^{2}\delta{\phi}(x, t)+\partial_{x}^{2}\delta{\phi}(x, t)-\partial_{t}^{2}\delta\phi(x, t)=0$$
So
$$(1+\epsilon^{2}\partial_{x}^{2})\partial_{t}^{2}\delta\phi(x, t)-\partial_{x}^{2}\delta{\phi}(x, t)=0$$
The equation is colse to the one you've stated, however the signs do not match and there is an extra $\epsilon^{2}$ factor. Are you sure that there are no mistakes in the original system of equations you've stated?</p>

"2387236","2387468","<p>Given an arbitrary set $S$, the goal is to prove that $S$ is not an element of itself. The proposed proof proceeds by considering the set $T=\{S\}$, i.e., the set $T$ whose one and only member is the set $S$. Then $T$ is nonempty, because it has a member, namely $S$. So we can apply the axiom of regularity to conclude that $T$ has a member that has no members in common with $T$.  That member of $T$ is $S$, because $S$ is the only member of $T$. So $S$ has no members in common with $T$. Tbat is, no member of $T$ can also be a member of $S$. Well, $S$ is a member of $T$, so $S$ cannot be a member of $S$, q.e.d.</p>

"2387238","2387252","<p>A simple solution would be to generate two unit vectors in the plane of the tilted circle. Since you already have the normal $\vec{u}=(u_x,u_y,u_z)$ you could use for instance $\vec{v} = (-u_y,u_x,0)$ and the other $\vec{w}=\vec{u} \times \vec{v} = (-u_x u_z,-u_y u_z,u_x^2+u_y^2)$ and normalise them.</p>

<p>Adding the comment of Robert Israel. In the case that numerical issues would arise caused by $u_x,u_y$ being close to zero you can take a $\vec{v}=(u_z,0,-u_x)$ or $(0,u_z,-u_y)$ as an alternative.

"2387248","2389180","<p>For 5.10:</p>

<p>Suppose that $f=gh$ in $R[X]$, then in $\bar{R}[X]$ this becomes $\bar{a}\bar{\phi}^m=\bar{g}\bar{h}$. Then, since $\bar{\phi}$ is prime, we see that $\bar{g}=\bar{c}\bar\phi^l$ and $\bar{h}=\bar{c'}\bar{\phi}^k$ with $k+l=m$ and $\bar{c}\bar{c'}=\bar{a}$. We can suppose that $cc'=a$ and write $g=c\phi^l+\pi q$ and $h=c'\phi^k+\pi q'$ for some $q,q'\in R[X]$.</p>

<p>Now we have $$f\equiv a\phi^m+\pi(c\phi^lq'+c'\phi^kq)\bmod \pi^2,$$ so $$ \bar{\psi}=\overline{\left(\frac{f-a\phi^m}{\pi}\right)}=\bar{c}\bar{\phi}^l\bar{q'}+\bar{c'}\bar{\phi}^k\bar{q}.$$ Passing to $\bar{R}[X]/(\bar{\phi})$, the hypothesis for $\bar{\psi}$ shows that $l$ or $k$ is $0$, meaning that, say, $\bar{g}$ is constant. But since $a$ is prime with $\pi$, the dominant coefficient of $g$ is prime with $\pi$, so $\deg g=\deg\bar{g}$. Therefore, $g$ is constant and must be a unit in $R$ since otherwise $f$ couldn't be primitive.  </p>

<p>If $g\in Z[X]$ has its all complex roots of absolute value strictly less than 1, then their product has absolute value strictly less than $1$ also.

For each $n\ge 1$ we will provide inductively an example of a sequence $S^{(n)}$ with $length(S^{(n)})=2^{n}$, such that

<p>for $n=4$ we have $S^{(4)}=(1,5,3,5,2,5,3,5,1,5,3,5,2,5,3,5)$.</p>

<p>The inductive construction is the following:</p>

<p>We set 
$$
S^{(n)}_{2k}:=F_{n+1}\quad\text{and}\quad S^{(n)}_{2k-1}:=S^{(n-1)}_{k}\quad\text{for $k=1,\dots, 2^{n-1}$}.
$$</p>

<p>Now we prove inductively that $(S^{(n)}_1,\dots,S^{(n)}_{2^n-1})$ is a solid sequence.</p>

<p>For this we prove a little more:</p>

<p>(1.) For each $S=S^{(n)}$ and any two consecutive sets $A,B\subset S^{(n)}$, if $\#A&gt;\#B$, then $\sum_{i\in A}S_i&gt; \sum_{i\in B}S_i$.</p>

<p>(2.) For each $S=S^{(n)}$ and any two consecutive sets $A,B\subset S^{(n)}$, if $\#A=\#B+1$, then $\sum_{i\in A}S_i- \sum_{i\in B}S_i&lt;F_{n+2}$.</p>

<p>(4.) For each $S=S^{(n)}$ and any two consecutive sets $A,B\subset S^{(n)}$, if $\#A=\#B$, then $\sum_{i\in A}S_i\ne \sum_{i\in B}S_i$, except when 
$\#A=\#B=2^{n-1}$ (and so $A\cup B=S^{(n)}$). </p>

<p>Here we consider at the same time the two cases in which $A$ lies above $B$ and viceversa.</p>

<p>If $\#A=\#B =2k$, then (3.) and (4.) are clear form the inductive hypothesis, since both sets have the same number of $F_{n+1}$'s. Once you remove them, 
by inductive hypothesis the sums satisfy the required conditions (one has to be careful with the case $A\cup B= S^{(n)}$).</p>

<p>If $\#A=\#B =2k-1$, then one of them has one term more with value $F_{n+1}$, and the other has one term more of $S^{(n-1)}$.

which proves (3.) and (4.) in this case.
In fact, the equality is clear, and the last inequality follows from the inductive hypothesis item (1.), since $\#A_{n-1}&lt;\#B_{n-1}$. The first inequality follows from the inductive hypothesis item (2.), since $\#B_{n-1}=\#A_{n-1}+1$, and so

and there are two cases:</p>

<p>a) $\#A_{n-1}&gt;\# B_{n-1}$ and $\#\{F_{n+1}\ \text{ in }A\}$ is greater than or equal to $\#\{F_{n+1}\ \text{ in }B\}$. In this case clearly 
$\sum_{i\in A_{n-1}}S^{(n-1)}_i-\sum_{i\in B_{n-1}}S^{(n-1)}_i&gt;0$ by inductive hypothesis item (1.) and so item (1.) for $n$ follows directly.</p>

<p>b) $\#A_{n-1}=\# B_{n-1}$ and $\#\{F_{n+1}\ \text{ in }A\}$ is greater than $\#\{F_{n+1}\ \text{ in }B\}$. In this case, if 
$\sum_{i\in A_{n-1}}S^{(n-1)}_i-\sum_{i\in B_{n-1}}S^{(n-1)}_i&gt;0$, then item (1.) for $n$ follows directly.
Else $0&lt;\sum_{i\in B_{n-1}}S^{(n-1)}_i-\sum_{i\in A_{n-1}}S^{(n-1)}_i&lt;F_n$ by inductive hypothesis item (3.), and so

$$
and there are two cases:</p>

<p>a) $\#A_{n-1}&gt;\# B_{n-1}$ and $\#\{F_{n+1}\ \text{ in }A\}$ is equal to $\#\{F_{n+1}\ \text{ in }B\}$. In this case clearly 
$\sum_{i\in A_{n-1}}S^{(n-1)}_i-\sum_{i\in B_{n-1}}S^{(n-1)}_i&lt;F_{n+1}&lt;F_{n+2}$ by inductive hypothesis item (2.) and so item (2.) for $n$ follows directly.</p>

<p>b) $\#A_{n-1}=\# B_{n-1}$ and $\#\{F_{n+1}\ \text{ in }A\}$ is $\#\{F_{n+1}\ \text{ in }B\}$ plus one. In this case, 
by inductive hypothesis item (3.) we have 
$$
\sum_{i\in A_{n-1}}S^{(n-1)}_i-\sum_{i\in B_{n-1}}S^{(n-1)}_i&lt; F_n
$$
and so 
$$
\sum_{i\in A}S_i-\sum_{i\in B}S_i = F_{n+1}+\left( \sum_{i\in A_{n-1}}S^{(n-1)}_i-\sum_{i\in B_{n-1}}S^{(n-1)}_i\right)&lt;F_{n+1}+F_n=F_{n+2},

"2387377","2390043","<p>Consider:$$f:\mathbb{R}^2\supset X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2,~z=(x,y)\mapsto \zeta=(\xi, \eta)=f(x,y)$$
Let it be $\mathbb{R}$-differentiable.</p>

<p>If you displace a point $z$ from a $z_0$ the linear part of the change in the value of $f$ (what is called the differential of $f$ at $z_0$) goes from zero vector to a vector that is $\mathbb{R}$-linearly related to $z-z_0$, that is $$df_{z_0}(\Delta z) = D_{z_0}\Delta z\tag{1}$$ where $\Delta z=z-z_0$, $D_{z_0}$ is a $\mathbb{R}$-linear operator.</p>

<p>(You can skip this but remember that the differential of $f$ is defined in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and not simply in $X$ as is $f$. The differential is a linear map and among other things its domain must be a linear space and not a subset. Indeed its independent variable usually indicated with $dz$ is a <em>displacement</em> of the independent variable of $f$ and it can be taken greater as you want even if the resultant displaced $z$ goes outside of $X$: that's why some highlights this fact by calling it <em>virtual displacement</em>. When the virtual displacement is such that $z$ remains in $X$ then the <em>real</em> diplacement $\Delta z$ exists and $\Delta z=dz$)</p>

<p><strong>$\mathbb{R}$-conclusion.</strong>
You can easily see in the $\zeta$-plane where $df_{z_0}(\Delta z)$ is sent when $\Delta z$ is $\mathbb{R}$-linearly related to $\Delta z'$ and $\Delta z''$, that is $\Delta z=a\Delta z'+b\Delta z''$ with $a,~b\in\mathbb{R}$, knowing $df_{z_0}(\Delta z')$ and $df_{z_0}(\Delta z'')$ for every $\Delta z'$ and $\Delta z''$, because for $\mathbb{R}$-linearity it must be that $df_{z_0}(a\Delta z' +b\Delta z'') = a\cdot df_{z_0}(\Delta z')+b\cdot df_{z_0}(\Delta z'')$.</p>

<p>Now let $f$ be $\mathbb{C}$-differentiable.</p>

<p>What I've said above before ""$\mathbb{R}$-conclusion"" remains unaltered with the exception of the occurrences of the expression $\mathbb{R}$-linear (included all grammatical variations) that must be substituted for by $\mathbb{C}$-linear.</p>

<p>Now from $(1)$ above, due to the fact each $\mathbb{C}$-linear operator on $\mathbb{C}$-monodimensional spaces is characterized completely by the multiplication by a complex scalar and so by two real parameters: a relative length variation and angular displacement applied to each and every vector, it follows that the vector $df_{z_0}(\Delta z)$ has a relative length variation and angular displacement with respect to $\Delta z$ that are independent from $\Delta z$! (while this was not the case when only $\mathbb{R}$-differentiability was involved).</p>

<p><strong>$\mathbb{C}$-conclusion.</strong>
You can easily see in the $\zeta$-plane where $df_{z_0}(\Delta z)$ is sent when $\Delta z$ is $\mathbb{C}$-linearly related to $\Delta z'$, that is $\Delta z = a\Delta z'$ with $a\in\mathbb{C}$, knowing $df_{z_0}(\Delta z')$ for every $\Delta z'$, because for $\mathbb{C}$-linearity it must be that $df_{z_0}(a\Delta z') = a\cdot df_{z_0}(\Delta z')$.</p>

<p>(That is, if $\Delta z$ has a length $k$ times that of $\Delta z'$ and an angle of $\theta$ w.r.t. $\Delta z'$ then $df_{z_0}(\Delta z)$ will have a length $k$ times that of $df_{z_0}(\Delta z')$ and an angle of $\theta$ w.r.t. $df_{z_0}(\Delta z')$. That's the meaning of $\mathbb{C}$-linearity in $\mathbb{C}$-dimension $1$, that is, $\mathbb{C}$-proportionality)</p>

<p>But in general you cannot see using the same strategy where $df_{z_0}(\Delta z)$ is sent knowing $df_{z_0}(\Delta z')$ and knowing that $\Delta z$ and $\Delta z'$ are only $\mathbb{R}$-linearly related, that is $\Delta z = h(\Delta z')$, where $h$ is an $\mathbb{R}$-linear operator on $\mathbb{C}$. Indeed, this operator is completely determined when it is known what values it takes on two $\mathbb{R}$-linearly independent vectors. Let's say that it is know, for instance, what the values taken on the vectors $1$ and $i$ are (but we can choose other values). Now let's $\mathbb{R}$-decompose $\Delta z'$ w.r.t. $1$ and $i$: $\Delta z'=\frac{\Delta z'+\overline{\Delta z'}}{2}+\frac{\Delta z'-\overline{\Delta z'}}{2} =\frac{\Delta z'+\overline{\Delta z'}}{2}+i\frac{\Delta z'-\overline{\Delta z'}}{2i}$. For this to be a $\mathbb{R}$-decomposition w.r.t. to $1$ and $i$, the coefficients of $1$ and $i$ must be real, and they are if $\overline{\Delta z'}$ is the complex conjugate of $\Delta z'$. Then it follows straighforwardly that $$h(\Delta z') = h(1)\frac{\Delta z'+\overline{\Delta z'}}{2} + h(i)\frac{\Delta z'-\overline{\Delta z'}}{2i} = \frac{h(1)-i\cdot h(i)}{2} \Delta z' + \frac{h(1)+i\cdot h(i)}{2}\overline{\Delta z'}$$</p>

<p>Concluding, it is:</p>

<p>$$df_{z_0}(\Delta z) = df_{z_0}(h(\Delta z')) = \frac{h(1)-i\cdot h(i)}{2} df_{z_0}(\Delta z') + \frac{h(1)+i\cdot h(i)}{2}df_{z_0}(\overline{\Delta z'})$$ that means that knowing a given $\mathbb{R}$-linear relation between $\Delta z$ and $\Delta z'$ you cannot determine the value of $df_{z_0}(\Delta z)$ from just $df_{z_0}(\Delta z')$: you need $df_{z_0}(\overline{\Delta z')}$ as well when $\frac{h(1)+i\cdot h(i)}{2}\ne0$, so in this case $df_{z_0}$ is not $\mathbb{R}$-linear (although it is $\mathbb{C}$-linear).
<strong>End of the $\mathbb{C}$-conclusion.</strong></p>

<p>As you have seen, differences between $\mathbb{R}$- and $\mathbb{C}$-differentiability are to be searched for in the algebraic part of the process not the analytical and recognizing the special character of the $\mathbb{C}$-differentiability from the fact that composition of a $\mathbb{C}$-linear operator (the differential) with a $\mathbb{R}$-linear operator is only a $\mathbb{R}$-linear operator.</p>

which is $f(w^3)\geq0,$ where $f$ is a decreasing function.</p>

<p>Thus, it's enough to prove our inequality for a maximal value of $w^3$.</p>

<p>Now, $x$, $y$ and $z$ are positive roots of the following equation.
$$(X-x)(X-y)(X-z)=0$$ or
$$X^3-3uX^2+3v^2X-w^3=0$$ or

<p>which happens for equality case of two variables (when $z=y=u-\sqrt{u^2-v^2}$ in our case).</p>

<p>Since our inequality is homogeneous, we can assume $y=z=1$ and we need to prove that

Now, by C-S we obtain
$$\sqrt{x^2+2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt3}\sqrt{(1+2)(x^2+2)}\geq\frac{x+2}{\sqrt3}$$ and
$$\sqrt{2x+1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt3}\sqrt{(2+1)(2x+1)}\geq\frac{2\sqrt{x}+1}{\sqrt3}.$$
Also, by AM-GM
$$3x\leq x^3+2.$$
Thus, it's enough to prove that
$$(x+2)^2(x+2\sqrt{x}+3)\geq9\sqrt[3]{x(x^3+2)^2}$$ or
$$(a^2+2)^2(a^2+2a+3)\geq9\sqrt[3]{a^2(a^6+2)^2},\tag1$$

<p>The last inequality follows from the following inequalities.
$$(a^2+2)^5\geq54a(a^6+2)$$ and
$$2(a^2+2)(a^2+2a+3)^3\geq27a(a^6+2).$$

"
"2387433","2387457","<p>You need to understand what definition of a ""relationship"" is and what it means.</p>

<p>Let's get colloquial.</p>

<p>We can say something simple like ""$a$ and $b$ are related if $b$ is two times $a$"".  So $7$ and $14$ are related and $46$ and $92$ are related but $8$ and $15$ are not related and so on.  Also $14$ and $7$ are not related because the relationship is only one way.  The second number must be twice the first but not vice versa.</p>

<p>So how do we express the idea mathematically?  Not just how to express the idea that <em>one</em> set of $b = 2a$ but the idea of the <em>relationship</em>?</p>

<p>Well, sets.  $X \times Y$ is the set of all pairs $(x,y)$.  So we want all the pairs $(x,y)$ in $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ where $x$ is related to $y$.</p>

<p>In this case we want $R\subset \mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ where $R = \{(a,b)| b = 2*a\}$.</p>

<p>In other words $R$ is the set of all pairs of integers, where the integers are related in a certain way.  In math a ""RELATION"" is a set of ordered pairs where the pair have a certain condition.</p>

<p>In this case the relation is that $R = \{(a,b)| (a,b) \not \in \{(n,n)\}\}$ which can be written as $R = \mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z \setminus \{(n,n)|n \in \mathbb Z\}$.</p>

"2387459","2391743","<p>""How to interpret it as a function of two variables?"" you asked.</p>

<p>Well indeed it is already a function of two (real) variables or one complex variable.
When it comes to differentiability a function of two real variables (or one complex variable, that is the same thing) can be analyzed under two kinds of differentiabilities: $\mathbb{R}$-differentiability and $\mathbb{C}$-differentiability.</p>

<p>A function of two real variables $f: \mathbb{R}^2\supseteq A\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2, z \mapsto f(z)$ is $\mathbb{R}$-differentiable at a given point $z_0=(x_0,y_0)$ when its displacement at that point ($\Delta f_{z_0}: A-z_0\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2,\Delta z\mapsto f(z)-f(z_0)$) under a general displacement of the independent variables $z-z_0$ (usually indicated by $\Delta z$) has main component that is a $\mathbb{R}$-linear operator on $\mathbb{R}^2$ (restricted to a subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ made up of those $\Delta z$'s that send $z_0$ in a point of the domain $A$ of the function $f$, that is, $A-z_0$):</p>

<p>$$f(z)=f(z_0)+D_{z_0}\Delta z+o(\lvert\Delta z\rvert)\tag{1}$$</p>

<p>This main component (extended by $\mathbb{R}$-linearity to the whole $\mathbb{R}^2$, that is, the said $\mathbb{R}$-linear operator) is called $\mathbb{R}$-differential of the function $f$ at $z_0$: $df_{z_0}: \mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2, dz\mapsto D_{z_0}dz$, where $dz$ is its independent variable usually indicated in that way and named <em>virtual</em> (in the sense that it is not always admissible for $(1)$ to have sense) <em>displacement</em> to distinguish it from $\Delta z$, the ""admissible"" displacement.</p>

<p>This is a $\mathbb{R}$-linear operator on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and so for its complete determination at most two of its values are needed (in the sense that if it is non-singular two values are needed, else less). If we are given its values at $dz=(1,0)$ and $dz=(0,1)$, let's say $a=df_{z_0}(1,0)$ and $b=df_{z_0}(0,1)$, then we can rewrite $(1)$ as<br>
$$f(z)=f(z_0)+a\Delta x+b\Delta y+o(\lvert\Delta z\rvert)\tag{2}$$</p>

<p>where $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ are the $\mathbb{R}$-linear components of $\Delta z$ w.r.t. the chosen vectors $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ respectively.
Notice that we can choose equivalently other vectors $\mathbb{R}$-linearly independent.</p>

<p>What's important to remember before turning our attention to the $\mathbb{C}$-differentiability is that in $\mathbb{R}$-differentiability no restrictions have been made about the kind of linear operator.</p>

<p>The definition of $\mathbb{C}$-differentiability of $f$ is the same as that of its $\mathbb{R}$-differentiability with the exception that where you read $\mathbb{R}$-linear it must be now read $\mathbb{C}$-linear. If you do what I say, you'll notice that this happens only at ""$\mathbb{R}$-linear operator on $\mathbb{R}^2$"" that now becomes ""$\mathbb{C}$-linear operator on $\mathbb{R}^2$"". This means that equation $(1)$ is valid, with $D_{z_0}$ being now a $\mathbb{C}$-linear operator.</p>

<p>The $\mathbb{C}$-linear operators on $\mathbb{R}^2$ are the operators ""multiplication of a vector by a complex scalar"" and nothing more: this is because $\mathbb{R}^2$ over $\mathbb{C}$ as a vector space is monodimensional, so there cannot be more $\mathbb{C}$-linear operators on it as there are $\mathbb{C}$-scalars. Each of them is characterized uniquely by a complex scalar and so by two real parameters: the relative increment of the length and the oriented angular displacement of the transformed vector w.r.t. to the vector on which they are applied. Notice that this parameters do not depend on the ""argument"".</p>

<p>You can also check that they are also $\mathbb{R}$-linear as operators on $\mathbb{R}^2$. This means that we can use also equation $(2)$ that was derived by $(1)$ with the assumpion that $D_{z_0}$ were $\mathbb{R}$-linear, because as said $\mathbb{C}$-linearity is a special $\mathbb{R}$-linearity. The purpose is to see what constraints are to be imposed on the chosen values (the vectors $a$ and $b$) of the $\mathbb{R}$-differential to make it a $\mathbb{C}$-differential, that is when it is imposed that the differential must be $\mathbb{C}$-linear instead of $\mathbb{R}$-linear. Then let's try to go from $(2)$ to $(1)$, where $D_{z_0}$ is $\mathbb{C}$-linear.
$$f(z)=f(z_0)+a\Delta x+b\Delta y+o(\lvert\Delta z\rvert)=f(z_0)+a\Delta x+\frac{b}{i}i\Delta y+o(\lvert\Delta z\rvert)=f(z_0)+D_{z_0}\Delta z+o(\lvert\Delta z\rvert)$$</p>

<p>Being $\Delta x+i\Delta y=\Delta z$, it results that must be:
$$\frac{b}{i}=a\tag{3}$$</p>

<p>that is, $b$ must be at $\pi$ radians from $a$ (and $D_{z_0}=a$). This equation is known as Cauchy-Riemann equation.</p>

<p>On the contrary, you can proceed from the other direction. If you know that $D_{z_0}$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-linear operator on $\mathbb{R}^2$ (that is, a complex number) it is a $\mathbb{R}$-linear operator on $\mathbb{R}^2$ that takes each vector to a vector whose length has a relative increment of $A$ and whose angular position has been displaced by $\theta$, where $A$ and $\theta$ characterize completely the $\mathbb{C}$-linear operator, that is $a=A(\cos\theta+i \sin\theta)$ being the transformation of $1$ and $b=A(-\sin\theta+i \cos\theta)$ being the transformation of $i$. So $b$ is displaced by $\pi$ radians from $a$, $a=b/i$. Putting this into $(2)$, you get $(1)$.</p>

The original statement may be quite different from the modern version (often much less general, and lacking a lot of the framework of ideas and terminology that only later grew up around it), and the original proof may be much more complicated than modern proofs.

"2387505","2387511","<p>The number of pairs $p(n)$ is $n(n-1)/2$. This is because from $n$ instances you can select the first instance in $n$ ways and then there is $n-1$ instances left from which you can select the second instance in $n-1$ ways. Then you divide by two because it doesn't matter in which order you select the first and second instance.</p>

<p>You see that this coincide with your recursive formula:</p>

"2387611","2387648","<p>In the complex numbers, no.  $|z|$ is defined to be $\sqrt{z*\overline z}$ which is non negative as $z\overline z = \Re(z)^2 + \Im(z)^2$ is always non-negative real.</p>

<p>I suspect you are asking as we <em>extended</em> the reals to the complex (depending upon your philsophy) by allowing square roots of negatives which as a consequence allowed for logarithms of negative numbers, you are asking if we can create another number system that will allow $|z| &lt; 0$.</p>

<p>It's hard for me to imagine how or why we would do so.  There are no numbers that ""want to exist but can't"" because if they existed there modulus would have to be negative.  And as modulus was defined to be non-neg real, it's hard to imagine in what sense we'd define another meaning for it that satisfy any condition associated with it.  Primarily the condition that the modulus represents the quantitative measure of the absolute non-negative size of something.</p>

<p>=====</p>

<p>Okay, more.</p>

<p>In the reals $|x|$ is defined as $|x| = x$ if $x \ge 0$ and $|x| = -x$ if $x &lt; 0$.</p>

<p>In extending to the complex numbers we could have kept that definition as close as possible by saying $|a+ib| = a+ib$ if $a \ge 0$ and $|a+ib| = -a-ib$ if $a &lt; 0$.  Admittedly we wouldn't ever have $|z| &lt; 0$ but we would have $|z| \not \ge 0$.  We could define, god knows why we'd want to but we could, $|a+ib| = a+b$ and the we could have $|z| &lt; 0$.</p>

<p>So we don't we?  Why instead to we replace the simple $|x| = \pm x$ with the scary looking $|a+bi| = \sqrt{(a+bi)(a-bi)} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$?</p>

<p>Well,  <em>BECAUSE</em> $|a+bi|=  \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ <strong>IS</strong> greater than or equal to $0$.  That $|z| \ge 0$ is a <em>requirement</em> of the definition of anything that we wish to call a ""modulus"".</p>

<p>Y2H in his/her answer lists some of the requirements for what something we call a ""modulus"" must obey.  Why must we obey it to call it a modulus?  Because if we didn't there wouldn't be any meaning to the word ""modulus"".</p>

<p>(Why is an elephant large, gray and wrinkly?  Because if it were small, white and smooth it would be an aspirin.)</p>

<p>The very first requirement is ... that the ""modulus"" is real, and non-negative.</p>

<p>The modulus is essentially the ""size"" of a number.  And size is positive value (or zero if and only if the number is zero).  That's just.... axiomatic.</p>

<p>There are other conditions.  By <em>definition</em>:</p>

<p>In an algebra, If $a,b \in F$, a field, $|a|$ is called the modulus, we must have:</p>

<p>i)$|a| \in \mathbb R; |a| \ge 0$.</p>

<p>ii) $|a| = 0$ if and only if $a$ is the multiplicative identity of $F$.</p>

<p>iii) $|ab| = |a||b|$</p>

<p>iv) $|a+b| \le |a| + |b|$</p>

<p>In vector spaces, $|x|$ is a norm and we must have (by definition) where $V,W$ are  vectors in a vector space and $a$ is an element of a field:</p>

<p>i) $|V| \ge 0; |V| \in \mathbb R$</p>

<p>ii) $|V| = 0 \iff V = 0$</p>

<p>iii) $|aV| = |a||V|$ where $|a|$ is a modulus of $a$.</p>

"2387680","2387737","<p>It might be easier to just use the explicit description of limits and co-limits. It is a general result in universal algebra in any category of generalized algebras (e.g. rings or groups) that the limit of a diagram $I$ is the subset of the product of the objects of $I$ satisfying the functional equations of the arrows of $I$. Similarly, the co-limit of $I$ is the quotient of the co-product of the objects of $I$, the equivalence relations are given by relations generated by the arrows of $I$.</p>

<p>Apply it to the case of rings and groups. The product (resp. coproduct) of rings is direct product (resp. tensor product), and the product (resp. co-product) of groups is the direct product (resp. free product). However, since the underlying group of  a ring is abelian, for your case free product of the groups in the image of the additive functor is the direct sum.

And to convince yourself that $F(s)-e^{s^2}F(0)=0$ stays true for every $s \in \mathbb{C}$, because both sides are complex analytic functions of $s$ (a non-zero power series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n s^n$ cannot vanish for every $s\in \mathbb{R}$).</p>

<p>Here's a slightly quicker way:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the smallest positive integer $b_1$ such that $17b_1 \equiv 1 \pmod{13}$. That would be 10.</li>
<li>Find the smallest positive integer $b_2$ such that $13b_2 \equiv 1 \pmod{17}$. This one is easier to find: 4.</li>
<li>Compute $13 \times 17 = 221$.</li>
<li>Next compute $(11 \times 17b_1) + (9 \times 13b_2) = 1870 + 468 = 2338$.</li>
<li>Now, starting with the number from the previous step, repeatedly subtract the number from Step 3 and stop short of a negative number: 2117, 1896, ..., 128. That's your answer. Verify it.</li>

<p>Actually, any of the numbers you got from Step 5 will work. In fact, given any integer $n$ whatsoever, we have $2338 + 221n \equiv 11 \pmod{13} \equiv 9 \pmod{17}$ (don't get confused about your directions with negative $n$, though).</p>

<p>This method should work as long as the two moduli are coprime, as 13 and 17 certainly are. This method can also be adapted for three, four moduli, however many more, as long as all the moduli are pairwise coprime.</p>

They are called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonelementary_problem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nonelementary</a>. The Ackermann function grows too fast, an according to <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/27120/ackermann-function-time-complexity"">this</a> answer there are natural problems with Ackermannian complexity.</li>
<li>Arbitrary: For most sensible functions $F$, it's possible to have an algorithm with complexity $F(n)$, that gets a Turing machine and simulates it for $F(n)$ steps. For example, you can obtain an algorithm with complexity $n^{5+(-1)^n}$. You can also define (artificially) a problem that can be solved in this time.</li>
<li>Ill-defined: Blum's speedup theorem shows that there exists a computable function $f$ such that, if $f$ can be computed in time $X$, then $f$ can computed in time $\log X$. There is no ""best"" algorithm to compute $f$. It's not ""natural"" because it's a diagonalization against possible algorithms, but shows how weird this can get.</li>

<p>I'll just write $\Pi$ for the product of countably many copies of $\mathbb{Z}$.</p>

<p>By <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/320444/why-isnt-an-infinite-direct-product-of-copies-of-bbb-z-a-free-module"">a theorem of Baer</a>, $\Pi$ is not a free abelian group, but if it were, then $\text{Ext}^1(\Pi,\mathbb{Z})$ would be zero. So you can expect any proof to be at least as hard as Baer's theorem.</p>

<p>One proof of Baer's theorem uses a famous <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/831845/how-can-one-show-that-rm-hom-bigl-prod-limits-i-geqslant-1-bbb-z-bbb-z"">result of Specker</a> that describes $\text{Hom}(\Pi,\mathbb{Z})$, and in particular shows that it is countable. This can be used to prove your statement.</p>

<p>Although $\text{Hom}(\Pi,\mathbb{Z})$ is countable, $\text{Hom}(\Pi,\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})$ is uncountable (in fact, of cardinality $2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$), since $\Pi/2\Pi$ is a vector space of infinite dimension over the field $\mathbb{F}_2$ of two elements, and so has uncountably many homomorphisms to $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.</p>

$$\text{Hom}(\Pi,\mathbb{Z})\to\text{Hom}(\Pi,\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})\to\text{Ext}^1(\Pi,\mathbb{Z}).$$
Since the first term is countable, but the second term is uncountable, the third term is non-zero.</p>

"2387828","2387847","<p>Yes, your original description is basically correct. You can describe the polynomial ring over $R$ having indeterminates $x_1,\ldots ,x_n$ as formal linear combinations of monomials with coefficients from the ring $R$.</p>

</ol>

<p>A defining feature of polynomial rings is that the <em>lack</em> extra relations like $x_1=x_2^2$. Of course, it is very useful to study such rings, and they are studied <em>as quotients of polynomial rings</em>, but the concept of the big thing that is totally free of any relations is the important thing to establish as a creature of its own.

It follows that $N \subseteq \ker(f)$ and since $\ker(f)$ has index $2$ in $F$, it follows that we actually have $N = \ker(f)$ (as the index of $N$ was at most $2$).

"
"2387997","2388017","<p>Let's make some definitions more clear before we move on to the intuition, so that we can be sure we are talking about the same things. In this context, a <em>path</em> is some possibly curved line between two endpoints. A <em>parameterization</em> of a path are the formulas $x = x(t)$ and $y = y(t)$. You can think of a path as some geometric object and a parameterization as some equations describing the path. The key here is that a path can have several parameterizations; for example, the straight line from $(0, 0)$ to $(1, 1)$ can be parameterized as $x = t, y = t$ or $x=t^2, y=t^2$, for $t \in [0, 1]$.</p>

<p>Now what about line integrals? A line integral is an integral over a <em>path</em>; ordinarily we compute a line integral using a parameterization of a path, but the original line integral won't make mention to a specific parameterization of said path. This is because <em>any parameterization of a path will yield the same line integral</em>. You can try this out with any line integral you will come across right now by using different parameterizations. Indeed, some parameterizations will be easier to calculate the integral than others.</p>

<p>Let's contrast this with what your question is asking. There are some line integrals where <em>only the endpoints</em> of the path of integration actually matter; the path itself can be anything, so long as the endpoints are as specified. This is much different than have different parameterizations (we have whole different paths!). These line integral for which the path of integration ""doesn't matter"" are called conservative, and I'm sure you will cover these types of fields in your course.</p>

<p>As a classic example, think of gravity (say, at the surface of the earth). We know an object falls from point $A$ to point $B$, and the question is how much work gravity has done to this object. Since gravity is a constant unidirectional force, you can convince yourself that no matter what meandering path is taken, gravity will do the same amount of work. For example, if the object goes up, the object must come back down, and so that initial negative work done by gravity is counteracted by the positive work when the object comes back down. Alternatively, if you have taken a physics course, you know that we can calculate the work done by gravity in this example using <em>potential</em> energy. This concept of a potential function is critical to conservative fields.</p>

<p>As a classic non-example, take friction. The longer and more winding the path you take, the more frictive forces act on the object, and the more work is done. Thus path matters here when calculating work (but again, parameterization does not).</p>

<p>Now if $n$ is not a cube of a rational number, the polynomial $x^3 - n$ does not have any rational roots, so it is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ (since any factorization would involve a factor of degree one). Thus $\left[ \mathbb{Q} \big[ \sqrt[3]{n} \big] : \mathbb{Q} \right] = 3$, so $(\ast)$ may not hold. Hence $n$ is a cube of a rational number.</p>

<p>Now $\sqrt{n} = m - \sqrt[3]{n}$ is rational, so $n$ is also a square of a rational number, therefore $n = a^6$ for some $a \in \mathbb{Q}$. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> since my solution involves some field theory the reader may be unfamiliar with, I will introduce the necessary part below.</p>

<p>Let $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ stand for the set of all polynomials with rational coeffiecients. </p>

<p><strong>Claim.</strong> Let $n \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $\alpha = \sqrt[3]{n}$. Suppose the polynomial $p(x) = x^3 - n$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, that is, whenever $p(x) \equiv u(x) \cdot v(x)$ for some $u(x), v(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, either $u(x)$ or $v(x)$ is constant. Then there is no nonzero polynomial $q(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ of degree at most $2$ such that $q(\alpha) = 0$.</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose that $q(\alpha) = 0$ fo some nonzero polynomial $q(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ of degree at most $2$. By polynomial division we find $u(x), r(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $r(x) \equiv 0$ or $\deg r(x) &lt; 2$ and</p>

<p>$$p(x) \equiv u(x) \cdot q(x) + r(x).$$</p>

<p>Substituting $x = \alpha$, we get</p>

<p>$$0 = u(\alpha) \cdot 0 + r(\alpha),$$</p>

<p>i.e. $r(\alpha) = 0$. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If $r(x) \equiv 0$, we get a contradiction, because $p(x) \equiv u(x) \cdot q(x)$ is a factorization of $p(x)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with non-constant factors.</p></li>
<li><p>If $\deg r(x) = 0$ so $r(x)$ is constant nonzero, this is an immediate contradiction.</p></li>
<li><p>If $\deg r(x) = 1$, then $r(\alpha) = 0$ implies $\alpha \in \mathbb{Q}$ so $p(x)$ may be reduced by the factor $x-\alpha$, which is a contradiction.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So the claim is proved. $\blacksquare$</p>

<p>Now it suffices to note that $(\ast)$ may be written in form $q(\alpha) = 0$, where </p>

"2388066","2388138","<p>Your first step (in the comment) is right, and I assume that, when you wrote ""$x^2\ln a$ is equal to $0$,"" you meant that its third derivative is $0$, which is also true. So now you need to differentiate $x^2\ln x$ three times. By the product rule, the first derivative is $2x\ln x+x$. Two more differentiations will annihilate the $x$ term, so you just need to differentiate $2x\ln x$ twice more. A second differentiation, again using the product rule, gives you $2\ln x+2$, and finally a third differentiation gives $2/x$. The problem says to evaluate this at $x=4$, so you get $1/2$.</p>

"2388099","2388135","<p>The answer depends on what exactly your definition of a commutative ring is: whether it's required to have a multiplicative identity $1$ or not.</p>

<p>If $R$ does have a multiplicative identity $1$, then $1 = a + b$ for some $a \in I, b \in J$.  Then $1 = (a + b)^3 = (a + 3b) \cdot a^2 + (3a + b) \cdot b^2 \in I^2 + J^2$, so $I^2 + J^2$ is the entire ring.</p>

<p>If the definition of (commutative) ring you're using does not require a multiplicative identity $1$, then consider the subring of $\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$ generated by $x$ and $y$.  This is the subring of polynomials with a zero constant term.  Let $I := \langle x \rangle$ and $J := \langle y \rangle$.  Then $I^2 + J^2 = \langle x^2, y^2 \rangle$ is the ideal of polynomials such that the $x$, $y$, $xy$ coefficients are all zero.  In particular, $x \notin I^2 + J^2$, so $I^2 + J^2$ is not all of $R$.</p>

"2388100","2388196","<p>As pointed out in the comments, the usual way to solve an inhomogeneous solution is to use the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Green's function</a> for the differential operator, which depends on the region in which the differential equation is to be solved.</p>

<p>If the region has spherical symmetry, however, one can just look for a particular solution that has the same symmetry: i.e. a function of $r$. One then solves the equation
$$ \nabla^2 v(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} (r^2v')' = c, $$
which has particular solution $v(r)=r^2/6$.</p>

<p>In either case, the homogeneous solution is then included to make the equation satisfy the boundary conditions, as one would with an ordinary differential equation.

"2388127","2388180","<p>In elementary school, it's hard for kids to ""switch between notation"", as we have done later on in our lives.</p>

<p>We start with $\div$, then we go to $/$, and now we do something like $\frac{a}{b}$.</p>

<p>In elementary, students are not familiar with ""fractions"", or just know the very basics about them. Hence the $\frac{a}{b}$ ratio doesn't make sense ... not until you actually use fractions in middle school and so on.</p>

<p>It's important to realise that $'/'$ the slash, <strong>refers to fraction</strong>. When we write $(a/b)$, it's because we are lazy and do not want to write $\frac{a}{b}$. So technically it's the same thing as fraction.</p>

<p>This is why students in elementary just use the regular $\div$ symbol. It's just a symbol. No fractions or anything complicated just yet. It's the same reason why kids in elementary use $\times$ to indicate multiplication and not the dot, $\cdot$, as we use when we are older. They do not deal with complex numbers, and so these symbols that we use as adults are really after we see the use of math. In elementary, it's very basic, hence basic symbols.</p>

<p>In the end it's because of the type of math we do. Imagine writing something like this:</p>

<p>$$\int^{\dfrac{x}{5}}_{0}(x^3+\frac{x^2}{2}+\ln(\sin(\frac{x}{4})))dx$$</p>

<p>$$\int^{x\div 5}_{0}(x^3+(x^2 \div 5)+\ln(\sin(x\div 4)))dx$$</p>

"2388134","2388195","<p>Suppose that the series $a_k^2$ is divergent, put $S_n=\sum_1^n a_k²$. Then $S_n \to +\infty$; hence we may suppose that $S_n&gt;0$ for $n\geq 1$. Put $b_n=\frac{a_n}{S_n }$. Then as
$$b_n^2=\frac{S_{n}-S_{n-1}}{S_n^2}\leq \int_{S_{n-1}}^{S_n}\frac{dt}{t^2}$$ we see that the series $b_n^2$ is convergent. The hypothesis gives now that the series $u_n=\frac{a_n^2}{S_n}=\frac{S_n-S_{n-1}}{S_n}$ is convergent. Hence $u_n\to 0$, and $\frac{S_{n-1}}{S_n}\to 1$. This imply that $u_n$ is equivalent to $v_n=\frac{S_n-S_{n-1}}{S_{n-1}}$, and hence (the two series are positive) the series $v_n$ is convergent. But
$$v_n=\frac{S_n-S_{n-1}}{S_{n-1}}\geq \int_{S_{n-1}}^{S_n}\frac{dt}{t}$$

"2388179","2393014","<p>The second part of your proof is incorrect.
Convexity is not a pointwise property, but a property of the function on a specific set (its domain in most cases). So, saying ""it is also convex for $t=0$"" is inaccurate. </p>

<p>I would simply use definition of convexity to prove this part:</p>

<p>($\Leftarrow$) Let us take $x_1,x_2\in\text{dom}f$. We need to show that for every $\alpha\in[0,1]$
\begin{equation}
\alpha f(x_1)+(1-\alpha)f(x_2)\geq f(\alpha x_1+(1-\alpha)x_2).
\end{equation}
Now, since $g(t)=f(x+vt)$ is convex for all $x\in\text{dom}f$ and all $v$, for every $\alpha\in[0,1]$:
\begin{align}
\alpha g(t_1)+(1-\alpha)g(t_2)&amp;\geq g(\alpha t_1+(1-\alpha)t_2) \\
\alpha f(x+vt_1)+(1-\alpha)f(x+vt_2)&amp;\geq f(x+v(\alpha t_1+(1-\alpha)t_2))
\end{align}
let us take $x=x_1$, $v=x_2-x_1$, $t_1=0$ and $t_2=1$, and assign them to the last inequality:
\begin{equation}
\alpha f(x_1)+(1-\alpha)f(x_2)\geq f(\alpha x_1+(1-\alpha)x_2)
\end{equation}
and therefore $f$ is convex.</p>

"2388185","2388192","<p>Let $H$ be the event that heads appears, $T$ the event that the two-headed coin is drawn, $F$ the event that the fair coin is drawn, and $W$ the event that the weighted coin is drawn.</p>

<p>For part (a), we just need to compute $P(H)$. Since $T$, $F$, and $W$ partition the sample space (i.e., they are pairwise disjoint and their union accounts for all possibilities), we can use the law of total probability to get
$$
P(H) = P(H \mid T)P(T) + P(H\mid F)P(F) + P(H\mid W)P(W) = (1)(1/3) + (1/2)(1/3) + (1/3)(1/3) = 33/54.
$$</p>

<p>Now, for part (b), we use Bayes' theorem to compute
$$
P(T \mid H) = \frac{P(H\mid T)P(T)}{P(H)} = \frac{(1)(1/3)}{(33/54)}=6/11.
$$</p>

<hr>

<p>To better understand what is going on with Bayes' theorem, I find it useful to derive the formula above by using the definition of conditional probability:
$$
P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}.
$$
This definition shows that $P(A\cap B) = P(A\mid B)P(B)$, and so by the symmetry of intersection, $P(A\cap B)=P(B\cap A) = P(B\mid A)P(A)$. This yields the formula
$$
P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}
= \frac{P(B\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}.
$$
Thus, in a way, we sort of ""reverse"" our assumption from $B$ to $A$.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, this is also how the law of total probability is derived. If $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ partition the sample space, then we have
$$
P(A) = P(A\cap X_1) + \cdots + P(A\cap X_n) = P(A\mid X_1)P(X_1)+\cdots +P(A\mid X_n)P(X_n).

"
"2388193","2391360","<p>Your matrix elements for the adjoint are not correct. You are seemingly calculating the matrix elements for $A$ in the basis $(e_i)_i$ which is not orthonormal. Using your scalar product it should then be $w_j^2$ for the adjoint in the $(i,j)$-th place. One has:
$$ \langle A^* e_m , e_k \rangle = \langle e_m,A e_k\rangle = w_m^2 w_k^2 \delta_{m,j}\delta_{k,i}$$</p>

<p>The symmetry becomes perhaps even more apparent if you work in the basis $(u_i)_i$ of unit vectors for your norm. Write:
$$ A = A_{i,j}  = w_i w_j \langle \cdot, u_i \rangle u_j$$
and the adjoint is simply $A^* = A_{j,i}$. Thus $A^* A = w_i^2 w_j^2 
  \langle \cdot, u_i \rangle u_i$ from which you get that the two norms are identical. This is also as one should expect since $A$ has rank 1.</p>

"
"2388203","2389447","<p>I still have not understood your problem completely, so this is only a partial answer. </p>

<p>I believe you are interested in a function $g : I \rightarrow J$, but you do not have an explicit formula for $g$. Here $I$ and $J$ are real intervals. However, it is known that $y = g(x)$ satisfies an equation of the form $$f(x,y) = 0,$$
where $f : I \times J \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. In this situation, you can certainly try to apply Newton's method. It takes the following form
$$ y_{n+1} = y_n - \frac{f(x,y_n)}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y_n)},$$
where the initial value $y_0$ should be close to the target value $y=g(x)$ to ensure convergence. I want to stress, that the derivative is merely the regular partial derivative of $f$ with respect to its second variable and that the chain rule is not involved here.</p>

<p>It is entirely possible that computing this derivative will be quite expensive in your specific case. It may be worthwhile to apply the secant method instead. It converges at a slower rate than Newton's method, but can be substantially faster because it only requires $1$ rather than $2$ function evaluations per iteration. Ideally, you should combine the secant method with bisection in order to obtain a method which is robust.</p>

<p>You mentioned a specific example, that of 
$$h(x,g(x)) = a(x)g(x).$$
I much prefer to write
$$h(x,y) = a(x)y.$$
With this notation all confusion evaporates and we have
$$\frac{\partial h}{\partial y}(x,y) = a(x).$$
The notation you cited is common in physics texts. I object to it precisely because of the confusion it can generate.</p>

<p>EDIT: It seems prudent to mention the related case of 
$$k(x) = h(x,g(x)).$$
Then if $h = h(x,y)$ and $g = g(x)$ are differentiable, we have that $k=k(x)$  is differentiable, with
\begin{align}
k'(x) &amp;= \frac{\partial h}{\partial x}(x,g(x))\cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial x}(x) + \frac{\partial h}{\partial y}(x,g(x))\cdot \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} (x) \\

"
"2388213","2388224","<p>Yes! There are several strategies you can use to attempt to normalize the input before being sent of the a softmax function. This is often a desired behavior due to softmax's asymptotes that quickly rise with even a relatively small input. However, there are no ways where you can truly specify a range short of normalizing the inputs along each layer. What you can do is try to keep them small in proportion to keeping them accurate. This is on of the main battles of correctly fitting a neural network.</p>

<p>There are two main approaches you can take to do this. I believe the prior is much more of what you're looking for.</p>

<h2>1. Input Control</h2>

<p>Controlling input to a network involves two things. Controlling the values of the inputs themselves, and controlling the weights that mutate those inputs. </p>

<h3>a) Normalize Your Input</h3>

<p>You are going to want to use some sort of normalization on your initial input to scale your feature vectors appropriately. A standard approach is to scale the inputs to have mean 0 and a variance of 1. Also linear decorrelation/whitening/pca helps a lot.</p>

<h3>b) Use a regularization term in your loss function.</h3>

<p>When adding a regularization term in your loss function, you can allow back prop to train for keeping the weights of your network small as to control the value going into the activation function. There are two main regularization terms for the kernel (weights).</p>

<p>$l1$ regularization:</p>

<p>$new\_loss\_f = old\_loss\_f + kernel$</p>

<p>and $l2$ regularization:</p>

<p>$new\_loss\_f = old\_loss\_f + \frac{1}{2}kernel^2$</p>

<p>For example, cross entropy loss with l2 regularization becomes:</p>

<p>$$\mathcal{L}(X, Y) = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n y^{(i)} \ln a(x^{(i)}) + \left(1 - y^{(i)}\right) \ln \left(1 - a(x^{(i)})\right) + \frac{1}{2}K^2$$</p>

<p>Thus, your loss function accounts for the size of the kernel, or weights, and punishes them being larger. In optimization (back-prop), the weights will be adjusted accordingly to of course mitigate this additional term.</p>

<h2>2. Batch Normalization</h2>

<p>This is a less common technique, but some choose to use <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""> batch normalization</a> to control the inputs to the hidden layers. This is mostly used to speed up training, but does have theoretical control over the inputs to different hidden layers.</p>

There is indeed a scaling factor between ${\rm d}(s,t)$ and the corresponding area element ${\rm d}S$ on $U$. This scaling factor appears explicitly in your formula, it is $|{\bf r}_s\times{\bf r}_t|$.

"2388248","2388290","<p>Set $G:=M+N$ (which we know is odd). The operation here - on both jugs - is doubling $\bmod G$.  Looking just at the $M$ jug, you either have<br>
$M\to 2M \quad$ or<br>
$\begin{align}
M\to\  &amp;G-2N \\ 
&amp;= G-2(G-M) \\ 
&amp;= 2M-G
\end{align}$</p>

<p>So the cycle length will divide the order of $2\bmod G$ (the smallest value $k$ such that $2^k\equiv 1 \bmod G$), which itself will divide the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmichael_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Carmichael function</a> $\lambda(G)$.</p>

<p>The minimum cycle occurs when $M=2N$ for example $(M,N)=(6,3)$</p>

<p>If $G$ is prime and  $2$ is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_root_modulo_n"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">primitive root</a> $\bmod G$, and assuming the jugs are labelled, you will have a full cycle of all $G{-}1$ possibilities for every starting configuration.</p>

<p>In the case $G=7$, we have that $2$ is not a primitive root, giving cycles of length $3$:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wMRYz.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wMRYz.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>(here the blue squares are valid starting possibilities as defined, again taking the jugs as labelled)</p>

<hr>

<p>For your example $M=104, N=47$, we have $G=151$ which is prime. The order of $2 \bmod 151$ will divide $151{-}1=150$ by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Euler's theorem</a>. We'd need to check the values of $2^i \bmod 151$ to find the cycle length; depending on what tools you have available, it's probably just as easy to run the calculation on $M$.</p>

<p>$104 \to 57 \to 114 \to 77 \to 3 \to 6 \to 12 \to 24 \to 48 \to 96 \to 41 \to 82 \to 13 \to 26 \to 52 \to 104$</p>

<p>So when $M\le 75$ - meaning $M&lt;N$ - the next value is $2M$, otherwise the next value is $2M-151$ as I explained before.</p>

<p>I don't know of any particular shortcut that will give you the minimum values, unless you have a full cycle of $G-1$ (in which case the minimum is $1$).</p>

<hr>

<p>For $G=185$, we have $185=5\times 37,$ then $\lambda(185) = {\rm lcm}( \lambda(37),\lambda(5)) = {\rm lcm}(36,4) = 36$ So we expect a cycle length of (or dividing) $36$ (marked jugs). Also, for initial states with multiples of $37$, we'd expect a cycle length of $4$. </p>

<p>Checking the cycle on $1$, we indeed get a cycle length of $36$ (the second half just being the same as the first but with jug quantities reversed). So there should be $5$ such cycles, since each cycle runs the the full set of congruences $\bmod 37$ (coprime to $37$) and there are $5$ of each such value in the range. And then the $4$-cycle on multiples of $37$ will complete the set, $5\times 36+4=184$.</p>

<p>The minimum value in the cycle will obviously not be a member of any other cycle. Also in the case of $G=185$ you know that $5$ and $37$ will be the smallest member of whichever cycles they are in, since they are prime divisors of $185$ and all quantities in that cycles will be divisible by those starter primes. But in general finding the minimum of every cycle is not quick. I believe it's always prime (or $1$).</p>
"
"2388250","2388409","<p>There are several problems here.</p>

<p>First there is a typographical one: it is silly for you to use the arrows $\color{blue}{\rightarrow}$. What you are asserting is that those functions are <em>equal</em>. So you should be writing $\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^{x^2}f(t)\,dt\color{red}{=}\frac{d}{dx}F(x^2)\color{red}{=}2x\cdot f(x^2)$, etc.</p>

<p>The second error is that the function $x\mapsto \int_a^{x^2}f(t)\,dt$ is not equivalent to the function $x\mapsto\int_a^{x}f(t^2)\,dt$, nor do they differ only by a constant, so it is not clear why you think they ought to have the same derivative.</p>

<p>For example, take $f(t)\equiv 1$, i.e., the function that is equal to $1$ for all values of $t$. Then the value of the first function is $\int_a^{x^2}dt=x^2-a$ while the value of the second function is $\int_a^xdt=x-a$. For this reason, it is wrong to expect that</p>

<p>$$\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^{x^2}f(t)\,dt=\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^{x}f(t^2)\,dt$$</p>

<p>Indeed, in this case, when $f(t)\equiv 1$, we get that the derivative of the first function, with respect to $x$, is the function $x\mapsto 2x$, while the derivative of the second function, with respect to $x$, is the function $x\mapsto 1$.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here is the correct way to do the calculation. Let us set $g(x)=\int_a^{x^2}f(t)\,dt$ and $h(x)=\int_a^{x}f(t^2)\,dt$ and assume that the hypotheses of the FTC are satisfied. </p>

<p>Then indeed $g'(x)=2x\cdot f(x^2)$, using the chain rule.</p>

<p>Moreover, with $f(t^2):=j(t)$, we see $h(x)=\int_a^{x}j(t)\,dt$, so $h'(x)=j(x)=f(x^2)$.</p>

<p><strong>So your final answers, $2x\cdot f(x^2)$ and $f(x^2)$, are indeed correct</strong>; the functions I've called $g$ and $h$ <strong>do</strong> have different derivatives.</p>

<p>Your error is subtle and lies in thinking that both derivatives yield $\frac{d}{dx}F(x^2)$. That is correct for the first calculation, though it would be more precise to write $\frac{d}{dx}(F(x^2)-F(a))$. However, as the user Cauchy says in a comment, the antiderivative of $f(t^2)=j(t)$ is not the same thing as the antiderivative of $f(t)$. The correct statement for the second calculation is $\frac{d}{dx}(J(x)-J(a))$. The FTC says this gives $j(x)=f(x^2)$.</p>

"2388252","2388258","<p>No, it is not uniformly continuous. Let $g(y)=\frac{1-y}{1+y}$ and note that $g(y)=f(1,y,0)$. Therefore, if $f$ was uniformly continuous, then $g$ would be uniformly continuous too. But it isn't. Take $\delta&gt;0$. Since $\lim_{y\to-1^+}g(y)=+\infty$, it is easy to find two numbers $x,y\in(-1,-1+\delta)$ such that $\bigl|g(x)-g(y)\bigr|\geqslant1$. Therefore, if you take $\varepsilon=1$,$$(\forall\delta&gt;0)(\exists x,y\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{-1\}):|x-y|&lt;\delta\wedge\bigl|g(x)-g(y)\bigr|\geqslant\varepsilon.$$This is the negation of the uniform continuity of the function $g$.</p>

"2388268","2388401","<p>So, $N$ is the subset of the partition that contains $1$.</p>

<p>For any $A\in \mathcal P$, we indeed have $A\subseteq AN$ because $1\in N$, but this implies that $AN$ must be a subset of the <em>same</em> element, $A$. <br>
[Say, $AN\subseteq B\in \mathcal P$, then $\emptyset\ne A\subseteq B$, so they intersect, hence $A=B$ must hold by the partition.]</p>

"2388275","2388319","<p>The idea is to show that each coefficient $a_i$ is $0$, starting with $a_0$, and then proceeding to $a_1$, and so on. Since any polynomial has finite degree, this process will have terminated after a finite number of steps, and the claim will be proved.</p>

<p>To show $a_1 = 0$, we do the following: Since $a_0 = 0$, we have that
$$
P(t) = t(a_nt^{n-1}+\dots+a_2t+a_1),
$$
and that $P(t)=0$ for every value of $t$. Let's call $Q(t) = P(t)/t$ whenever $t$ is nonzero. Since $P$ is $0$ for every $t$, $Q$ is necessarily $0$ for every nonzero $t$.</p>

<p>The idea now is to show, by way of contradiction, that $a_1$ is $0$. To accomplish this, the author assumes that $a_1$ is nonzero, and uses this fact to choose some particularly clever value $0&lt;c&lt;1$ such that $|Q(c)| &gt; 0$. This is a contradiction because since $c$ is positive, we must have $Q(c) = 0$.</p>

<p>Assuming you understand the details of the author's proof by contradiction, now you want to show that $a_2$ is $0$. To do this, write
$$
Q(t) = t(a_nt^{n-2} + \dots + a_3t + a_2).
$$
Now, use the same idea we used to show $a_1 = 0$ to show that $a_2 = 0$. Since any polynomial has finite degree, this process of showing that each $a_i = 0$ must terminate after some finite number of steps, and hence we will have shown that $P$ is identically $0$.</p>

<hr>

<p>Since you're having some trouble with the inequalities, I will try to break them down for you, piece by piece. The goal here is to show, first of all, that $a_1 = 0$. Once that's done, we can show that $a_2 = 0$, and so on. </p>

<p>So, suppose that $a_1 \ne 0$. (If it is already $0$, great! We could then show that $a_2$ is $0$, and proceed.) Consider the fraction
$$
F = \frac{|a_1|}{2\,(|a_2| + \dots + |a_n|)}.
$$
Since $a_1\ne 0$, $|a_1|&gt;0$, so $F$ is some positive number. We can, of course, choose another positive number that is less than $F$. We will call this $c$. Thus $c&lt;F$, or, equivalently,
$$
c&lt;\frac{|a_1|}{2\,(|a_2| + \dots + |a_n|)}\iff 2c\,(|a_2| + \dots + |a_n|) &lt; |a_1| \iff c\,(|a_2| + \dots + |a_n|) &lt; \frac{|a_1|}{2}. \tag{1}
$$
Here is a little lemma for you to help with the next inequality we're dealing with: (I won't prove it for you, so consider it an exercise to either prove it or read a proof somewhere.)</p>

<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are any two real numbers, then
$$
|\alpha + \beta| \ge |\alpha| - |\beta|.
$$
Applying our lemma to $|Q(c)| = |a_1 + \big(Q(c)-a_1\big)|$, we have
$$
|a_1 + \big(Q(c)-a_1\big)| \ge |a_1| - |Q(c)-a_1| = |a_1| - |a_nc^{n-1} + \dots + a_2c|.
$$
By the triangle inequality, $|a_nc^{n-1} + \dots + a_2c| \le |a_nc^{n-1}| + \dots + |a_2c|$, and negatives flip the inequality, so we obtain:
$$
|Q(c)| \ge |a_1| - (|a_nc^{n-1}| + \dots + |a_2c|) = |a_1| - (|a_n|c^{n-1} + \dots + |a_2|c).
$$
Now, since $0 &lt; c &lt; 1$, if $k\ge 1$, then $c^k \le c$, so we get the next inequality:
\begin{align*}
|Q(c)| &amp;\ge |a_1| - (|a_n|c^{n-1} + \dots + |a_2|c) \\
&amp;\ge |a_1| - (|a_n|c + \dots + |a_2|c) \\
&amp;= |a_1| - c(|a_n| + \dots + |a_2|).
\end{align*}
Using the last equivalence in (1), we have
$$
|Q(c)| \ge |a_1| - c(|a_n| + \dots + |a_2|) &gt; |a_1| - \frac{|a_1|}{2} = \frac{|a_1|}{2} &gt; 0.
$$
Now what does this mean? Since $|Q(c)|&gt;0$, it follows that $Q(c)$ is either positive or negative, but not $0$, which is a contradiction because $c$ is positive and $Q(c) = 0$, as we said earlier. Thus $a_1$ must be equal to $0$ after all, and you can proceed in the manner I outlined above.</p>

<p>It is a long division in which the dividend and the divisor are ordered by increasing powers. One begins by dividing the lowest degree term of the dividend by the lowest degree term of the divisor, instead of the highest degree terms for Euclidean division. Contrary to the latter, division by increasing powers never stops. It is based on the following general result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given two polynomials $f,g \in K[X]$ $\:(g(0)\ne 0)$, for any $n\ge 0$, there  exists polynomials $q_n, r_n$ such that
  $$f(X)=q_n(X)g(X)+X^n r_n(X)$$

"2388357","2388405","<p>If the aim is parts of equal area, then a solution is to cut a square portion in the middle (length side $l$): this will leave a square donut with a square opening, to be then cut in two.
In order for the parts to have equal area, the following equation should hold (area of central cut square minus hole area, equal to half the resulting square donut with square opening):
$$ l^2 - 2\pi r^2 = \frac {1}{2}(L^2 - l^2)$$ where $r$ is the radius of the round hole, $L$ the side length of your donut, $l$ the side of the square to be cut in the middle (its center coinciding with the hole center).

<p>In practice, one could also pragmatically cut in four pieces along the diagonals, and serve one part each. Then one can divide the remaining in three parts: being smaller, any error will be reduced.
Even better, cut the excess of a inscribed circumference in the original square: you get a classic donut easy to divide in three exactly.

"
"2388413","2388461","<p>Yes.  To be precise, the following is a theorem of ZFC-Infinity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose there exists a set $N$, a function $S:N\to N$, and an element $0\in N$ such that $(N,S,0)$ satisfies the second-order Peano axioms (that is, the list of properties you wrote).  Then the axiom of infinity is true (that is, there exists a set $I$ such that $\emptyset\in I$ and for all $x\in I$, $x\cup\{x\}\in I$).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Note that this statement includes existential quantifiers on $N$, $S$, and $0$ which yours omits, which is necessary in order for it to be expressible as a sentence in the language of set theory.]</p>

<p>It is pretty complicated to write out all the details of the proof, but basically you develop all the usual theory of the natural numbers on the structure $(N,S,0)$ from the second-order Peano axioms to prove it is in bijection with the ordinal $\omega$.  In particular, you prove that you can define functions on $N$ by recursion: given any (class) function $G$ and any $a$, you can define another (class) function $f$ with domain $N$ such that $f(0)=a$ and $f(S(x))=G(f(x))$ for all $x\in N$.</p>

<p>(Proof sketch: define a relation $\leq$ on $N$ by $x\leq y$ iff every subset of $N$ containing $x$ and closed under $S$ also contains $y$.  Now prove by induction on $x$ that there exists a unique function $f_x$ on $\{y\in N:y\leq x\}$ such that $f(0)=a$ and $f(S(y))=G(f(y))$ for all $y&lt;x$.  The union of all these functions $f_x$ is then a function $f$ defined on all of $N$ with the required properties.)</p>

<p>In particular you can define a function $f$ on $N$ such that $f(0)=\emptyset$ and $f(S(x))=x\cup\{x\}$ for all $x$.  By the axiom of replacement, the image of this function $f$ is a set $I$, which then witnesses the axiom of infinity.</p>

"2388419","2388791","<p>As commented by paul garrett, this is not true. You can pick $m = 1$,
then $V = H^1(\Omega)$ is certainly closed in $H^1(\Omega)$, but not in $L^2(\Omega)$.</p>

<p>However, one can proof the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $V \subset H^m(\Omega)$ be bounded, closed and convex. Then $V$ is closed in $L^2(\Omega)$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The proof is rather straightforward: Let $u_n \to u$ in $L^2(\Omega)$ with $u_n \in V$. Then, $\{u_n\}$ is bounded in $H^m(\Omega)$.
Since $H^m(\Omega)$ is a Hilbert space, a subsequence of $u_n$ (not relabeled) converges weakly to some $\tilde u \in H^m(\Omega)$. It is easily checked that $\tilde u = u$. Further, since $V$ is closed and convex, it is weakly closed in $H^m(\Omega)$ and this yields $u = \tilde u \in V$.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to mention that you can neither drop the boundedness (see above) or the convexity:
For example, take $m = 1$, $\Omega = (0,1)$ and
$$V = \{ v \in H_0^1(0,1) : |v'| = 1 \text{ a.e. in } (0,1)\}.$$
Then, $V$ is closed and bounded in $H^1(0,1)$ but not in $L^2(0,1)$. If I am not mistaken, the closure in $L^2(0,1)$ should be precisely the closed convex hull of $V$, e.g.
$$\{v \in H_0^1(0,1) : |v'| \le 1 \text{ a.e. in } (0,1)\}.$$</p>

"
"2388441","2388527","<p>From a purely geometric point of view, I think you're right: there is no such thing as <strong>the</strong> center of a plane. But in a way that means that you can treat <em>any</em> point of the plane as the center (this idea can be useful in certain Physics problems that have a certain symmetry; e.g. computing the electric field across a parallel plane capacitor), and in a way we can select a point to be the center by imposing a coordinate system on the space.</p>

<p>For example, let's consider 2D space for a minute and consider the line defined by $y = 2x$. As a geometric object, this line also has no center. But with our usual coordinate system, we are tempted to view it as ""centered"" about the origin. We could imagine ""shifting"" the line along itself two units up and one unit to the right, and the ""center"" would now be located at the point $(1,2)$.</p>

<p>Geometrically, of course, we haven't changed anything. That's the symmetry of a line. But I think it's enlightening to see what happens to the <em>equation</em> of the line when we think about performing this ""shift"" operation. To shift the graph of some equation involving $x$ and $y$, we subtract the horizontal and vertical shift amounts from the corresponding variables. In this case, $x \to x-1$ and $y \to y-2$. Thus our line <em>equation</em> becomes
$$ y-2 = 2(x-1) $$
which, of course, simplifies into $y = 2x$ upon algebraic manipulation, which corresponds to the geometric symmetry that shifting a line along itself doesn't really change it. Also note that the equation above is the <em>point-slope form</em> of the equation of a line! And for that matter, when we construct an equation for a line using point-slope form, the point we pick could be thought of as the ""center"".</p>

<p>We can even play this game in 3D with your flat plane example of $z = a$, except, let's rewrite this equation in a way that reflects a coordinate system. I can rewrite it as
$$ z-a = 0(x-h) + 0(y-k) $$
which is something like the point-slope form for a line, but ""centered"" at the point $(h,k,a)$ in space. And you see that, no matter what $h$ and $k$ we choose, the equation trivially simplifies into $z=a$, which corresponds to the plane's symmetry.</p>

<p>So if you want to think of it this way, to ""shift"" a plane (or a line, or any other such symmetrical object) doesn't change the plane <em>itself</em>, but it does change the <em>equation</em> of the plane--although it remains algebraically <em>equivalent</em> to the original equation just as, geometrically, a ""shifted"" plane, though it is shifted, looks identical to the original.</p>

square root term has radius of convergence $1/4$ and the rational term
$(k-1)/k^2.$ Furthermore with $k\ge 3$ we have $1/4 \gt (k-1)/k^2.$ We

"2388489","2398422","<p>Theory of linear equations works exactly the same way no matter the field. Let $k$ a field and $A\in M_n(k)$.</p>

"2388491","2391073","<p>Your posed existence criterion boils down to that the pair $(A,B)$ must be controllable. Namely your second description basically requires the same as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hautus_lemma"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hautus lemma</a>.</p>

<p>My answer will be based on an answer of mine to <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2376418"">this related question</a>. This is my own approach onto the problem, so it might not match any known algorithm exactly, but should give a reasonable image of the steps involved in solving this. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.1370.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a> is also a paper going into more detail of how solve the problem in a more robust and numerically stable way. That paper also contains a few references to other algorithms.</p>

<p>For convenience I will just define the full state feedback gain as $K\in\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ (so no need for the transpose). This means that you are interested in finding a $K$ such that </p>

<p>$$
A - B\,K = \hat{A} = V\,\Lambda\,V^{-1}, \tag{1}
$$</p>

<p>with $\Lambda,V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$. The right hand side of $(1)$ is the Jordan decomposition of $\hat{A}$, such that the columns of $V$ contain the generalized eigenvectors of $\hat{A}$ and $\Lambda$ is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_matrix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jordan matrix</a>. In order to find a $K$ such that the eigenvalues of $\hat{A}$ match a given set of eigenvalues, including the information about the geometric multiplicity (so $\Lambda$), then you also have to solve for $V$ at the same time. In order to do this $(1)$ can be rewritten as</p>

<p>$$
A\,V - B\,\Omega = V\,\Lambda, \tag{2}
$$</p>

<p>with $\Omega = K\,V$, which also lies in $\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$. This equation is linear in all unknowns which will make it easier to solve later on. Once $(2)$ is solved for $V$ and $\Omega$, then the full state feedback gain can be found using $K = \Omega\,V^{-1}$. When using the structure of $\Lambda$ it is possible to decouple the dependencies of the columns of $V$ and $\Omega$ to only the columns associated with each Jordan block of $\Lambda$. Namely at the start of each Jordan block you have to solve</p>

<p>$$
A\,V_{\bullet,i} - B\,\Omega_{\bullet,i} = \Lambda_{i,i}\,V_{\bullet,i}, \tag{3}
$$</p>

<p>with $i$ the first index associated with a Jordan block and $X_{\bullet,i}$ denotes the $i$th column of matrix $X$. In order to obtain a nonzero solution an additional constraint has to be added, such as $\|V_{\bullet,i}\| = 1$. Each next equation associated with that Jordan block is</p>

<p>$$
A\,V_{\bullet,i+k} - B\,\Omega_{\bullet,i+k} = V_{\bullet,i+k-1} + \Lambda_{i+k,i+k}\,V_{\bullet,i+k}, \tag{4}
$$</p>

<p>with $k$ from one till the size of the Jordan block. It can be noted that due to the definition of a Jordan matrix then it must be true that $\Lambda_{i+k,i+k} = \Lambda_{i,i}$ for all specified $k$. These equations do not have have a trivial zero solution. However both $(3)$ and $(4)$ can have more unknowns then equations, so some extra constraints or minimization criteria would have to be used. I believe many algorithms differ by choosing different criteria.</p>

<p>It can be noted that the place command of MATLAB also constraints $\Lambda$ to only a Jordan matrix with Jordan blocks all of size one (so exactly diagonal). This implies that it is not possible to assign an eigenvalue with multiplicity greater then the rank of $B$, since the eigenvectors should all be linearly independent of each other, otherwise $V^{-1}$ would not exist. In order to see why this is the case $(3)$ can be rewritten as </p>

<p>$$
(A - \Lambda_{i,i}\,I) V_{\bullet,i} = B\,\Omega_{\bullet,i}. \tag{5}
$$</p>

<p>The right hand side of $(5)$ is just a linear combination of the columns of $B$, so the left hand side should be as well. The number of linearly independent vectors that can be constructed by the right hand side is by definition equal to the rank of $B$. Either $\Lambda_{i,i}$ is not an eigenvalue of $A$, in which case any set of linearly independent $V_{\bullet,i}$ should be transformed by $A - \Lambda_{i,i}\,I$ into another linearly independent set of vectors and vice versa. Or $\Lambda_{i,i}$ is an eigenvalue of $A$, in which case eigenvectors of $A$ corresponding to that eigenvalue will be solutions for $V_{\bullet,i}$ (and $\Omega_{\bullet,i}$ in the null space of $B$). However the number of other solutions will decrease by the same amount because of the properties of the Hautus lemma. So when $A - \Lambda_{i,i}\,I$ loses rank, then any linear combination of its columns also losses the ability to form a column of $B$. Therefore the geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue can never be greater then the rank of $B$. But this also implies that the number of Jordan blocks associated to the same eigenvalue can also never be greater then the rank of $B$. </p>

<p>If $\Lambda_{i,i}$ is not an eigenvalue of $A$ then one way of reducing the decrease of freedom would be to solve $(3)$ and $(4)$ for the eigenvectors for a given $\Omega$ by rewriting them as</p>

<p>$$
V_{\bullet,i} = (A - \Lambda_{i,i}\,I)^{-1} B\,\Omega_{\bullet,i}, \tag{6}
$$</p>

<p>$$
V_{\bullet,i+k} = (A - \Lambda_{i,i}\,I)^{-1} (B\,\Omega_{\bullet,i+k} + V_{\bullet,i+k-1}). \tag{7}
$$</p>

<p>This should yield a solution as long as $\Omega_{\bullet,i}$ does not lie in the null space of $B$ and its columns associated to $(6)$ using the same eigenvalue are linearly independent.</p>

<hr>

<p>For example given the following system</p>

<p>$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
B = \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}. \tag{8}
$$</p>

<p>This system basically are two decoupled double integrators, which is controllable. All eigenvalues should be placed at -1. The rank of $B$ is two, so in order to do this there are three choices for the Jordan block sizes, namely 2 and 2, 3 and 1, or only 4. For the first choice the associated $\Lambda$ is given by</p>

<p>$$
\Lambda = \begin{bmatrix}
-1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1
\end{bmatrix}.
$$</p>

<p>When solving all $(6)$ and $(7)$ it actually does not really matter what is picked for $\Omega$. As long as it gives a nonsingular $V$ then the feedback gain will always be</p>

<p>$$
K = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{bmatrix}.
$$</p>

<p>It can be noted that this is actually also a decoupled controller. For the second choice the associated $\Lambda$ is given by</p>

<p>$$
\Lambda = \begin{bmatrix}
-1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1
\end{bmatrix}.
$$</p>

<p>When solving all $(6)$ and $(7)$ it does matter what is picked for $\Omega$. I wrote some quick program in MATLAB which, after normalizing $V$, tries to minimize $\|V^\top V - I\|_F$ (a measure of how orthogonal the eigenvectors are). Here $\|X\|_F$ denotes the <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FrobeniusNorm.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Frobenius norm</a> of $X$. This does seem to have local minima, because it does not always converge to the same solution. One of the solutions gives the following feedback gain</p>

<p>$$
K = \begin{bmatrix}
-0.3628 &amp; 0.6372 &amp; -0.6724 &amp; -0.6724 \\
 2.7621 &amp; 2.7621 &amp;  2.3628 &amp;  3.3628
\end{bmatrix}.
$$</p>

<p>For the third choice the associated $\Lambda$ is given by</p>

<p>$$
\Lambda = \begin{bmatrix}
-1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1
\end{bmatrix}.
$$</p>

<p>When solving all $(6)$ and $(7)$ it does again matter what is picked for $\Omega$. When using the same optimization criteria as the previous choice for $\Lambda$, then again there seem to be multiple local minima. One of the solutions gives a feedback gain very similar to the gain of from the first choice</p>

<p>$$
K = \begin{bmatrix}
 1.0001 &amp; 2.0000 &amp; 0.0005 &amp; 0.0000 \\
-0.0000 &amp; 0.0000 &amp; 0.9999 &amp; 2.0000

<p>$\frac gg\frac{a}{\frac{f+hce}{g}}-c=q-g$</p>

"2388541","2388692","<p>A normed space has the property (that all metric spaces have) that $X$ is separable then all subsets are separable too in their subspace topology. So $X^\ast$ (norm)-separable implies that $B_{X^\ast}$ is separable. The reverse also holds in all normed spaces $Y$ by ""scaling"": if $x \neq 0$ then choose $\alpha = \frac{1}{\|x_n\|}$ so that $\|\alpha x\| =1$. If we then (by separability of the unit ball) find a sequence $d_n$ on the ball $B_Y$ that converges to $\alpha x$, and also a sequence of rationals $q_n \to \frac{1}{\alpha}$. Then $q_n d_n \to \frac{1}{\alpha} (\alpha x) = x$. This essentially shows that if $D$ is countable and dense in $B_Y$ then $\{qd: q \in \mathbb{Q}, d \in D\}$ is (countable and) dense in $Y$. So $B_Y$ separable iff $Y$ separable. So we lose nothing by using the unit ball (here the sphere really). And the Hahn-Banach theorem which links things in $X$ to $X^\ast$, gives us functionals on $B_{X^\ast}$ anyway.</p>

<p>Using the unit sphere makes things easier, because you know the norm of all dense elements, namely 1, which allows for the choice of the $x_n$ (otherwise we'd need to scale there too which makes for a more messy proof). We have to prove something on $X$, so we can find points $x_n$ on which $f_n$ is relatively large: we know that $\|f_n\| = \sup \{|f_n(x)|: x \in B_X \}$, so we can find $x_n \in B_X$ such that $|f(x_n)|$ is as close to $1$ as we like. Here more than $\frac{1}{2}$ is sufficient.</p>

<p>As above a countable dense set in $B_X$ is enough to get one on $X$, using the span with rational coefficients. So try that for the $D = \{x_n: n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ we now have: taking finite sums from $D$ with rational coefficients we can approximate all members of the linear span of $D$ (just approximate real coefficients in $\mathbb{R}$ by members of $\mathbb{Q}$; we use that the field is separable). This $\operatorname{span}_{\mathbb{Q}}(D)$ is still countable (standard set theory argument: finite products of countable sets are countable and a union of countably many countable sets is countable). So $Y = \overline{\operatorname{span}(D)}$ has a countable dense set $\operatorname{span}_{\mathbb{Q}}(D)$. So we'd be done if $Y =X$. So assume it's not.</p>

<p>Then, Hahn-Banach allows us to find a functional $f$ (back to $B_{X^\ast}$ where we know something about the $f_n$) that has norm $1$ and is $0$ on $Y$. (In particular $f$ is such, that it is $0$ on the set $D$ where the $f_n$ are chosen to be large, and so the $f$ is very ""different"" from the $f_n$ and so we cannot approximate it in norm by the $f_n$.) </p>

<p>So we know $f(x_n) = 0$ (as $x_n \in Y$!) and the final part of the proof shows that if $f_n$ is chosen to be close to $f$, the point $x_n$ where $f_n$ is large shows that $f$ should also be at least $\frac{1}{4}$ in that point as well.
This gives the needed contradiction.</p>

<p>is wrong for several reasons. First, it wasn't clear what $\alpha$ is; I had to read almost to the end to guess that you mean $\alpha := \limsup |a_n|^{1/n}$ (but that's just a writing issue). More importantly, the logic is not correct. The fact that $a_n$ is bounded does not imply this - for example, $a_n = 2^{-n}$ wouldn't have it. You need to also invoke the fact that the series $\sum_n a_n$ diverges.</p>

<p>To fix this: We have $\alpha \le 1$ because the sequence is bounded. If $\alpha &lt; 1$, then root test would imply convergence of $\sum_n a_n$, so by contraposition we find that $\alpha \ge 1$. Hence $\alpha = 1$ and the rest of your proof is fine.</p>

"2388577","2388654","<p>Noah's answer is excellent but makes things a bit more difficult than necessary since he is proving that $F$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$, rather than merely that $F$ is complete (and so he is basically also reproducing the proof that every complete ordered field is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$).  Here is a quick direct proof that if an ordered field $F$ satisfies the intermediate value theorem, then it is Dedekind-complete.</p>

<p>Suppose $X\subset F$ is a nonempty set that is bounded above but has no least upper bound.  Define a function $f:F\to F$ by $f(x)=1$ if $x$ is an upper bound of $X$ and $f(x)=0$ if $x$ is not an upper bound of $X$.  Let $a\in X$ and let $b$ be an upper bound for $X$.  Then $a-1&lt;b$, $f(a-1)=0$ and $f(b)=1$.  But there is no $c$ between $a-1$ and $b$ such that $f(c)=1/2$.  So, assuming $f$ is continuous, this violates the intermediate value theorem for $F$.</p>

<p>It thus remains only to show that $f$ is continuous.  To show this, it suffices to show that for any $x$, there is an open interval $(c,d)$ containing $x$ such that $f(y)=f(x)$ for all $y\in (c,d)$.  First suppose $f(x)=0$.  Then $x$ is not an upper bound for $X$, so there is some $d\in X$ such that $x&lt;d$.  We then have $f(y)=0$ for all $y\in (-\infty,d)$.  Now suppose $f(x)=1$.  Since $x$ is not the least upper bound of $X$, there is some $c&lt;x$ such that $c$ is also an upper bound of $X$.  We then have $f(y)=1$ for all $y\in (c,\infty)$.</p>

Replacing $x$ by $x/n$ and raising to the $n$th power gives $$x^n\,e^{-x}\le n^n\,e^{-n}=C_n$$ for $x&gt;0,$ that's the boundedness.<br>
We have to show only the existence of the improper integral $\int^\infty_1x^n\,e^{-x}\,dx,$ since the existence of $\int^1_0x^n\,e^{-x}\,dx$ is trivial.
But $$\int^b_1x^n\,e^{-x}\,dx=\int^b_1\frac{x^{n+2}\,e^{-x}}{x^2}\,dx\le \int^b_1\frac{C_{n+2}}{x^2}\,dx\le\int^\infty_1\frac{C_{n+2}}{x^2}\,dx=C_{n+2},$$  because $x^{n+2}\,e^{-x}\le C_{n+2},$ as was shown above.

"2388747","2389317","<p>To make things a little bit simpler, let us assume that the centre of the circle corresponds with the origin of the cartesian reference frame. Then the circle is characterised by
$$
\frac{x^2}{R^2} + \frac{y^2}{R^2} = 1
$$
where $R$ is its radius of the circle and since the point $(x_p,y_p)$ lies on the circle we have $R = \sqrt{x_p^2 + y_p^2}$. </p>

<p>Rotating the circle about the line $y=0$ will result in a projected ellipse with a long axis $R$ that is along the $x$-direction and a shortened axis of length $R \cos\theta$ in the $y$-direction. The projected ellipse is therefore characterised by
$$
\frac{x^2}{R^2} + \frac{y^2}{R^2 \cos^2\theta} = 1
$$
This projected ellipse will in general not pass through the point $(x_p,y_p)$ anymore and we therefore make an isotropic expansion of the ellipse by a factor $f\geq1$. This gives for the scaled ellipse the curve 
$$
\frac{x^2}{f^2 R^2} + \frac{y^2}{f^2 R^2 \cos^2\theta} = 1
$$
Since this has to pass again through the point $(x_p,y_p)$ this gives a simple equation
$$
\frac{x_p^2}{f^2 R^2} + \frac{y_p^2}{f^2 R^2 \cos^2\theta} = 1
$$
which we can easily solve for the scaling factor $f$ and find
$$
f^2 = \frac{x_p^2 \cos^2\theta + y_p^2}{R^2 \cos^2 \theta}
$$
which can be inserted back into the characterisation we obtained for the scaled ellipse and gives the final answer
$$
\frac{x^2 \cos^2\theta}{x_p^2 \cos^2\theta + y_p^2} + \frac{y^2}{x_p^2 \cos^2\theta + y_p^2} = 1
$$
The correctness can easily be confirmed by checking that it is an ellipse that passes through the point $(x_p,y_p)$ and of which the ratio of the long and short axis is indeed $\frac{1}{\cos\theta}$. For an arbitrary centre $(x_o,y_o)$ of the circle this would result in
$$
\frac{(x-x_o)^2 \cos^2\theta}{(x_p-x_o)^2 \cos^2\theta + (y_p-y_o)^2} + \frac{(y-y_o)^2}{(x_p-x_o)^2 \cos^2\theta + (y_p-y_o)^2} = 1

"2388757","2388779","<p>This limit holds for any matrix. Any $k \times k$ matrix $A$ cannot have eigenvalues of arbitrary magnitude, so $(n I + A)^{-1}$ is defined for all $n$ in some neighborhood of infinity (and minus infinity). In this neighborhood we can state that

So if we define $f(h) = \left(I + hA\right)^{-1}$, we are interested in the limit $$\lim_{h\to 0} f(h).$$ We have seen that $f$ is indeed defined in a neighborhood around $0$ and since taking inverses is continuous we find that $f$ is continuous and thus

The $r_i$'s are elements of $G$ so they can be written in terms of the generators, i.e. $r_i=a_{i_1}^{\epsilon_1}\cdots a_{i_k}^{\epsilon_k}$ where $\epsilon_j=\pm 1$ for every $i$. </p>

<p>Suppose that there is map $f:\{a_1,\dots,a_n\}\to H$ (<em>$f$ is just a map defined on the generators, not a homomorphism)</em> with the property
$$f(a_{i_1})^{\epsilon_1}\cdots f(a_{i_k})^{\epsilon_k}=1_H$$
<em>Note: If $f$ was a homomorphism that would be just $f(r_i)$, so, what we are assuming is just that $f$ vanishes on each relation of $G$.</em></p>

<p>Then, $f$ can be extended to a homomorphism $\bar{f}:G\to H$ such that $\bar{f}(a_i)=f(a_i)$ for each $i$.</p>

<p>The proof of that is quite obvious, set $\bar{f}(a_i)=f(a_i)\,\forall i$, extend $\bar{f}$ holomorphicaly and voilà.</p>

<p>Now that is important for your answer since it proves why $G:=\langle a,b|a^3,b^2,ab=ba\rangle$ and $C_3\times C_2$ are isomorphic. Write $C_3\times C_2$ as $C_6$ and define $f(a)=2$, $f(b)=3$. Then $f$ vanishes on each relation and by von Dyck's theorem you have a homomorphism $\bar{f}:G\to C_6$ which is surjective, since $2$ and $3$ generate $C_6$. Now define $g:C_6\to G$ by setting $g(1)=b\cdots a^{-1}$. If I am not mistaken, $g\circ f=id_G$ and $f\circ g=id_{C_6}$, so they are indeed isomorphic.</p>

<hr>

<p>I will present a very straightforward proof that avoids all those pesky subscripts. Let $\tilde{B}$ denote the matrix whose columns are the $b_i$. You can reinterpret the second statement in your preliminaries as $$ w = \tilde{B}[w]_B.$$</p>

<p>As a side note: We didn't even need to use the fact that $\tilde{B}$ is invertible. Any linear transformation will map dependencies to dependencies.

"2389052","2389542","<p>You need  to define the function in the complex plane, e.g. through:
$$ f(x) = \exp \left( x \log\left( 1 + \frac{1}{x}\right) \right) .$$
Here, the tricky part is the log for which you need to specify a branch cut.
For example, you may say that $\log(z)$ is defined for $z\in {\Bbb C}\setminus {\Bbb R}_-$, so that $f$ becomes defined for $x\notin [-1,0]$. You may choose other branch cuts but for $f$ you will always get some branch cut between $0$ and $-1$. Now $f(x)$ tends to $e$ as $|x|\rightarrow \infty$ so indeed $f$ does have a Laurent expansion which you may find by expansion of $\log$:
$$ f(x) = \exp ( x \sum_{k\geq 1} \frac{(-1)^{k-1}x^{-k}}{k} ) = 
e \cdot \exp \sum_{p\geq 1} \frac{(-x)^{-p}}{p+1} = e \cdot

"2389054","2389103","<p>Well, with the exercises of this kind, it seems to be worth to have at least an idea of what precisely is happening, otherwise you are lost in nonsensical symbolic manipulations. So what you have is a function $g$ of two independent variables $x$ and $y,$ let's write it like $z = g(x,y).$ You can identify it with its graph actually as a subset in $\mathbb{R}^3.$ What you are interested most is,loosely speaking, whether there is a function, say $h,$ such that if you perform a change of variables
\begin{eqnarray*}
x &amp; = &amp; a(r,\phi,\psi)\\
y &amp; = &amp; b(r,\phi,\psi)\\
z &amp; = &amp; c(r,\phi,\psi),
\end{eqnarray*}
the graph of $g$ transforms into the graph of $h$ parametrized by two of the three coordinates $r,\phi,\psi.$ The theorem on implicit functions (TIF) tells you that this can be done everywhere the Jacobian matrix $\frac{D(a,b,c)}{D(r,\phi,\psi)}$ is nonsingular.</p>

<p>Now if you put $a(r,\phi,\psi) = r \cos{\phi},$ $b(r,\phi,\psi) = r \sin{\phi}$ and $c(r,\phi,\psi) = \psi$ (this is the so called change of independent variables because the dependent variable transforms like identity), you can figure out (directly or by checking the determinant $\frac{D(a,b,c)}{D(\psi, x, y)}$ and using the TIF) that
\begin{eqnarray}
x &amp; = &amp; r \cos{\phi} \\
y &amp; = &amp; r \sin{\phi}\\
g(x,y) &amp; = &amp; h(r,\phi) (= g(r \cos{\phi}, r \sin{\phi}))
\end{eqnarray}
for certain function $h$ of the independent variables $r,\phi$ (it is better to think like there are NO dependent and independent variables and to view the equations above as implicit relationship between $x,y,r,\phi,\psi.$) Now you want the $g_x$ and $g_y$ in terms of $h_r$ and $h_{\phi}.$ Note that
\begin{equation}
g_x = h_r r_x + h_{\phi} \phi_x
\end{equation}
(yes, in general $r$ and $\phi$ also depend on $x$ and $y,$ a consequence of TIF again) and that
\begin{equation}
g_y = h_r r_y + h_{\phi} \phi_y
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Differentiating the first two of the three equations above with respect to $x$ you have
\begin{eqnarray}
1 &amp; = &amp; r_x \cos{\phi} - (r \sin{\phi}) \cdot \phi_x \\
0 &amp; = &amp; r_x \sin{\phi} + (r \cos{\phi}) \cdot \phi_x
\end{eqnarray}
and eliminating you obtain
\begin{equation}
r_x = \cos{\phi}, \quad \phi_x = - \frac{\sin{\phi}}{r},
\end{equation}
so that in fact
\begin{equation}
g_x = h_r \cos{\phi} - \frac{1}{r} h_{\phi} \sin{\phi}.
\end{equation}
Similarly differentiating the same two equations of the three above with respect to $y$ gives
\begin{eqnarray}
0 &amp; = &amp; r_y \cos{\phi} - (r \sin{\phi}) \cdot \phi_y \\
1 &amp; = &amp; r_y \sin{\phi} + (r \cos{\phi}) \cdot \phi_y
\end{eqnarray}
and eliminating you end up with
\begin{equation}
r_y = \sin{\phi}, \quad \phi_y = \frac{\cos{\phi}}{r},
\end{equation}
so that
\begin{equation}
g_y = h_r \sin{\phi} + \frac{1}{r} h_{\phi} \cos{\phi}.

First of all, at an LP endpoint, a boundary condition is neither

<p>However, a viable approach is to try to prove that the spectrum is
discrete as is. A simple method is presented by Titchmarsh [2, Ch. V]:
First, apply the Liouville transformation (if possible; see, e.g.,
Everitt [3, 4]) to transform the equation to the form $$ - y'' + Q y =
\lambda y .$$ If $Q(x) \to \infty$ when $x \to \infty$, then
the $\infty$ endpoint is LP and the spectrum is discrete.</p>

property, and is discussed briefly in Zettl [1, Sect. 10.13].
Somewhat surprisingly, there is a simple sharp condition for the BD
property discovered by Molchanov. The Liouville-transformed system 
(i.e., $p=w=1$) has
the BD property if and only if, for some $h, 0 &lt; h &lt; \infty$,
$$\int_t^{t+h}Q(x)\,dx \to \infty$$

 One class of covering spaces for $S^1\vee S^1$ comes from covering spaces of one of the $S^1$'s and attaching copies of the other $S^1$ at each lifted base point.  That is, a space which is an $S^1$ along with $n\geq 1$ copies of $S^1$ wedged to it at different points.

\mathbb{E}(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{4s}\mathrm{sech}^2\left(\frac{x-\mu}{2s}\right)
$$
firstly lets change variables $t = \frac{x-\mu}{2s}\to dt = \frac{1}{2s}dx$
so we have
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty x\frac{1}{4s}\mathrm{sech}^2\left(\frac{x-\mu}{2s}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \left(2st +\mu\right)\mathrm{sech}^2t \,dt
$$ 
we can use the relation
$$
 \frac{d}{dx}\tanh x = \mathrm{sech}^2 x 
$$
this leads to
$$
\frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \left(2st +\mu\right)\mathrm{sech}^2t \,dt = \frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \left(2st +\mu\right)\frac{d}{dt}\tanh t\,dt
$$
so we compute
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty t\frac{d}{dt}\tanh t = \left[t\tanh (t)\right]_{-\infty}^\infty - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \tanh (t) \,dt
$$
Since we have
$$
\tanh(-x) = -\tanh(x)
$$
i.e odd function with another odd function
$$
-t\tanh(-t) = -t\cdot -\tanh(t) = t\tanh(t)
$$
we have an even function which for symmetric bounds vanishes the term in the brackets.
The integral left is
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \tanh (t) dt
$$
we can use a similar argument
$$
\int_{-\infty}^0 \tanh (t) dt + \int_{0}^\infty\tanh (t) dt
$$
change of variables for the first integral
$$
\int_{\infty}^0 \tanh(-t) (-dt) = -\int_{\infty}^0 \tanh(-t)dt = \int_0^\infty \tanh(-t)dt = -\int_0^\infty \tanh(t)dt 
$$
so 
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \tanh (t) dt = -\int_0^\infty \tanh(t)dt  + \int_{0}^\infty\tanh (t) dt = 0
$$
this leaves us with
$$
\frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \left(2st +\mu\right)\frac{d}{dt}\tanh t\,dt = s\int_{-\infty}^\infty t\frac{d}{dt}\tanh t\,dt + \frac{1}{2}\mu \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{d}{dt}\tanh t\,dt = \frac{1}{2}\mu \left[\tanh(t)\right]_{-\infty}^\infty
$$
using the similar argument again
$$
\frac{1}{2}\mu \left[\tanh(\infty) - \tanh(-\infty)\right] = \frac{1}{2}\mu\left[1 -(-1)\right] = \mu.

"2389143","2389156","<p>An effort for an informal explanation: The story is the following: you have a random variable $X$ that is distributed according to some probability density function $f_X(x)$. But you do not know some parameter of this function $f$. For example $f_X(x)=ax+b$ but you do not know $a$. So, right $f(x; a)$ instead (ok?).</p>

<p>Now, you start taking observations from $X$, formally you take a sample of independent random variables $X_1,X_2,\dots, X_n$ and you observe them, in order to get some information about $a$ (which you do not know, remember?). What do I mean by that: $X_1$ denotes the result (which you do not know yet) of your first sample. So, just observe it and write $X_1=x_1$ (where $x_1$ is what you saw, it is a number). To see the difference between $X_1$ and $x_1$: let's say, you forgot what you saw (you wrote it somewhere and you lost the note), then you repeat the observation and you get $X_1=x_1'$. Got it? </p>

<p>So, you take $n$ observations. Now, ask: What is the likelihood that I will observe $(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$. Answer: these observations are independent and each one comes from the distribution $f$, so (by the multiplicative law
$$f(x_1,x_2,\dots x_n ; a)=f(x_1; a)f(x_2;a)\dots f(x_n;a)=\prod_{i=1}^nf(x_i;a)$$ and that is your likelihood function, or informally ""the likelihood that you observed what you observed"". Now, maximize this with respect to $a$. That is were your theory takes over.</p>

"2389147","2389188","<p>Consider a number of the form $8n+3$. Its trajectory goes: $8n+3, 24n+10, 12n+5, 36n+16, 18n+8, 9n+4$. Thus, the stopping time for $9n+4$ is $5$ less than the stopping time for $8n+3$. The number $9n+4$ has approximately the ratio $9/8$ to the number $8n+3$, so its logarithm is greater by approximately $\log 9/8$, and its stopping time is less by $5$. That's the regularity along downward sloping lines that you're seeing.</p>

<p>Additionally, $f^5(8n+1)=9n+2$, and $f^5(8n+6)=9n+8$</p>

<p>Next, consider a number of the form $8n+1$. Its trajectory goes: $8n+1, 24n+4, 12n+2, 6n+1$. The ratio of $8n+1$ to $6n+1$ is about $4/3$. Thus, in those cases, when the logarithm decreases by about $\log 4/3$, the stopping time decreases by $3$. That's the regularity along the lines with positive slope.</p>

<p>Additionally, $f^3(8n+2)=6n+2$, $f^3(8n+4)=6n+4$, $f^3(8n+5)=6n+4$, and $f^3(8n+6)=6n+5$.</p>

<p>Note that two of those are the same: thus, $3$ steps upstream of every $6n+4$, we find an $8n+4$ <em>and</em> an $8n+5$.</p>

<hr>

<p>These two regularities intermesh because of the Chinese Remainder Theorem. In many cases, one of those $6n+k$ numbers is also an $8n+j$ number, so a step down-and-to-the-left is followed by another step down, to the left and/or to the right.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are still horizontal runs of points to explain, clustered around intersections in the lattice. First, as noted above, $f^3(8n+4)=f^3(8n+5)=6n+4$. Their trajectories converge after $3$ steps, so they have the same stopping time.</p>

<p>Similarly, $16n+8$ and $16n+10$ have the same stopping time, with $f^4(16n+8)=f^4(16n+10)$.</p>

<hr>

<p>I will also comment on some confusion in the problem. The $dt$ within the integrand serves to indicate what variable is being integrated. In this case, it's the $t$ variable. But the integral is a function of $x$. That is, there is a function in your question that we might call $g(x)$, given by
$$ g(x) = \int_2^x \frac{dt}{t + \ln t}.$$
This function has the interpretation ""give the area under the graph of the function $1/(t + \ln t)$ from $2$ to $x$"". So the $x$ and the $t$ are playing different roles: $t$ is what is being integrated, while $x$ is the variable of the overall function.</p>

"2389239","2389304","<p>Consider first how to compute the trace of an operator. Given an orthonormal basis $\{e_1,...,e_n\}$ of a finite dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal H$, we can compute the trace of an operator $A: \mathcal H \to \mathcal H$ as $$\text{tr}(A)= \sum_{j=1}^n \langle e_j,Ae_j \rangle$$ where $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle$ is the inner product on $\mathcal H$. Next think about how we represent $A$ as a matrix. Really what we do is some coordinate isomorphism $\mathcal H \cong \mathbb C^n$ where 
$$e_1 \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\0 \\ \vdots \\ 0\end{pmatrix} \hspace{1cm} e_2 \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\1 \\ \vdots \\ 0\end{pmatrix} \hspace{0.5cm} ... \hspace{0.5cm} e_n \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\0 \\ \vdots \\ n\end{pmatrix} \hspace{1cm}$$ and the columns of $A$ represent it's action on each of the basis vectors. This basis is then orthonormal with respect to the standard inner product on $\mathbb C^n$: $$\Bigg\langle \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_n\end{pmatrix} \Bigg\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \overline{x_1} &amp; \overline{x_2} &amp; ... &amp; \overline{x_n} \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_n\end{pmatrix}= \sum_{j=1}^n \overline{x_j} y_j $$ which we can also write as $\langle x,y\rangle= x^\dagger y$ for any $x,y \in \mathbb C^n$. Next we use the fact that the trace is independent of which orthonormal basis was originally chosen. In this formulation of constructing the matrix $A$ we get that $$\text{tr}(A)= \sum_{j=1}^n e_j^\dagger A e_j$$ which exactly corresponds to the sum of the diagonal elements of $A$ in the reference basis. </p>

<p>This idea can be generalized for the partial trace as follows. Let $\{a_1,...,a_m \}$ and $\{ b_1,...,b_n\}$ be orthonormal bases for two Hilbert spaces $\mathcal H_A$ and $\mathcal H_B$ respectively. We choose the reference basis of $\mathcal H_A \otimes \mathcal H_B$ to be the natural choice $\{ a_1 \otimes b_1,a_1 \otimes b_2,a_1 \otimes b_3,...,a_m \otimes b_n\}$ and represent each of these as a column vector $$a_1 \otimes b_1 \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\0 \\ \vdots \\ 0\end{pmatrix} \hspace{1cm} a_1 \otimes b_2 \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\1 \\ \vdots \\ 0\end{pmatrix} \hspace{0.5cm} ... \hspace{0.5cm} a_m \otimes b_n \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\0 \\ \vdots \\ n\end{pmatrix} \hspace{1cm}$$ in $\mathbb C^{mn}$. Then any linear operator $T:\mathcal H_A \otimes \mathcal H_B \to \mathcal H_A \otimes \mathcal H_B$ has a matrix representation as $T: \mathbb C^{mn} \to \mathbb C^{mn}$ as we constructed above. The partial trace can then be computed by performing this sum of inner products with the basis of $\mathcal H_B$ only $$\text{tr}_B(T)= \sum_{j=1}^n (\text{id}_A \otimes b_j^\dagger)T (\text{id}_A \otimes b_j) $$ where $\text{id}_A$ is the $m \times m$ identity matrix and $b_j$ is $j^{th}$ coordinate vector in $\mathbb C^n$. Each $\text{id}_A \otimes b_j$ is therefore a $mn \times m$ matrix and each $\text{id}_A \otimes b_j^\dagger$ is an $m \times mn$ matrix resulting in an operator on $\mathbb C^m$ from which you can reverse the coordinate isomorphism to get back to $\mathcal H_A$. So in summary</p>

<ol>

"2389246","2389260","<p>You have to consider two different cases separately: $0&lt;x&lt;1$ and $x&gt;1$. The solution you presented here is only valid for the latter case when $x&gt;1$.

<p>By the way, you seem to have made a similar mistake when finishing your solution too. Solving the quadratic inequality gives you $u&lt;-1$ or $u&gt;\frac{2}{3}$. As you pointed out, the equation $\left(\frac{4}{9}\right)^x=-1$ has no solutions; moreover, the inequality $\left(\frac{4}{9}\right)^x&lt;-1$ has no solutions either. But the other root gives you an inequality
$$u&gt;\frac{2}{3} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \left(\frac{4}{9}\right)^x&gt;\frac{2}{3} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad x\color{red}{&lt;}\frac{1}{2}.$$
Again, the inequality sign flips because the base is less than $1$. Notice that this solution was for the case $x&gt;1$, so in the end we see that this case has no solutions (the outcome $x&lt;\frac{1}{2}$ contradicts the case condition $x&gt;1$). But you still have the other case to solve.</p>

"2389268","2389316","<p>Your rephrasing of the original problem lacks some information which is crucial for the result to hold.  Let's go back to the <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2386829/problem-of-rank-trace-determinant-and-eigenvalue/2386886#2386886"">original problem</a> and see how every piece of information is used to get the required result. You are given that $A' + B' = I$ and $A'B' = 0$.</p>

<ol>
<li>The first observation is that by multiplying $A' + B' = I$ by $A'$ from the left and using $A'B' = 0$, we get $A'^2 = A'$. Similarly, by multiplying the identity by $B'$ from the right, we get $B'^2 = B'$. Those conditions tell you that $A',B'$ are projections so they are diagonalizable with possible eigenvalues $0,1$.</li>
<li>Let's assume we are given a projection $P = P^2$. Any vector $v \in \mathbb{F}^n$ decomposes as $v = Pv + (v - Pv)$ where $Pv \in \operatorname{im}(P)$ and $v - Pv \in \ker(P)$ (since $P(v - Pv) = Pv - P^2v = 0$). Hence, $\mathbb{F}^n = \operatorname{ker}(P) + \operatorname{im}(P)$. Since $n = \dim \operatorname{ker}(P) + \dim \operatorname{im}(P)$, this is a direct sum decomposition so $\ker(P) \oplus \operatorname{im}(P) = \mathbb{F}^n$. The image $\operatorname{im}(P)$ is also the eigenspace of $P$ associated to the eigenvalue $1$ while the kernel is the eigenspace of $P$ associated to the eigenvalue $0$. To see why, note that $\ker(P - I) \subseteq \operatorname{im}(P)$ while if $v = Pw \in \operatorname{im}(P)$ then $Pv = P^2w = Pw = v$. Finally, the map $Q = I - P$ also satisfies $Q^2 = Q$ so it is a projection whose image is $\ker(P)$ and whose kernel is $\operatorname{im}(P)$ (check this!).</li>
<li>Consider the space $V$ which is the eigenspace of $A'$ associated to the eigenvalue $1$. By the previous item, $V$ is <strong>also</strong> the kernel of $I - A' = B'$. Similarly, $W$ is <strong>also</strong> the kernel of $I - B' = A'$. In particular, we have $V \oplus W = \mathbb{R}^n$.</li>
<li>Using the above, we see now that if $v \in V$ and $w \in W$ then
$$ (A + B)v = \frac{A'}{x}v + \frac{B'}{y}v = \frac{v}{x} + 0 = \frac{v}{x}, \\
(A + B)w = \frac{A'}{x}w + \frac{B'}{y}w = 0 + \frac{w}{y} = \frac{w}{y}$$
so indeed $V$ is the eigenspace of $A + B$ associated to the eigenvalue $\frac{1}{x}$ and $W$ is the eigenspace of $A + B$ associated to the eigenvalue $\frac{1}{y}$.</li>
<li>Since $\det(A + B)$ is the product of the eigenvalues of $A + B$, we immediately get
$$ \det(A + B) = \frac{1}{x}^{\operatorname{dim} V} \frac{1}{y}^{\operatorname{dim} W}. $$</li>

"2389303","2389320","<p>I don't know why your notes say what they say.

<p>How do I know all that? Because five years ago I made that same mistake.</p>

<p>So we say that a set $\alpha$ is an ordinal if it is <em>transitive</em> and strictly well-ordered by the $\in$ relation. And for two ordinals $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we write $\alpha&lt;\beta$ if $\alpha\in\beta$.</p>

<p>It is necessary to require that the well-order is strict, since otherwise if we do not assume the Axiom of Regularity, it is possible that there is some $x=\{x\}$, which is then certainly a transitive set which is well-ordered by $\in$. But it is not strictly well-ordered by $\in$, since $x\in x$. And it is also necessary to assume that the set is transitive, since every singleton $x$ such that $x\neq\{x\}$ is strictly well-ordered by $\in$, whereas you want your universe to have exactly one ordinal which is a singleton.</p>

"2389337","2389359","<p>If you have more rows that columns, then all rows can <strong>NOT</strong> be linearly independent &mdash; but then, it actually does <strong>NOT</strong> matter here. You have the right answer in your second paragraph: if you know that all $N$ columns of the coefficient matrix are linearly independent, and if you know that solutions exist, then it has to be the case of a unique solution, since in this case
$$\operatorname{rank}(\text{coefficient matrix})=\operatorname{rank}(\text{augmented matrix})=\text{number of variables}.$$</p>

<p>The extra equations in this case don't affect the number of solutions. They just happen to be extraneous, or redundant, equations.

You can see that in this case:
$$\operatorname{rank}(\text{coefficient matrix})=\operatorname{rank}(\text{augmented matrix})=\text{number of variables}=1,$$

"2389370","2389409","<p>At first, why did you suppose that $\inf X$ does exist? Think of $\mathbb{R}$, which is unbounded below.</p>

<p>Now, nack to our proof. Let $E$ be a bounded from above, non-empty subset of $X$. Since we only know that $X$ has the g.l.b. property, we need to construct a set that is bounded from below and, of course is non-empty. So, since $E$ is bounded from above, there exists an $a\in X$ such that:
$$x\leq a\ \forall x\in E$$
Now, consider
$$F:=\{x\in X:x\geq y,\ \forall y\in E\}$$
So, it is clear that $a\in F$, so $\varnothing\neq F\subseteq X$. Moreover, since $E$ is non-empty, there exists a $b\in E$, so, it is clear by $F$'s definition, that:
$$b\leq x,\ \forall x\in F$$
so $F$ is bounded from below. Due to our hypothesis, there exists an $s\in X$ such that:
$$s=\inf F$$
Now, we claim that $s\in X$ is an upper bound of $E$. </p>

<p>Let us suppose that there exists a $x\in E$ such that

<p>Frustration is normal. Super normal. It's something I've become familiar with the last two years. The big thing, at least for me, is to push on. I also tell my students to ""know when to quit."" What that means is not when to give up, but when to step away, take a break, and come back with a clear head. Sometimes a solution comes after you've slept for the night, had a meal, or played a video game.</p>

<p>Of course, managing the frustration needs to be done healthily. Admittedly, I've wanted to throw things across the room, break cups and plates, even light things on fire (I didn't, thankfully). This behavior has also led to drinking more than I should. Find healthy ways to relieve stress - take a walk, eat a snack, talk to a friend, laugh at a comedy.</p>

"2389424","2389444","<p><strong>Definition:</strong> We will say that a function $f : \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $a$ if</p>

<ol>
<li>$\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ exists,</li>
<li>$f(a)$ is defined, and</li>
<li>$\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = f(a)$.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Proposition:</strong> The function $f : \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ defined by

\end{equation*}
is continuous at zero.</p>

<p><em>Proof:</em>  From the definition of continuity, it is sufficient to show that $\lim_{x\to 0} f(x)$ exists, and is equal to $f(0) = 0$.  Observe that since $\cos(\theta) \in [-1,1]$ for all real numbers $\theta$, we have
$$ 0 \le |f(x)| = \left| x \cos\left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right| \le |x| $$
for all $x\ne 0$.  But
$$ \lim_{x\to 0} 0 = 0
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\lim_{x\to 0} |x| = 0.$$
Therefore, by the Squeeze Theorem, we must conclude that
$$ \lim_{x\to 0} |f(x)| = 0 \implies \lim_{x\to 0} f(x) = 0, $$

<p>An alternative proof, using the $\varepsilon-\delta$ definition of continuity:</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  We will say that a function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $a$ if for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ there exists a $\delta &gt; 0$ such that
$$ |x-a| &lt; \delta \implies |f(x) - f(a)| &lt; \varepsilon.$$</p>

<p><strong>Proposition:</strong> The function $f : \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ defined by
\begin{equation*}
  f(x) := \begin{cases} x \cos\left( \frac{1}{x} \right) &amp; \text{if $x\ne 0$, and} \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
is continuous at zero.</p>

<p><em>Proof:</em>  Fix $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, and choose $\delta &lt; \varepsilon$.  If $|x-0| = |x| &lt; \delta$, then we have
$$ |f(x) - f(0)|
= \left| x\cos\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - 0\right|
=  |x| \left| \cos\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right|
&lt; \delta \left| \cos\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right|.
&lt; \varepsilon \left| \cos\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right|.
$$
As above, observe that $\cos(\theta) \in [-1,1]$ for all real $\theta$, from which it follows that
$$ |f(x) - f(0)|
&lt; \varepsilon \left| \cos\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right|
\le \varepsilon,

There are in general two points of intersection (or none if the target is out of reach). One solution will be above the line $AC$ (left pictures), the other below (right pictures).</p>

<p>$$c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\cos\gamma$$</p>

<p>which you can reformulate to</p>

<p>$$\gamma=\pm\arccos\frac{a^2+b^2-c^2}{2ab}$$</p>

<p>In your specific situation that would translate to</p>

<p>$$\beta=\arccos\frac{a_2^2+g^2-d_{34}^2}{2\,a_2\,g}
\qquad
\delta=\arccos\frac{a_2^2+d_{34}^2-g^2}{2\,a_2\,d_{34}}$$</p>

<p>since those are interior angles in $\triangle ABC$ at $A$ res. $B$ and we seem to be using positive angles everywhere. You also have</p>

<p>$$\tan\alpha=\frac{h_z}{h_{xy}}$$</p>

<p>from which you can read $\alpha$ up to a possible term of $\ldots+\pi$, just as in the computation for $q_1$. Pick that so that it matches the actual signs of $h_z$ and $h_{xy}$, use <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.atan2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>atan2</code></a> when programming.</p>

<p>The angle $\gamma$ is fixed, defined by the shape of the arm between $B$ and $C$. It should be irrelevant, if the further computation were thinking about $BC$ as a straight line segment, but that isn't the case. So you have to compute an angle in a right-angled triangle again.</p>

<p>$$\gamma=\arctan\frac{d_4}{a_3}$$</p>

<p>From all of these you can compute $q_2$ and $q_3$ as described in the paper.</p>

"2389606","2389634","<p>For $k\ge 2$, you have that $I_k$ is a closed interval and $f(x)=1/x$ is a continuous function on it, so it attains its $\min$ and its $\max$ on this interval (which Theorem is it?). Hence, for $k\ge 2$ \begin{align}\sup_{I_k}f(x)=\max_{I_k}f(x)&amp;=f(x_{k-1})\\  \inf_{I_k}f(x)=\min_{I_k}f(x)&amp;=f(x_{k})\end{align} Now, in $I_1=[0,x_1]$, you have that $\lim_{x\to 0} f(x)=+\infty$, so $$\sup_{I_1}f(x)=+\infty$$ On the other hand $f(0)=0$, and $f(x)=1/x&gt;0$ for any other $x$, so $$\inf_{I_1}f(x)=0$$</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: To elaborate on $I_1$: $f$ has exactly one value on $x=0$, which is $f(0)=0$. However, $\lim_{x\to 0+} f(x)=+\infty$, which is different than $f(0)$. This does not mean that $f$ has two values for $x=0$. It means that $f$ is discontinuous at $x=0$, since $$0=f(0)\neq \lim_{x\to0+}f(x)=+\infty$$ Now, as $x$ tends to $0$, $f(x)$ increases all the time without bounds. In other words, name a number, then there is an $x$ (very small, meaning very close to $0$) so that $f(x)=1/x$ is bigger than this number you named. This shows that $$\sup_{I_1}f(x)=\lim_{x\to 0}f(x)=+\infty$$ Note: here you have indeed a $\sup$ and not a maximum (since it is attained asymptotically). Now, for the $\inf$ things are simpler. $f$ takes the value $0$ (exactly, not asysmptotically, or anything the like, but exactly), at $x=0$ and is positive for any other value in $I_1$. Hence, $f(0)=0$ is indeed the least value of $f$ in $I_1$, which establishes that $$\inf_{I_1}f(x)=\min_{I_1}f(x)=f(0)=0$$</p>

"2389622","2390529","<p>In the paper <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/43965918?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""on hyperspace of compact subsets of $k$-spaces""</a> by Momir Stanojevic, this question is discussed. </p>

<p>It refers to a Russian paper by Popov that gives examples of $X$ that are $k$-spaces such that $\mathcal{K}(X)$ is not a $k$-space, but the author also gives a machine for producing examples:</p>

<p>Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be $k$-spaces such that $X_1 \times X_2$ is not a $k$-space.
(e.g. see Engelking 3.3.29): $X_1 = \mathbb{R}\setminus\{\frac{1}{n}: n =2,3,4\ldots\}$, $X_2 = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{N}$ (the positive integers in $\mathbb{R}$ indentified to a point, in the quotient topology). For the argument, see Engelking. We could use other examples, if you happen to know them.</p>

<p>Define $X = X_1 \oplus X_2$, their disjoint topological sum.
Then $X$ is a $k$-space, clearly.</p>

<p>But the subset $C = \{\{x_1,x_2\}: x_1 \in X_1, x_2 \in X_2\}$ is closed in $\mathcal{K}(X)$ and homeomorphic to $X_1 \times X_2$, so not a $k$-space. (check the homeomorphism and the closedness!). </p>

<p>As a closed subspace of a $k$-space is a $k$-space, this implies that $\mathcal{K}(X)$ is <em>not</em> a $k$-space. So $X$ being a $k$-space is not enough.</p>

<p>In fact from standard facts he proves that all powers $X^n$ $n=1,2,\ldots$ have to be $k$-spaces too (here the square $X^2$ fails to be a $k$-space). This one often sees: hyperspaces of $X$ behave like $X^\omega$ in many ways.</p>

<p>Stanojevic also considers iterated hyperspaces $\mathcal{K}^{(1)}(X) = \mathcal{K}(X)$ and $\mathcal{K}^{(n+1)}(X)= \mathcal{K}(\mathcal{K}^{(n)(X)})$.
There is a natural map of unions from $\mathcal{K}^{(n+1)}(X)$ to $\mathcal{K}^{(n)}(X)$ for all $n$ and the inverse limit of the inverse system so obtained, is called $\mathcal{K}^{(\omega)}(X)$.</p>

<p>Then theorem 7 in the quoted paper says that $\mathcal{K}(X)$ is a $k$-space iff for all $n \ge 2$, $\mathcal{K}^{(n)}(X)$ is a $k$-space iff $\mathcal{K}^{(\omega)}(X)$ is a $k$-space. So if such a hyperspace is a $k$-space it gets preserved by the $\mathcal{K}$-operation itself.</p>

<p>An interesting conjecture based on the above (Stanojevic does not ask this, but it seems reasonable in light of his results): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If $X^\mathbb{N}$ is a $k$-space does it follow that $\mathcal{K}(X)$ is one too?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need at least all the finite powers to be a $k$-space.</p>

"2389644","2393096","<p>We will  show that  $f(x) &gt; 0$ for $x&gt;1$ and $f(x) &lt; 0$ for $0&lt;x&lt;1$.</p>

<p>Let's start with the first one,   $f(x) &gt; 0$ for $x&gt;1$.</p>

<p>For real $p &gt; 2$, we can use Bernoulli's inequality (which holds for real exponents!):</p>

<p>$(1 + w)^r \ge 1 + r w $,  for real  $w &gt; -1$ and real $r &gt; 1$.</p>

<p>This gives for the first exponent in $f(x)$:</p>

<p>$(x+1)^{p-1} = x^{p-1} (1+1/x)^{p-1} \geq x^{p-1} (1 + \frac{p-1}{x})$</p>

<p>Inserting into $f(x)$ gives </p>

<p>$$f(x) = (x - 1)(x + 1)^{p - 1} - x^p + 1 \\\ge (x - 1)x^{p-1} (1 + \frac{p-1}{x}) - x^p + 1 \\= x^{p-1} (p-2) - x^{p-2} (p-1) + 1 = h(x)$$</p>

<p>with equality  for $x=1$. Now note that $h(x=1) = 0$. Further,</p>

<p>$h'(x) = (p-2)(p-1)x^{p-3} (x-1)$</p>

<p>so for $x&gt;1$, $h'(x) &gt; 0$ everywhere. Hence $h(x) \geq 0$ with equality  for $x=1$. This establishes that for $x\geq 1$, $f(x) \geq 0$ with equality  for $x=1$. </p>

<p>For the second case $0&lt;x&lt;1$, we will see now that this can be reduced to the first case $x&gt;1$, so indeed there is nothing to do.</p>

<p>Let $y =\sqrt x$. Then the function  becomes:</p>

<p>$$
f(y = \sqrt x) = y^p \left[ (y - \frac1y)(y + \frac1y)^{p - 1} - y^p + \dfrac{1}{y^p} \right]
$$</p>

<p>We have shown above that for $y&gt;1$, $f(y) &gt;0$. I.e. we have that the following inequality holds:</p>

<p>$$
g(y) =  (y - \frac1y)(y + \frac1y)^{p - 1} - y^p + \dfrac{1}{y^p}  &gt; 0 \qquad \bf\text{[ineq. 1]}
$$</p>

<p>Now, we want to show that for $0&lt;y&lt;1$, $f(y) &lt;0$. Here, we need  to show</p>

<p>$$
g(y) =(-y + \frac1y)(y + \frac1y)^{p-1} -[- y^p + \dfrac{1}{y^p} ]&gt; 0
$$
Now replacing $y$ by $1/y$ we get $y &gt; 1$ and, in the replaced variable,<br>
$$
\tilde g(y) =  (y - \frac1y)(y + \frac1y)^{p - 1} - y^p + \dfrac{1}{y^p} &gt; 0
$$
So this is the same condition as before in ineq. 1, which has already been proven.</p>

"2389645","2389646","<p>Hint: $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0^{-}}{x}=0$.</p>

<p>You first evaluate the limit and then take the floor value.</p>
"
"2389656","2389662","<p>You have discovered a variant of the standard functional iteration or fixed point iteration. The standard iteration is $$x_{n+1} = f(x_n).$$ You are using $$x_{n+1} = g(x_n),$$ where $$g(x) = (x + f(x))/2.$$ Both iterations will converge, if $f : I \rightarrow I$ is a contraction, i.e., there exists $L \in [0,1)$, such that
$$ |f(x) - f(y)| \leq L | x-y|$$
for all $x, y \in I$. </p>

<p>It would be interesting to know if there are cases where your iteration converges faster than the standard iteration.</p>

<p>As for efficiency, I recommend that you use the functional iteration to get close to the root, then apply the secant method which converges substantially faster. Ideally, you would merge the secant method with the bisection method to obtain a method which is both fast and robust because it maintains a bracket around the root.</p>
"
"2389667","2389744","<p>Firstly, you can't just push the parts of a (partial) derivative $\partial u/\partial x$ around as you like: $\partial u/\partial x$ is one quantity, that happens to be composed of a number of symbols. This is clearer if you write it as $u_x$ or $u_{,x}$.</p>

<p>The next problem is that while for total derivatives or functions of one variable
$$ \frac{dy}{dx} \frac{dx}{dy} = 1, $$
the same is not the case for partial derivatives, as the following example will illustrate: let
$$ u = x+y, \qquad v=x-y. $$
Then inverting gives
$$ x = \frac{u+v}{2} \qquad y = \frac{u-v}{2}. $$
So,
$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 1 \qquad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 1 \\
\frac{\partial x}{\partial u} = \frac{1}{2} \qquad \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} = \frac{1}{2},
$$
and therefore
$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} = \frac{1}{2} \qquad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} = \frac{1}{2}, $$
so the sum is $1$, but the products are not $1$ individually.</p>

<p>A further instructive example is the even simpler-looking example
$$ u = x + ay, \qquad v = y. $$
Then
$$ x = u-av \qquad y = v. $$
So $ \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 0 $, but
$$ \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} = -a. $$
This tells us two interesting things: firstly, what we already know about the product not being $1$. And secondly, that although $y=v$, $\partial x/\partial y = 0 $ ($x$ and $y$ are meant to be independent to start with, after all!), so $ \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} \neq \frac{\partial x}{\partial y} $. What does this mean? It means that the partial derivative very much depends on what is being held constant, in addition to what is allowed to vary.</p>

<p>In the case of $\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}$, the coordinates other than $y$ (namely $x$) is being held constant, so of course this gives zero. But in $\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}$, $u$ is being held constant, and since this is not the same as $x$, the answer is different. This is one of the most difficult, and most important, things to understand about partial derivatives. There's a nice illustration of this on <a href=""https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VWTNCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">p.190 of Penrose's <em>Road to Reality</em></a>.</p>

<p>The correct approach is to apply the chain rule for partial derivatives, namely that if $f$ is a function of $x,y,z$, which in turn are functions of $u$ and other variables, then
$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = \frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial y}{\partial u}\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial u}\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}. $$
If then $f=u$, the result follows.</p>
"
"2389674","2390645","<p>Assuming that the plane passes through the origin, this problem comes down to finding the intersection of the plane with the nappe of the cone defined by $\mathbf v$ and $\mathbf r$. This intersection will consist of up to two rays. Finding unit vectors in the directions of these rays is easy, from which vectors you can get the corresponding rotation angles or otherwise construct the rotation using your favorite method.  </p>

<p>The first thing to do is to check whether or not there is a non-trivial intersection. This can be done by comparing the angles between the rotation axis $\mathbf r$, and $\mathbf v$ and the plane represented by $\mathbf n$, respectively, or, more conveniently, their cosines. Since we’re working with unit vectors, there will be an intersection when $$(\mathbf v\cdot\mathbf r)^2\le1-(\mathbf n\cdot\mathbf r)^2.$$</p>

<p>You can solve the cone-plane intersection problem directly, but I find it easier to transform everything so that the cone is aligned with the $z$-axis. A rotation will do the trick, but I think it’s faster and easier to use a Householder reflection instead. So, compute the transformation matrix $$H=I-2{\mathbf a\mathbf a^T\over\mathbf a^T\mathbf a}$$ where $\mathbf a=\mathbf r-(0,0,1)^T$. This is a reflection in the plane that bisects the angle between $\mathbf v$ and $\mathbf r$. The advantage of using this transformation instead of a rotation is that $H=H^T=H^{-1}=H^{-T}$, so the same matrix can be used to transform back to the original coordinate system and to transform the normal vector $\mathbf n$. (That’s a covariant vector, so if points are transformed as $M\mathbf p$, it transforms as $M^{-T}\mathbf n$.) In practice, you might not need to construct this matrix, since you can directly compute $H\mathbf p=\mathbf p-2{\mathbf p\cdot\mathbf a\over\mathbf a\cdot\mathbf a}\mathbf a$ and only need to map a few vectors.  </p>

<p>Set $\mathbf v'=H\mathbf v$ and $\mathbf n'=H\mathbf n$. The vectors that we’re looking for are the intersections of the transformed plane with the circle $x'^2+y'^2=1-(z_{\mathbf v}')^2$, $z'=z_{\mathbf v}'$ (i.e., the circle that is the intersection of the transformed cone nappe with the plane $z'=z_{\mathbf v}'$). Note, by the way, that $z_{\mathbf v}'=\mathbf v\cdot\mathbf r$. Following the method described <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2387489/265466"">here</a>, reduce this to a two-dimensional problem by computing the intersection of the transformed target plane with $z'=z_{\mathbf v}'$ and project onto the $x'$-$y'$ plane. For the present problem, this amounts to multiplying the third coordinate of $\mathbf n'$ by $z_{\mathbf v}'$, i.e., $\mathbf l=\operatorname{diag}(1,1,z_{\mathbf v}')\,\mathbf n'$. Proceeding as in the linked answer, find the intersection of this line with the circle $x'^2+y'^2=1-(z_{\mathbf v}')^2$ and project back onto the $z'=z_{\mathbf v}'$ plane to get unit vectors $\mathbf w_1'$ and $\mathbf w_2'$ (which might be identical).  </p>

<p>With these vectors in hand, you can proceed in several ways to derive the corresponding rotations. The rotation angle required to take $\mathbf v$ to $\mathbf w_i=H\mathbf w_i'$ is just the negation of the angle between the projections of $\mathbf v'$ and $\mathbf w_i'$ onto the $x'$-$y'$ plane (negated because $H$ is orientation-reversing), and once you have this angle, you can use well-known formulas to construct an appropriate rotation matrix or quaternion. You could also construct a rotation matrix $R'$ in the transformed frame, which will just be a rotation about the $z'$-axis, and then transform it back to the original coordinate system: $R=HR'H$. (This is another instance in which the identity $H=H^T=H^{-1}=H^{-T}$ comes in handy.)  </p>

<p>For numerical stability, you might want to align the rotation axis with one of the other coordinate axes. The best choice in that regard is the standard basis vector $\mathbf e_i$ which maximizes $\|\mathbf r-\mathbf e_i\|$. Getting back to the above solution is a simple matter of permuting coordinates after applying $H$, but be sure you keep track of orientation changes if you’re going to use the computed rotation angles directly.</p>

"2389678","2389696","<p><strong>For the part that you were missing/asking for Question 2:</strong></p>

<p>Since $B$ is symmetric $B=U^tDU$ for some diagonal matrix $D$ and some orthogonal matrix $U$.</p>

<p>If $E$ is invariant for $B$ then $U(E)$ is invariant for $D$. Therefore $D$ has an eigenvector $u$ there. It follows that $U^tu$ is an eigenvector for $B$ and belongs to $E$. Therefore is is also an eigenvector for $A$.</p>

<p>It is interesting that this part didn't need that $A$ was symmetric. But you used it to ascertain that $A$ does have an eigenvector. Therefore in question 2 one only needs to know that $A$ has an eigenvector.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong></p>

<p>Assume all eigenvalues of $A$ are zero and $E$ is its kernel. Then $B(E)\subset E$. Therefore there is an eigenvector of $B$ in $E$ and that would be a common eigenvector for $A$ and $B$. It would correspond to the eigenvalues $0$ for $A$ and perhaps to some other eigenvalue for $B$.</p>

<p>Assume now that not all eigenvalues of $A$ are zero. Let $r\neq0$ be one non-zero eigenvalue of $A$ and $E$ its eigenspace.</p>

<p>Then for all $v\in E$, $ABv=BA^2v=r^2Bv$. If $Bv=0$ for some non-zero $v\in E$ we are done, $v$ is eigenvector of $B$ and of $A$. </p>

<p>Assume then that $Bv\neq0$ for all $0\neq v\in E$. Therefore $r^2$ is eigenvalue of $A$. Now, for $0\neq v\in E$, $AB^2v=BA^2Bv=B^2A^4v=r^4B^2v$. Again, if $B^2v=0$ then $Bv$ is a common eigenvector of $A$ and $B$, of eigenvalue $r^2$ for $A$ and $0$ for $B$. If you assume that $B^2v\neq0$ for all such $v$, then $r^4$ is an eigevalue of $A$.</p>

<p>Continuing in this way we would find either a common eigevector of $A$ and $B$, or a sequence $r,r^2,r^4,...$ of eigenvalues of $A$. Since there are only finitely many eigenvalues we must have $r^m=r^s$ for some $m\neq s$. Since $|r|\neq1$ we must have $r=0$. But we assumed $r\neq0$. Therefore, in this process we should always find a common eigenvalue.</p>

"2389719","2389908","<p><strong>Imbalance.</strong> I will begin by addressing your misgivings about grossly
different sample sizes.</p>

<p>A 'balanced' experiment in which the numbers $n_1$ and $n_2$ of subjects
in the two groups are equal is most efficient. ""A chain is only a strong as it's
weakest link."" For you, group A with $n_1 = 984$ subjects is the weak link, compared
with group B with $n_2 = 1974.$ So, <em>very</em> roughly speaking, you would
have about as much 'power' to distinguish between groups if $n_2 \approx 984.$
But a somewhat suboptimal design hardly makes the data worthless.</p>

<p><strong>Test for difference of two proportions.</strong> This situation requires a standard test for comparing two proportions. You want to
test $H_0: p_1 = p_2$ against $H_a: p_1 \ne p_2,$ where $p_1$ and $p_2$
are the proportions of positive responses in the <em>populations</em>
represented by groups A and B, respectively. You can find versions of this
test based on normal approximations to the binomial distributions in most
elementary texts. With sample sizes as large as yours, the normal
approximation should work fine.</p>

<p>Versions of the test vary slightly from one textbook
to another. I will show you results from Minitab 17 software for one of the versions
and also for Fisher's Exact Test.
You have about $X_1 = 0.107(984) = 105$ positive results in Group A and 
$X_2 = 0.062(1974) = 122$ positive results in Group B. (These numbers
are necessary input to the Minitab procedure; because of rounded proportions
I cannot recover these counts exactly, but close enough for a valid test.)</p>

<pre><code>Test and CI for Two Proportions 

Sample    X     N  Sample p
1       108   984  0.109756
2       122  1974  0.061803

Difference = p (1) - p (2)
Estimate for difference:  0.0479527
95% CI for difference:  (0.0257200, 0.0701853)
Test for difference = 0 (vs ≠ 0):  Z = 4.23  P-Value = 0.000

Fisher’s exact test: P-Value = 0.000
</code></pre>

<p>The very small P-values (below 0.0005) indicate that you can reject $H_0$
at any reasonable significance level. That is, it would be extremely
unlikely to get sample proportions as far apart as observed here if the populations
A and B had equal proportions of positive results.</p>

<p>[Also notice the confidence interval given in the output. It does not contain $0.$
This is an indication that the two groups are dissimilar as to proportion of
positive results.]</p>

<p>So the bottom line is that, although the design is technically somewhat inefficient, you have plenty of information in these data to reach a
solid statistical conclusion.</p>

<p>I hope you can find a version of this test comparing two proportions in
your textbook. The result is sufficiently strong that it shouldn't
make any difference which version you use. </p>

"2389726","2389731","<p>Yes. If you take out one axiom (the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_regularity"" rel=""noreferrer"">Axiom of Regularity</a>, which roughly disallows sets to be nested inside themselves), then ZFC is perfectly happy with the existence of sets $x$ such that $x = \{x\}$. Such sets $x$ are usually known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urelement#Quine_atoms"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Quine atoms</strong></a>.</p>

<p>In fact there are many well-known set theories that explicitly allow the existence of Quine atoms, sometimes as a matter of principle --- <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Foundations"" rel=""noreferrer"">New Foundations</a>, for instance.</p>

<p>Of course it will never be the case for <strong><em>all</em></strong> $x$ that $x = \{x\}$. This would give a contradiction. Specifically, we can prove that $\varnothing \ne \{\varnothing\}$.

<p>Given your intended computer programming application, I will also mention that there are programming languages which treat $x$ and $\{x\}$ as the same thing. This is not a problem, there is no contradiction, because ""sets"" in these languages are much more restricted than the sets of set theory. Typically, $\{\varnothing\}$ will not be an allowed set, and in general there is only a single level of nesting (i.e., no sets-of-sets).</p>

"2389735","2389797","<p>Let's assume you have a population of size $N$ with values $x_1,\ldots,x_N$, mean $\bar x=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i$ and variance $\sigma^2=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i-\bar x)^2$. (Note that I use lower case $x_i$ to indicate these are not random, but fixed values.)</p>

<p>Now, let's take a random sample $Y_1,\ldots,Y_n$ of $n$ elements (without replacement), with all such subsets equally likely. (Now I use capital $Y$ to indicate these are random.)</p>

<p>Now, $\bar Y=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$ and let $V=\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-\bar Y)^2$ so that the sample variance would be $V/n$ (like the expression for $\sigma^2$). If we write $V$ out in terms of $(Y_i-\bar x)^2$ and $(Y_i-\bar x)(Y_j-\bar x)$, we get
$$
\begin{split}
V
=&amp; \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-\bar Y)^2
= \sum_{i=1}^n \left[(Y_i-\bar x)-(\bar Y-\bar x)\right]^2 \\
=&amp; \sum_{i=1}^n \left[(Y_i-\bar x)^2-2(Y_i-\bar x)(\bar Y-\bar x)+(\bar Y-\bar x)^2 \right] \\
=&amp; \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-\bar x)^2 - n(\bar Y-\bar x)^2 \\
=&amp; \left(1-\frac{1}{n} \right) \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-\bar x)^2
  -\frac{2}{n}\sum_{1\le i&lt;j\le n} (Y_i-\bar x)(Y_j-\bar x)
\end{split}
$$
where in the last step we use that
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-\bar x)\right)^2
= \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-\bar x)^2 + 2\sum_{1\le i&lt;j\le n} (Y_i-\bar x)(Y_j-\bar x).
$$</p>

<p>We know that $\text{E}[(Y_i-\bar x)^2]=\sigma^2$: this is just taking the average of $(Y_i-\bar x)^2$ for $Y_i$ sampled from $x_1,\ldots,N$.</p>

<p>For $i&lt;j$, we can compute $\text{E}[(Y_i-\bar x)(Y_j-\bar x)]$ by using that this is the same as the average of $(x_i-\bar x)(x_j-\bar x)$ for all $1\le i&lt;j\le N$. Since $\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\bar x)=0$, we get
$$
0 = \sum_{1\le i,j\le N} (x_i-\bar x)(x_j-\bar x)
= \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\bar x)^2 + 2\sum_{1\le i&lt;j\le N} (x_i-\bar x)(x_j-\bar x)
$$
which for $i&lt;j$ makes
$$
\text{E}\left[(Y_i-\bar x)(Y_j-\bar x)\right]
= -\frac{\sigma^2}{N-1}.
$$
Combining these results, we get
$$
\text{E}[V] = (n-1)\sigma^2 + \frac{n-1}{N-1}\sigma^2
= \frac{(n-1)N}{N-1}\sigma^2
$$
giving an unbiased estimator
$$
\hat\sigma^2 = \frac{N-1}{N(n-1)}V
= \frac{N-1}{N(n-1)} \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-\bar Y)^2.
$$</p>

<p>As $N\rightarrow\infty$, you get the familiar $s^2$ estimator which corresponds to independent sampling from a distribution, while $n=N$ gives just $\sigma^2$ as it should when the $x_i$ are known for the whole population.</p>

<p>These are isomorphic $\mathrm{Iso}_1(\mathbb{O})\cong\mathrm{Iso}_2(\mathbb{O})$ via $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)\leftrightarrow(\alpha,\beta,{}^C\gamma)$, where $C(z):=\overline{z}$ is octonion conjugation and ${}^C\gamma:=C\circ\gamma\circ C^{-1}$ is group-theoretic conjugation, because $xyz=1\Leftrightarrow xy=\bar{z}$ and $\alpha(x)\beta(y)\gamma(z)=1\Leftrightarrow\alpha(x)\beta(y)=\overline{\gamma(z)}$ (replace $z$ with $\overline{z}$ in latter of each iff).</p>

<p>There is also a third manifestation. For real vector spaces, a duality is a nondegenerate bilinear pairing $V_1\times V_2\to\mathbb{R}$. A <strong>triality</strong> is a trilinear mapping $V_1\times V_2\times V_3\to\mathbb{R}$ for which fixing one argument yields a duality of the other two vector spaces. Without loss of generality, $V_1,V_2,V_3$ are the same inner product space and dualizing yields an equivalent multiplication operation $V\otimes V\to V$; the corresponding condition is that it makes $V$ a division algebra.</p>

<p>In the case of $\mathbb{O}$, multiplication gives the triality $t(x,y,z)=\langle xy,z\rangle$ (up to conjugation on $z$ this is the same as the more symmetric form $\langle xy,\bar{z}\rangle=\mathrm{Re}(xyz)$). The symmetries of the triality $t$ are all $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)\in\mathrm{SO}(8)^3$ such that $t(\alpha(x),\beta(y),\gamma(z))=t(x,y,z)$. Call this $\mathrm{Iso}_3(\mathbb{O})$. Again I don't recall offhand why, but this is isomorphic to the other two isotopy groups. (Another exercise for readers.)</p>

<p>In any case, let's just look at $\mathrm{Iso}_1(\mathbb{O})$. One of the <strong>Moufang identities</strong>, $(ax)(ya)=a(xy)a$, is the same as saying $(L_a,R_a,B_a)\in\mathrm{Iso}_1(\mathbb{O})$. Since $B_a$s generate $\mathrm{SO}(8)$, the group homomorphism $\mathrm{Iso}_1(\mathbb{O})\to\mathrm{SO}(8)$ given by $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)\mapsto\gamma$ is onto. The kernel is $\mathbb{Z}_2$ with nontrivial element $(-I,-I,I)$ (another exercise for readers), so the map is $2$-to-$1$. With some work one can show it is connected and conclude $\mathrm{Iso}_1(\mathbb{O})=\mathrm{Spin}(8)$, but that is actually not necessary for your goal.</p>

<p>There is an action of $S_3$ on $\mathrm{Iso}_2(\mathbb{O})$ by automorphisms (in fact this gives all of $\mathrm{Out}(\mathrm{Spin}(8))\cong S_3$, but again you don't need this). One of the $3$-cycles acts by $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)\mapsto(\gamma,\alpha,\beta)$, and one of the $2$-cycles acts by $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)\mapsto({}^C\beta,{}^C\alpha,{}^C\gamma)$. This is because $xyz=1\Leftrightarrow zxy=1$ (apply $z$ on left and $\bar{z}$ on right), and conjugating $xyz=1\Leftrightarrow \alpha(x)\beta(y)\gamma(z)=1$ yields $$\bar{z}\bar{y}\bar{z}=1\Leftrightarrow\overline{\gamma(z)}\,\,\overline{\beta(y)}\,\,\overline{\alpha(x)}=1$$</p>

<p>(then replace $\bar{z},\bar{y},\bar{x}$ with $x,y,z$ respectively). Thus, $S_3$ acts by permuting the coordinates, and conjugating each coordinate by $C$ in the case of odd permutations (i.e. transpositions). This fact about outer automorphisms being $S_3$ is also called <strong>triality</strong>.</p>

<p>The set of all $L_a$s under one such automorphism gets turned into the set of all $B_a$s, and therefore the $L_a$s are just as much a generating set as  the $B_a$s are. Interestingly, if you restrict to pure imaginary $a$s, then $L_a^2=-1$ yields a representation of $\mathcal{C}\ell(\mathrm{Im}(\mathbb{O}))$ on $\mathbb{O}$, hence an action of $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ on $\mathbb{R}^8$. This doesn't match the usual action of it on $\mathbb{R}\oplus\mathbb{R}^7$ (corresponding to the $B_a$s since they generate reflections which preserve the real axis), this new action acts transitively on $S^7\subset\mathbb{O}$ (with point-stabilizer $G_2=\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{O})$). Using $R_a$s instead of $L_a$s gives yet a third representation of $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ on $\mathbb{R}^8$.</p>

<p>If we call these three representations $V_1,V_2,V_3$ then the aforementioned Moufang identity (dualized) tells us that the triality $V_1\otimes V_2\otimes V_3\to\mathbb{R}$ is a morphism of $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-reps, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the trivial rep. (Note that dualizing a map $A\otimes B\to C$ means having a corresponding map $A\to B^{\ast}\otimes C$ or vice-versa, and similarly for more spaces being tensored. An inner product is equivalent to an isomorphism $B\cong B^{\ast}$.)</p>

<p>Finally, since I always wondered, here is a way to think about how to deduce the Moufang identities from scratch. Suppose we've already established alternativity (which isn't too hard using the alternator) and that octonions are not associative. These cover all possible identities between three variables $a,b,c$ in which each variable only shows up once. But what about the next step, where there are four terms and one of the variables shows up twice? Write out all possible nonassociative monomials with two $a$s, a $b$ and a $c$.</p>

<p>With some quick detective work we can rule some out (from $\mathbb{O}$ being nonassociative), prove others (from $\mathbb{O}$ being alternative), and conclude many of them are equivalent (by conjugating equations and replacing variables with their conjugates). The resulting identities left to check are the Moufang identities (IIRC).</p>

<p>To check e.g. $(ab)(ca)=a(bc)a$, it's useful to invoke a series of reductions to simplify the problem: wlog $b$ is a unit imaginary, wlog $c$ is a unit imaginary, wlog $b$ and $c$ are orthogonal, decompose $a=a_{\|}+a_{\perp}$ with respect to the quaternionic subalgebra $\mathrm{span}\{1,b,c,bc\}$, wlog $a_{\perp}\ne0$, $a$ may be normalized so $|a_{\perp}|=1$ and therefore $\{b,c,a_{\perp}\}$ act like $\{i,j,\ell\}$ and a single check of $\mathbb{O}$s multiplication table (following from the Cayley-Dixson laws) is enough to finish.</p>

I think it's actually okay that there are some unknowns.</p>

<p>The reason is there are <em>many</em> possible $g(x,y)$ functions that will solve this problem, i.e. that will satisfy the condition that the resulting vector field is conservative.</p>

<p>You correctly stated that
$$ \frac{\der M}{\der y} = \frac{\der N}{\der x} $$
which simplifies to
$$ 3 = g_x $$
Integrating both sides with respect to $x$ yields
$$ g(x,y) = 3x + h(y) $$
where $h(y)$ is an arbitrary function.</p>

<p>At this point you might be tempted to try to somehow solve for $h(y)$ (I was, anyway), but it turns out this $h(y)$ is not something to <em>solve</em> for, it rather describes the form of all the possible $g(x,y)$ solutions: i.e. that as long as $g(x,y)$ has the form
$$ g(x,y) = 3x + h(y) $$
for some function $h(y)$, then $g$ is a valid solution to the problem. If you don't believe me, try plugging in the above expression for $g(x,y)$ and solving for the potential function $f$ of the vector field $\vec{\mathbf{F}}$ in terms of $h(y)$. You'll see that it doesn't matter what $h(y)$ is, we can always find $f$.</p>

"2389999","2390085","<p>As with Batting Averages, it gets tricky when there is rounding (which there usually is).  For example if $2$ out of $7$ vote for a certain thing, and the other $5$ vote against it,  then you'd have $28.571429\dots \%$ and $71.428571\dots\%$ which you would probably round to something like $28.57,\,71.43$.  But if you used those numbers you'd look at the fraction $\frac {2857}{10000}$ and, as that is in least terms, you'd deduce that you needed $10000$ voters.</p>

<p>One way to handle this is to use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Continued Fractions</a>.  For example, the Continued Fractions expansion for $\frac {2857}{10000}$ has the terms $[0;3,1,1,1428]$ and of course $\frac 27$ is one of the convergents.</p>

<p>To illustrate using your values: starting from $.296$ we'd look at the convergents to the continued fraction for $\frac {296}{1000}=\frac {37}{125}$.  They are:  $$\{0, \frac 13, \frac 27, \frac 3{10}, \frac {5}{17}, \frac {8}{27}, \frac {37}{125}\}$$</p>

"2390131","2390366","<p>Your ""compound"" process $M_Y$ at a <em>fixed</em> $t\ge 0$ is the composition of two mappings $\psi_t(\omega):=(\omega,Y_t(\omega))$ and $\varphi(\omega,u):=M_u(\omega)$. The former is an $\mathcal F / \mathcal F\otimes\mathcal B$ measurable mapping of $\Omega$ to $\Omega\times[0,\infty)$. (Where $\mathcal B$ denotes the Borel subsets of $[0,\infty)$.) This is because $\mathcal F\otimes\mathcal B$ is generated by rectangles of the form $F\times B$, $F\in\mathcal F, B\in\mathcal B$, and $\psi_t^{-1}(F\times B)=F\cap Y_t^{-1}(B)$.
To finish you need to know that the latter mapping $\varphi$ is $\mathcal F\otimes\mathcal B / \mathcal R$ measurable. (Here I use $\mathcal R$ to denote the Borel subsets of $\Bbb R$.) This situation is referred to as $M$ being a ""measurable process"" and is an additional hypothesis.

"2390203","2390297","<p>Here's a cubic polynomial to play with.
$$
f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 +cx +d.
$$</p>

<p>You want $d = f(0)$ to be the value of the bananas at the start.</p>

<p>You want the derivative of $f$ at $0$ to be $0$ so that the curve is flat there. That tells you $c=0$. </p>

<p>You want $f(t)=0$ for the known value of $t$ when the bananas are free. That gives you one linear equation relating the unknowns $a$ and $b$ and the known value of $d$:
$$
t^3a + t^2b + d = 0.
$$</p>

<p>You have one more thing you can specify. I thought about using the slope (steepness) at $t$. Call that $-k$ since you want a slope down to the right.</p>

<p>That tells you
$$
3t^2a + 2tb +k = 0.
$$</p>

<p>Now solve for $a$ and $b$:</p>

<p>$$
a = \frac{2d-kt}{t^3}
$$
$$
b =  \frac{kt-3d}{t^2}
$$
This is easy to play with in Excel. Then you can change the values of $d$, $t$ and $k$ and see what happens.</p>

<p>I put these into Excel with the values $d=10$, $t=12$ and $k=2$ and got this picture:</p>

<p>Warning: If you try with $k$ too large to get a steeper descent at $t$ then $b$ will become positive and $f(x)$ will become larger than $d$ for a while. That suggests that the best (steepest) value for $k$ is $3d/t$, which will make $b=0$. If I wanted to spend more time on this I'd just assume that from the start. I leave that to you.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In retrospect, this is much easier. (Often in mathematics you think ""that's obvious"" - but only after you solved the problem a hard way.)</p>

<p>Given the value $d$ when the bananas are new and the time $t$ when they're free, 
put the inflection point of the cubic at $x=0$:
$$
f(x) = ax^3 +d .

Then  $f(0) = d$. Setting $a = -d/t^3$ makes $f(t) = 0$.</p>

"2390271","2390315","<p>You have several problems with this question.  One is that replacing functions with values that are asymptotically equal is not justified.

Second, $\operatorname{li}(n)$ is a much better approximation to $\pi(n)$ than $\frac n{\ln (n)}$.  Skewes' number depends on the comparison between $\pi(n)$ and $\operatorname{li}(n)$.  $\frac n{\log n}$ is not involved.  Your final inequality is false for $n \gt 3.847$  Finally, you seem to expect that $10^{19}$ or Skewes' number is large enough for asymptotics to have taken hold.  It would not be hard to construct an example where this fails.  We could ask for what $n$ does $10^{-6}\log (\log(n))$ exceed $1$.

The direction vector of the line is $(4,-3,16)$, so the equation of the perpendicular plane through t is $$4x-3y+16z=4t_x-3t_y+16t_z.$$ Eliminate $\lambda$ from ${x+1\over4}={y+1\over-3}={z-15\over16}=\lambda$ to get a pair of linear equations that describe two planes that contain the line, e.g., $3x+4y+7=0$ and $4x-z+19=0$. The point $c$ lies at the intersection of these three planes, i.e., is the solution to the system of the three equations, which you can find using your favorite method. (Back-substitution might be reasonably fast here because two of the equations involve only two variables each.) Once you have $c$, use the formula from the beginning of this answer to compute $t'$.  </p>

<hr>

<p><a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2390821/265466"">Hardmath’s answer</a> reminded me of another geometric solution. From an equation of a line of the form ${x-x_0\over a}={y-y_0\over b}={z-z_0\over c}$, you can derive the parametric form $(x_0,y_0,z_0)+\lambda(a,b,c)$, or, more succinctly, $p_0+\lambda v$. The vector $v$ gives the direction of the line. As shown in your diagram, the point $c$ is the orthogonal projection of $t$ onto the line, which can be computed using a standard formula: $$c=p_0+{(t-p_0)\cdot d\over d\cdot d}d=p_0+{t\cdot d-p_0\cdot d\over d\cdot d}d.$$ The reflected point $t'$ is then obtained via the formula at top. Plugging in the values in your example, we have $$\begin{align}c &amp;= (-1,-1,15)+{4t_x-3t_y+16t_z-\left((-1)(2)+(-1)(-3)+(15)(16)\right)\over 4^2+(-3)^2+16^2}(4,-3,16) \\ &amp;=(-1,-1,15)+{4t_x-3t_y+16t_z-239\over16+9+256}(4,-3,16).\end{align}$$ The fraction in the second line should look familiar: it’s $\lambda$ from Hardmath’s answer.</p>

"2390406","2390435","<p>Riemann sums compute definite integrals.  You have asked for an antiderivative, an indefinite integral, so there is more to this than just computing the sum.  The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fundamental theorem of calculus</a> tells us two things.  The second is that for an integrable function $f$, having antiderivative $F$, $$\int_a^b f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x = F(b) - F(a)  \text{.}$$  Note that a given $f$ has infinitely many choices of $F$, all of which work.  (The theorem is actually a little more specific about intervals of definition.  All the functions we will encounter are sufficiently well behaved on the entire real line, so I have suppressed these details.)</p>

<p>You seem to have found that the definite integral $$\int_a^b 2x \,\mathrm{d}x = b^2 - a^2  \text{.}$$  Note that this is a function of $b$ minus a function of $a$ and both these functions are the ""square my input"" function, $F(x) = x^2$.  So by comparing terms in this particular definite integral with the result in the fundamental theorem, we find an antiderivative.  Since we have used a non-reductive step, we should check that our result is valid: $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} x^2 = 2x$, as desired.</p>

<p>But can we be a little more rigorous?  Yes.  The first part of the fundamental theorem tells us $$ F(x) = \int_a^x f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x  \text{.}$$  (The notation here is awful.  We have used ""$x$"" in both a bound and an unbound context.  To not write intentionally ambiguous expressions, we should write instead $ F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \,\mathrm{d}t $.  But more than a century of convention of misusing $x$ in both places means you should get used to seeing and parsing such expressions.)  But we've already done this calculation.  We were just unfortunate in calling the variable $x$ by the name ""$b$"" previously.  That is, $$F(x) = \int_a^x 2t \,\mathrm{d}t = x^2 - a^2  \text{.}$$  Note that we have recovered the $x^2$ as above, but have an additional ""${}-a^2$"".  But $a$ is some constant.  If we had chosen any other $a$, this would only translate the graph of $F$ vertically, which would change its derivative, $f$, not at all.  So we are free to make any choice of $a$ and we will get one of the many antiderivatives of $f$.  We could just as easily have written $F(x) = x^2 + C$ for $C = -a^2$.  While $C = -a^2$ is always non-positive for real $a$, the expression $x^2 + C$ is a valid antiderivative of $f$ for any choice of $C$ from the reals.  Consequently, a more general antiderivative of $f$ is the function $x^2 + C$.</p>

"2390409","2390432","<p>Let's look at the a more general case:  a function of the form $f(x^0 - |\mathbf{x}|)/|\mathbf{x}|$.  For the sake of compactness, I'll switch to spherical polar coordinates where $|\mathbf{x}| = r$.  We therefore have
$$
\begin{multline}
\left[\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^0}\right)^2 - \nabla^2 \right] \frac{f(x^0-|\mathbf{x}|)}{|\mathbf{x}|} \\= \frac{f''(x^0 - r)}{r} - f(x^0 - r) \nabla^2 \left( \frac{1}{r} \right) - \frac{1}{r} \nabla^2 f(x^0 - r) - 2 \left[ \nabla \left(\frac{1}{r}\right) \right] \cdot \left[\nabla (f(x^0 - r)) \right]
\end{multline}
$$In spherical coordinates, we have
$$
\frac{1}{r} \nabla^2 f(x^0 - r) = \frac{1}{r} \left[ \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r^2 \frac{\partial f(x^0 - r)}{\partial r} \right)  \right] = \frac{1}{r} f''(x^0 - r) - \frac{2}{r^2} f'(x^0 - r)
$$
and 
$$
2 \left[ \nabla \left(\frac{1}{r}\right) \right] \cdot \left[\nabla (f(x^0 - r)) \right] = 2 \left( - \frac{1}{r^2}  \hat{r} \right) \cdot \left( - f'(x^0 - r) \hat{r} \right) = \frac{2}{r^2} f'(x^0 - r).
$$
(If you wish to check these, note that
$$
\frac{\partial f(x^0 - r)}{\partial r} = - f'(x^0 - r) \qquad \frac{\partial^2 f(x^0 - r)}{\partial r^2} = f''(x^0 - r)
$$
due to the chain rule.) Putting all of these together, we find that
$$
\frac{f''(x^0 - r)}{r}  - \frac{1}{r} \nabla^2 f(x^0 - r) - 2 \left[ \nabla \left(\frac{1}{r}\right) \right] \cdot \left[\nabla (f(x^0 - r)) \right] = 0,
$$
and so for any function $f$, we have
$$
\left[\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^0}\right)^2 - \nabla^2 \right] \frac{f(x^0-|\mathbf{x}|)}{|\mathbf{x}|} = - f(x^0 - r) \nabla^2 \left( \frac{1}{r} \right) = 4 \pi f(x^0 - |\mathbf{x}|) \delta^3(\mathbf{x}).
$$
The above derivation works for any function of $x^0 - r$ alone, including $\delta(x^0 - r)$.</p>

<p>The reason this works for any function, by the way, is that the general solution for the wave equation in three dimensions under the assumption of spherical symmetry (and excluding the origin) is
$$
u(r, t) = \frac{1}{r} \left[ f(r - t) + g(r + t) \right]
$$

Thus we are seeking $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}$ when $(x,y) = (-1,1)$.  Via implicit differentiation, we obtain
\begin{align}
x^2 - xy + y - 3 = 0 &amp;\implies 2x - \left( x\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} + y\right) + \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = 0 \\

&amp;\implies \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}y} = \frac{y-2x}{1-x}.\tag{$\ast$}

Substituting the point $(x,y) = (-1,1)$ into ($\ast$), we conclude that
$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = \frac{1-2(-1)}{1-(-1)} = \frac{1+2}{1+1} = \frac{3}{2}. $$
This gives the slope of the tangent line.  To obtain the equation for the tangent line, remember that a line with slope $m$ passing through a point $(x_0,y_0)$ has equation
$$ y-y_0 = m(x-x_0).$$
Therefore an equation for the line tangent to the given curve through the point $(-1,1)$ is given by

"2390538","2390745","<p>For a different approach, choose $x\in X$ so that $X = \cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \overline B_x(n).$ Now consider, for fixed $n\in \mathbb N,$ the fact that the compact ball $\overline B_x(n)$ is totally bounded. This means that, for each $m\in \mathbb N$, there is a $\textit{finite}$ set of points $x_{m,n}\in \overline B_x(n)$ such that if $y\in \overline B_x(n)$ then there is an $m\in \mathbb N$ and $x_{m,n}$ such that $d(y,x_{m,n})&lt;1/m,$ which implies that $\left \{ x_{m,n} \right \}_{m\in \mathbb N}$ is a countable dense subset of $\overline B_x(n)$ and therefore that $\left \{ x_{m,n} \right \}_{m,n\in \mathbb N}$ is a countable dense subset of $X$.

$$A\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\ \vdots \\1\end{bmatrix}=((n-1)-x)\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\ \vdots \\1\end{bmatrix}.$$
Thus $(n-1)-x$ is an eigen value of $A$ so it divides the determinant. </p>

<p>Moreover we can think of $\text{det} A$ as an $n^{\text{th}}$ degree polynomial in $x$. An obvious root is $x=-1$ (because $\text{det} A\big|_{x=-1}=0$). Thus you have another factor of the determinant. </p>

<p>So far we have
$$\text{det} A=(x+1)(x-(n-1))p(x),$$

Let the measure space be $\Omega = \overline{\mathbb R}^\infty$, the map $f =$ left shift on $\Omega$, map $\psi : \Omega \to \overline{\mathbb R}$ selects the first coordinate.  The measure on $\Omega$ is made from the joint distributions of the random variables $\psi_n$.  In fact there is a canonical measure-preserving map $X \to \Omega$ onto a subset of (outer) measure $1$ by $x \mapsto (\psi_n)_n$.

"2390555","2390624","<p>I don't think there is any problem because $f$ has compact support: when $x\in K$, a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$, the function $y \mapsto f_{x_i x_j}(x-y)$ vanishes outside the compact set $K - \text{supp}(f)$. It means that
$$|\phi(y)f_{x_i x_j}(x-y)| \le |\phi(y)|\mathbb{1}_{K - \text{supp}(f)}(y) \|f_{x_i x_j}\|_\infty  \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$$

<p><strong>1.</strong> We are not told about which bag is which. This is an important point.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> For every pair there could be two possibilities. 1st color may come from 1994 bag or from 19996 bag. (x,y) or (y,x)</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> We don't know which color came from where. We have to find the numerical value for the possibility.</p>

<h1>Evaluating Sample Space</h1>

<p>There are six colors in each set and thus we have 36 different possibilities. 
Points 2 and 3 in the question do not matter because the order does not matter. </p>

<p>B1 x B2 =  (b1 from B1 and b2 from B2)
All colors are common in both bags except two, viz Tan and Blue.</p>

<p>Since Tan is only present in B1, only (Tan, b2) is possible similarly only (b1,Blue) is possible and not the reverse.</p>

<h1>Apply Conditional probability (Bayes' Theorem)</h1>

<p>The friend gave me a yellow and green M&amp;M and there are two ways of getting them. (Y,G) and (G,Y). I don't know which is from where. Since I am only looking for yellow from 1994 bag, there are two different events as to how bags can be chosen.</p>

<p><strong>E1</strong> = B1, the first bag from which first M&amp;M was drawn was 1994 bag and the other one was from 1996.</p>

<p><strong>E2</strong> = B1, the first bag from which first M&amp;M was drawn was 1996 bag and the other one was from 1994.</p>

<p>In addition let <strong>I</strong> be the event of us getting a yellow M&amp;M and a green M&amp;M irrespective of choice of bags.</p>

<p>Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem as below.</p>

<p>P(E1 | I ) = P(I ∣ E1).P(E1) / P(I)                       ......<strong>Eq (1)</strong></p>

<p>Evaluating P(I ∣ E1) we get .04
Evaluating P(E1) we get .5</p>

<p>The denominator of Eq. (1) is a harder than above ones.</p>

<p>P(I) = P(I ∩ (E1 ∪ E2))= P[(I ∩ E1) ∪ (I ∩ E2)] </p>

<p>= P[(I ∩ E1) ∪ (I ∩ E2)] = </p>

<p>= P (E1). P(I ∣ E1) + P (E2). P(I ∣ E2) </p>

<p>Now filling in the values here  : </p>

<p>= (1/2). (.04) + (1/2).(0.014)</p>

<p>= 0.027</p>

<p>The problem in your working occurs as the first line doesn't even imply the second line. When working with inequalities, you want to apply operations to both sides so that the inequality is preserved.</p>

<p>Taking the reciprocal of both sides does not preserve this (unlike for equalities). If you consider the graph of $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$, you'll see that for $a,b\in\Bbb R^*$, $a&lt;b$ implies $f(a)&lt;f(b)$ if $a$ and $b$ have different signs, and $f(a)&gt;f(b)$ if $b$ and $a$ have same signs.

"2390648","2390795","<p>In general, you want to determine the definiteness of a $n\times n$ matrix $A$ given vectors $\vec x$, $\vec b$ such that $A\vec x=\vec b$. Just to clarify, I'll define definiteness as follows:</p>

<p>$A$ is <em>positive definite</em> $\implies \vec x^tA\vec x&gt;0\ \forall \vec x\neq \vec 0$</p>

<p>$A$ is <em>negative definite</em> $\implies \vec x^tA\vec x&lt;0\ \forall \vec x\neq \vec 0$</p>

<p>$A$ is <em>positive semidefinite</em> $\implies \vec x^tA\vec x\ge 0\ \forall \vec x\neq \vec 0$</p>

<p>$A$ is <em>negative semidefinite</em> $\implies \vec x^tA\vec x\le0\ \forall \vec x\neq \vec 0$</p>

<p>$A$ is <em>indefinite</em> if none of the above are true.</p>

<p>Since $\vec x^TA\vec x=\vec x\cdot \vec b$, we can evaluate the above inequality once for each value for $\vec x$ and $\vec b$, but only one set of values is insufficient to completely determine the definiteness of $A$ (except in the one dimensional case). However, if $\vec x\cdot\vec b$ is a counterexample to any of the above inequalities, we can of course conclude that $A$ does not have the corresponding definiteness.</p>

<p>If we want to check the inequalities above for all $\vec x$, it's sufficient (and, in fact, necessary) to have a set of vectors that form a basis for the entire space, since we can write any $\vec x^tA\vec x$ in terms of this basis. The simplest way to do this is to completely determine $A$.</p>

<p>Suppose we know a linearly independent set $\{\vec x_1,\vec x_2,...,\vec x_n\}\subset\mathbb R^n$, as well as another set $\{\vec b_1,\vec b_2,...,\vec b_n\}\subset\mathbb R^n$, such that $A\vec x_i=\vec b_i\ \forall\ i$. We can then let $X$ and $B$ be matrices whose columns are $\vec x_i$ and $\vec b_i$ respectively, giving us the following matrix relation.</p>

<p>$$AX=B$$</p>

<p>Since $X$ has linearly independent columns, we know its inverse must exist. Thus we can compute $A$.</p>

<p>$$A=BX^{-1}$$</p>

<p>Definiteness is typically only discussed for Symmetric matrices, so if $A$ is not symmetric, it may be preferred to consider its symmetric part $A_{sym}=\frac 12(A+A^T)$, which defines the same quadratic form.</p>

<p>Once we know $A$ we can determine its definiteness several ways. One is to find all of its eigenvalues.

<p>So, let us do case $k=2$.</p>

s_1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; s_2

<p>which can easily be solved for eigenvalues of $A$. Notice that this works since symmetric matrices are diagonalizable by orthogonal matrix. Also both $A$ and $S$ get into Jordan form under same base change.</p>

<p>To address the issue of finding eigenvalues in higher dimensions.</p>

<p>Since we have $c\lambda_i+1 = s_i\prod\lambda_j$, we can see that $\frac{c\lambda_i+1}{s_i}$ is constant, let us denote it by $d$. So, we have $c\lambda_i+1 =s_id\implies \lambda_i =\frac{ds_i-1}{c}$. Finally, to find $d$, you need to solve $\prod\frac{ds_i-1}{c} = d$, which can be done for $k\leq 4$ by Abel-Ruffini theorem, otherwise you would have to do it numerically.</p>

"2390818","2390889","<p>Shortest paths on an arbitrary surface, called (<em>pre</em>-)<em>geodesics</em>, are difficult to describe explicitly in general. On a sphere (a good approximation to the surface of the earth as far as geodesy is concerned), however, they're arcs of great circles.</p>

<p>Generally, if a geodesic triangle on a surface encloses a topological disk $T$, if $\Theta$ denotes the total interior angle of $T$, and if $K$ denotes the Gaussian curvature function, then
$$
\iint_{T} K\, dA = \pi + \Theta.
$$
Particularly, if $K &gt; 0$, a geodesic triangle has interior angle greater than $\pi$, and if $K &lt; 0$, a geodesic triangle has interior angle less than $\pi$.</p>

<p>On a sphere of radius $R$, we have $K = 1/R^{2}$, so a geodesic triangle of area $A$ has total interior angle $\pi + A/R^{2}$. For instance, a triangle with three right angles (one-eighth of a sphere) has area $4\pi R^{2}/8$ and total interior angle $\frac{3}{2}\pi$.</p>

<p>Curvature can be observed in practice: Longitude lines are geodesics, while latitude lines (except the equator) are not. If a surveyor wants to lay off one-mile (near-)square plots, the plots will fit well east-to-west (because two latitude lines are separated by a constant distance), but not well north-to-south (because two longitude lines get closer the farther from the equator one travels). Consequently, at moderate latitudes, every several miles the north-south boundaries of square plots must ""jog"" east or west in order for the plots to remain approximately square. The photographs below (own work) show this phenomenon in the nearly-planar plains of eastern Texas, taken from a plane.</p>

"2390831","2390850","<p>It depends whether you think of the vector bundles as smooth vector bundles, or as holomorphic vector bundles. Short exact sequences of smooth vector bundles always split (see <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/691802/when-does-a-ses-of-vector-bundles-split"">here</a>).

<p>In general, the answer is no. For example, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_sequence"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Euler sequence</a> on $\mathbb{CP}^n$,
$$ 0 \to \mathcal O_{\mathbb P^n} \to \mathcal O_{\mathbb P^n}^{\oplus (n + 1)} \to \mathcal T_{\mathbb P^n} \to 0,$$

<p>The second part of your question is about locally free sheaves.

"2390852","2390873","<p>Your answer is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Euler Angles</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed, you could find more useful the Tait–Bryan angles, which express directly the angles $\psi$, $\theta$ and $\phi$ as the yaw, pitch and roll operation.</p>

<p>This standard sequence is denoted as $z-y'-x''$, meaning you first rotate in the $z$ axis, then in the $y$ axis, then in the $x$ axis, always with respect to your plane (intrinsic rotation). </p>

<p>From the reference article, the transformation matrix is:
$$
R=Z_1 Y_2 X_3 = \begin{bmatrix}
 c_1 c_2 &amp; c_1 s_2 s_3 - c_3 s_1 &amp; s_1 s_3 + c_1 c_3 s_2 \\

where $1,2,3$ are the $\psi$, $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the  yaw, pitch, roll angles; and  $c,s$ are the $\cos,\sin$ functions.</p>

<p>from there you can easily check that $[1;0;0]$ transforms into $R[1;0;0]=[c_2;c_2s_1;-s_2]$, which is the correct value after a yaw-pitch (roll do not affect this vector). </p>

"2390856","2390874","<p>The argument in (3) and (4) is incomplete. You go from ""the union of all these subgroups is all of $G$"" to concluding ""we must have found all the subgroups of order $p$,"" but don't explain why.</p>

<p>Indeed cardinality does not seem very relevant to me. Your idea of splitting subgroups of order $p$ into those of two types is a good one - it is an elementary version of the Schubert cell decomposition for projective spaces, $\mathbb{P}^n=\mathbb{A}^n\sqcup\mathbb{A}^{n-1}\sqcup\cdots\sqcup\mathbb{A}^1\sqcup\mathbb{A}^0$. (Don't worry about understanding that, I'm just saying your idea is one used in advanced math.)</p>

<p>To see that you've found every subgroup of order $p$, one can do so <em>directly</em>. Every such subgroup is cyclic, so generated by some $(a,b)$, and $\langle (a,b)\rangle$ is already in your list of found subgroups (with two cases depending on if $a=0$ or $a\ne0$).</p>

<hr>

<p>Here is another argument that works more generally but you may find too abstract.</p>

<p>The subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_p^2$ of size $p$ are cyclic, and this is a special case of counting $1$-dim subspaces of a vector space $V$ over a finite field $k$. Let $\mathbb{P}(V)$ be the collection of all $1$-dim subspaces of $V$ and write $V^{\times}$ for the subset of nonzero vectors in $V$. Every nonzero vector $v$ generated a $1$-dim subspace $\langle v\rangle=kv$, so there is a function $V^{\ast}\to \mathbb{P}(V)$ given by $v\mapsto\langle v\rangle$. Any fiber of this map is the set of nonzero vectors of a $1$-dim subspaces, of which there are $|k^{\times}|$-many. Therefore, the number of $1$-dim subspaces is $|V^{\times}|/|k^{\times}|$.</p>

<p>Explicitly, if $k=\mathbb{F}_q$ and $V=\mathbb{F}_q^n$ then this is $(q^n-1)/(q-1)=q^{n-1}+\cdots+q+1$ (which matches the decomposition $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}=\mathbb{A}^{n-1}\sqcup\cdots\sqcup\mathbb{A}^1\sqcup\mathbb{A}^0$).</p>

<p>This should not be surprising if you are familiar with group actions, since the $1$-dim subspaces minus the origin are precisely the orbits of $k^{\times}$ acting on $V^{\times}$ freely.</p>

"2390875","2391286","<p>The notation $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ in the statement of the theorem is just a name for an invertible sheaf which by hypothesis is very ample. The motivation of such a name is exactly the fact that a very ample invertible sheaf $L$, plus a choice of a basis of $\Gamma(X, L)$, where $X$ is a variety over some algebraically closed field, is the same as giving a closed immersion $i:X\hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n$ plus an isomorphism $\phi: L \simeq i^*\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(1)$. As you were suggesting, $\mathcal{O}_X(l)$ is a shorthand for $L^l$.</p>

<p>The isomorphism $\phi$ above shows that every very ample line bundle is isomorphic to $i^*\mathcal{O}(1)$, or $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ if you prefer this notation. Let me remark that there is not a canonically defined invertible sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ on $X$ as in the case of $\mathbb{P}^n$. In other terms, there is not a canonically defined very ample invertible sheaf $L$ on $X$. This is the same as saying that you can embed $X$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ in different ways, and it can be that the associated very ample line bundles $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ are one different from each other. </p>

<p>For example, think of a non hyperelliptic curve of genus 3. You have different embeddings given by $K$ and $2K$, where $K$ is the canonical line bundle. By embedding the curve using these two line bundles, you have that $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ will be isomorphic to $K$ in the first case and to $2K$ in the second one. You can also see this by looking at $X=\mathbb{P}^1$ : this is isomorphic both to $Proj(k[x,y])$ and $Proj(k[u,v,w]/(uw-v^2))$ , so that the $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ in the first case is the sheafification of the $k[x,y]$-module $k[x,y](1)$ , in the other case is the sheafification of $k[x,y](2)$. Clearly, in the case of the projective line you do have a canonical $\mathcal{O}(1)$ but this is a special case, and that's because you have a canonical embedding, if you want, of the projective line into a projective space, namely the identity (you can also see this by looking at the functorial definition of the projective line). But in general, you do not have such a canonical embedding.</p>

  <p>Let's say I draw a random curve (assuming it can be infinitely thin), can I find a proper function for it? Let the curve be continuous and with its domain of all real numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's two cases here. After you've drawn your curve (lets refer to your curve as $\Gamma_f$, for brevity's sake) in $\mathbb{R}^2$, attempt to find somewhere where can draw a vertical line that intersects your curve twice.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you found a vertical line that intersects $\Gamma_f$ twice, there is no such function.</li>
<li>If you are unable to find such a vertical line, then there exists a function.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's elaborate now. First, note that a function is a ""mapping"" from one set to another (in this case, it is from $\mathbb R \to \mathbb R$). Functions that go from $A \to B$ have one crucial requirement:
$$(\forall a \in A)(\exists ! b \in B) \qquad f(a)=b$$
in English, this translates to ""for every element $a$ in $A$, there's only one $b$ in $B$ such that $f(a)=b$"". That is, you can't have the element $a$ be mapped to two elements simultaneously, saying ""$f(a)=b_1, b_2$"" in this case is nonsensical. This is why if #1 was the case, then the curve $\Gamma_f$ does not correspond to a function.</p>

<p>Now let's look at the second case. Here, your curve $\Gamma_f$ corresponds to a function <em>because it fits the requirements</em>. Doesn't even need to be continuous, if you threw random dots all over the place <em>then $\Gamma_f$ still corresponds to a function</em>.</p>

<p>Now of course this function cannot be described with a polynomial if it is just a collection of points, you would have to describe it explicitly. For instance,
the mapping $\mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ defined by
$$f= \{ (1,1), \ (2, 5), \ (8,9) \}$$
<em>is a function.</em> We'd have $f(1)=1, f(2)=5,$ and $f(8)=9$. As for $f(25)$? That's undefined. Regardless, <em>$f$ is still a function.</em></p>

<p>And that is why if #2 is your case, then your curve $\Gamma_f$ corresponds to a function.</p>

"
"2390885","2390920","<p>At least for an intuitive approach as to why the answer sheet's answer is right, note that the line $y = 3x - 1$ has slope 3. Your equation parametrizes a line that has slope 1/3, since if you let $t$ vary from 0 to 1, say, $x$ varies from 0 to 3, while $y$ varies only from -1 to 0; this is a line of slop 1/3, not of slope 3.</p>

<p>The answer key equation gives a line that, as $t$ varies from 0 to 1 (say), has $x$ vary from 0 to 1 and $y$ vary from -1 to 2, which is the correct slope of 3.</p>

<p>The directional vector $d$ should be the slope vector; if the slope, for instance is 3 (as it is in this case), any vector that has slope 3 will do. So just pick the vector 
$$
d = \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ 
3
\end{pmatrix}.
$$</p>

<p>As for the -1, note that at $x = 0$, we have $y = 3\cdot 0 - 1 = -1$. This is captured in the vector form of the equation by the <em>initial position</em> vector 
$$
p = \begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 
-1
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
Because look what happens when we put $t = 0$ in the vector equation; we get $(x, y) = (0, -1) + 0\cdot d = (0, -1)$, meaning that the point $(0, -1)$ is on our line, as it should be. Really, it just serves as a convenient starting point to draw the vector equation line from. </p>
"
"2390893","2394303","<p>The difference here is whether you want to study the geometry of the zero locus of a polynomial, or the polynomial itself. The first case corresponds to ""classical"" algebraic geometry, which is the study of varieties and algebraic curves and so on, while the second belongs more to the theory of schemes.</p>

<p>Beginning with a set of points $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, we can ask various geometric questions about smoothness and dimension and so on. From the algebraic perspective, we want to represent $S = \{(0, y) \mid y \in \mathbb{R}\}$ as the zero locus of some collection of polynomials in $\mathbb{R}[x, y]$. As you've noticed, there are many ways of doing this, for example the polynomials $x$, $x^2$, $x(x^2 + 1)(y^2+1)$ all have the correct zero sets.</p>

<p>Here $(x)$ is the correct ideal to study for various reasons, which in this case basically boil down the the fact that $x$ cannot be factored. In general, you can define the ideal
$$ I(S) = \{f \in \mathbb{R}[x, y] \mid f(s) = 0 \text{ for all } s \in S\}$$
and then find generators of the ideal. In our example, it can be shown that $I(S) = (x)$, and since the generator $x$ is irreducible, it will enjoy various nice properties, such as the fact that smoothness of $S$ will make sense in terms of the Jacobian of $f(x, y) = x$, and so on.</p>

<p>Classic algebraic geometry always puts sets of points through the $I$ function to get the ""right"" polynomials cutting out the set $S$, and then proves theorems about dimension and smoothness using the output of $I$. This stops silly equations like $x(x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1)$ being used in place of the more simple $x$.</p>

<p>So that is one way of handling the ""problem"". The other is to use scheme theory, which regards the geometry cut out by $x = 0$ to be different to the geometry cut out by $x^2 = 0$. Schemes will notice that the difference between the intersection of two lines, and a line with a curve which is tangent at a point, since this is much like the difference between $x=0$ and $x^2 = 0$. However, the price you pay is that the theory is much more involved, and you need much more structure than a set of points sitting in a space.</p>

"2391038","2391062","<p>If the equation is $y'(x) = P(x, y(x))$ where $P$ is a polynomial and the approximations are defined by $y_0(x) = y(0)$ and</p>

<p>$$y_n(x) = y(0) + \int_0^x P(t, y_{n-1}(t)) dt$$</p>

<p>then, by induction $y_n(x)$ is a polynomial and its terms up to degree $n$ are equal to the Taylor coefficients of the solution at $0$ (but not necessarily the terms of degree $&gt; n$). Indeed the approximation formula above implies that the term of degree $k$ in $y_n$ depends only or the terms of degrees $1, \cdots, k-1$ in $y_{n-1}$. It means that the term of degree $k$ is stationary for all $n \ge k$. In particular, it is the term of the Taylor series because we know that a solution exists in an interval around $0$ and that this solution is $\mathcal{C}^\infty$.</p>

<p>In your case, the solution is
$$y(x) = \frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots$$
The $y_2$ approximation has Taylor terms $1+x+x^2$ but the term in $x^3$ will only be equal to the Taylor coefficient in $y_3$.</p>

<p>Edit: <strong>A more detailed proof by induction</strong> (on John Ma's request)</p>

<p>If $q$ is any polynomial, let us denote $D_k(q)$ its coefficient of degree $k$. Let us consider the polynomial</p>

<p>$$r(x) = y(0)+ \int_0^x P(t, q(t)) dt$$
Then $D_k(r)$ depends only on the terms of degree $&lt; k$ in $q$. It means that there is a function $F_k$ such that
$$D_k(r) = F_k(D_0(q),\ldots,D_{k-1}(q))$$
The approximations $y_n$ above are polynomials that satisfy
$$D_k(y_{n+1}) = F_k(D_0(y_n),\ldots,D_{k-1}(y_n))$$
Our induction hypothesis $\cal{H}_n$ is that $\forall i\le n$, $D_i(y_n) = D_i(y_i)$.</p>

<p>Obviously, $\cal{H}_0$ is true because the term of degree $0$ in all the $y_n$'s is $y(0)$. Supposing that $\cal{H}_n$ is true, then for all $i\le n+1$, one has
$$D_i(y_{n+1}) = F_i(D_0(y_n),\ldots,D_{i-1}(y_n))
= F_i(D_0(y_0),\ldots,D_{i-1}(y_{i-1})) = D_i(y_i)$$
which proves that $\cal{H}_n \Rightarrow \cal{H}_{n+1}$.</p>

<p>Hence, $D_i(y_n)$ does not depend on $n$ when $n \ge i$. One last question remains: why is this term equal to the Taylor series term of degree $i$ in the solution? For this, let $T_k(x)$ be the Taylor polynomial up to order $k$ in the solution. One can write $y(x) = T_k(x) + x^k \epsilon(x)$ where $\epsilon(x)\to 0$ when $\epsilon \to 0$. By using
$$T_k(x) + x^k \epsilon(x) = y(0) + \int_0^x P(t, T_k(t) + t^k \epsilon(t)) dt$$ it is easy to see that the coefficients of $T_k$ must satisfy
$D_i(T_k) = F_i(D_0(T_k),\ldots,D_{i-1}(T_k))$
when $i\le k$. It follows easily that the coefficients of $T_k$ must be the same as the coefficients given by the approximation process.</p>

<p>And we want $\frac{\sum \limits_{p|j} p-1}{j}$ to be as big as possible.</p>

<p>$j=p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots $ to be composite must have at least 2 distinct prime numbers or a prime raised to a power bigger than 1.</p>

<p>Now we will deal with $j= p_1 p_2 \cdots $ with out powers because $\frac{p_1+p_2+ \cdots}{p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots} \leq \frac{p_1+p_2 +\cdots}{p_1 p_2 \cdots}$ which is easy to see.</p>

<p>Now for the first case $j=p_1 p_2$ so $\frac{\sum \limits_{p|j} p-1}{j} = \frac{p_1+p_2}{p_1 p_2}$ and its maximum value is $\frac{5}{6}$ (Why ?)</p>

<p>We have $\frac{p_1 +p_2}{p_1 p_2} \leq \frac{5}{6}$ so $6p_1+6p_2 \leq 5p_1 p_2$ divide by $p_1 p_2$ we get $\frac{6}{p_2}+\frac{6}{p_1} \leq 5$ since $p_1 \geq 2$ and $p_2 \geq 3$ so $\frac{6}{p_2}+\frac{6}{p_1} \leq \frac{6}{3}+\frac{6}{2} = 5 \leq 5$.</p>

<p>For the second case $j =p_1 p_2 p_3$ so $\frac{\sum \limits_{p|j} p-1}{j} = \frac{p_1+p_2+p_3}{p_1 p_2 p_3}$</p>

<p>We want to prove that $\frac{p_1+p_2 +p_3}{p_1 p_2 p_3} \leq \frac{p_1 +p_2}{p_1 p_2}$ multiply by $p_1 p_2 p_3$ we get that $p_1+p_2+p_3 \leq (p_1+p_2)p_3$ divide by $(p_1+p_2)p_3$ we get that $\frac{1}{p_3} +\frac{1}{p_1+p_2} \leq 1$ and since $p_1 \geq 2$ and $p_2 \geq 3 $ and $p_3 \geq 5$ so we get that  $\frac{1}{p_3} +\frac{1}{p_1+p_2}\leq \frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{2+3} =\frac{2}{5} \leq 1$. </p>

<p>For the third case $j =p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ so $\frac{\sum \limits_{p|j} p-1}{j} = \frac{p_1+p_2+p_3+p_4}{p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4}$</p>

<p>We want to prove that $\frac{p_1+p_2 +p_3+p_4}{p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4} \leq \frac{p_1 +p_2}{p_1 p_2}$ multiply by $p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ we get that $p_1+p_2+p_3+p_4 \leq (p_1+p_2)p_3 p_4$ divide by $(p_1+p_2)p_3 p_4$ we get that $\frac{1}{p_3 p_4} +\frac{1}{(p_1+p_2) p_4} \frac{1}{(p_1+p_2)p_3} \leq 1$ and since $p_1 \geq 2$ and $p_2 \geq 3 $ and $p_3 \geq 5$ and $p_4 \geq 7$ so we get that  $\frac{1}{p_3 p_4} +\frac{1}{(p_1+p_2)p_3}+\frac{1}{(p_1+p_2)p_4}\leq \frac{1}{5*7}+\frac{1}{(2+3)*5} +\frac{1}{(2+3)*7} =\frac{17}{175}  \leq 1$. </p>

<p>For the general case $j = p_1 p_2 p_3 \cdots p_k$ so $\frac{\sum \limits_{p|j} p-1}{j} = \frac{p_1 +p_2 +p_3 + \cdots +p_k}{p_1 p_2 p_3 \cdots p_k}$</p>

<p>We want to prove that $\frac{p_1 +p_2 +p_3 + \cdots +p_k}{p_1 p_2 p_3 \cdots p_k} \leq \frac{p_1+p_2}{p_1 p_2}$ multiply by $p_1 p_2 p_3 \cdots p_k$ we get that $p_1 +p_2 +p_3 +\cdots +p_k \leq (p_1+p_2)p_3 p_4 \cdots p_{k-1} p_k$.</p>

<p>its easy to see that $p_1 +p_2 +p_3 +\cdots +p_k  \leq (k-1)p_k$, so $p_1 +p_2 +p_3 +\cdots +p_k \leq (k-1) p_k \leq (p_1+p_2)p_3 p_4 \cdots p_{k-1} p_k$. since $p_1 +p_2 \geq 5$ we get that $(k-1)p_k \leq 5 p_3 \cdots p_{k-1}p_k$.</p>

<p>its also easy to see that $p_3 \cdots p_{k-1} p_k \geq p_{k-1}p_k$ since all primes are bigger than $1$. so we get that $(k-1)p_k\leq 5 p_{k-1}p_k \leq 5 p_3 \cdots p_{k-1}p_k$.</p>

<p>divide by $5p_{k-1}p_k$ we get that $\frac{(k-1)p_k}{5p_{k-1}p_k} \leq 1$ from that we arrive at $\frac{k-1}{5p_{k-1}}$ we know from PNT that $p_{k-1} \geq (k-1) \ln{(k-1)}$ so we get that $\frac{k-1}{5 (k-1) \ln(k-1)} \leq \frac{k-1}{5(k-1)} = \frac{1}{5} \leq 1$, concluding that the <strong>maximum value for $\frac{\sum \limits_{p|j} p-1}{j}$ is $\frac{5}{6}$</strong>.</p>

<p>So $\displaystyle{\sum \limits_{c \leq n} \left(\frac{1}{j}+\frac{\sum \limits_{p|j} p-1}{j}\right)^{-1} \geq \sum \limits_{c \leq n} \left(\frac{1}{j}+\frac{5}{6}\right)^{-1} }$</p>

<p>And $\displaystyle{ \sum \limits_{c \leq n} \left(\frac{1}{j}+\frac{5}{6}\right)^{-1} } \geq \displaystyle{ \sum \limits_{c \leq n} \left(\frac{6}{7}\right)^{-1} }$ for all $j\geq 42$.</p>

<p>$ \displaystyle{ \sum \limits_{c \leq n} \left(\frac{6}{7}\right)^{-1}= \sum \limits_{c \leq n} \left(\frac{7}{6}\right) = \sum \limits_{k=1}^{n} \left(\frac{7}{6}\right)  -\sum \limits_{ p\leq n} \left(\frac{7}{6}\right)= \frac{7}{6}n-\frac{7}{6} \pi(n) \geq \frac{7}{6} n - \frac{7}{6} \frac{2n}{\ln n}  }  $ </p>

<p>We want to prove that $\frac{7}{6}n -\frac{7}{6} \frac{2n}{\ln n} &gt;n $ divide by $n$ we get that $\frac{7}{6}-\frac{7}{6}*\frac{2}{\ln n} &gt;1$ we arrive at $\frac{1}{6} &gt; \frac{14}{6 \ln n}$ so we arrive at $\ln n &gt;14$ and this is true for all $n \geq 1202605$.</p>

<p>Note : $\pi(n)$ is the prime counting function and by the PNT its asymptotic to $\frac{n}{\ln n}$ and proven to be smaller than $\frac{2n}{\ln n}$ for all $n\geq 2$.</p>

"
"2391066","2391119","<p>My initial idea would be to exploit a function like
$$ g(z) = \frac{f(z)}{\sin z}.$$
What is nice about $g(z)$ is that it is <em>holomorphic</em>, and it is holomorphic <em>everywhere</em>. It is true that $1 / \sin z$ has poles at $z = k\pi$ for $k \in \mathbb N$, but these poles are cancelled out by the zeroes of $f(z)$ in the numerator.</p>

<p>Our ultimate goal is to prove that $g(z) = 1$. Having established that $g(z)$ is holomorphic, we can try to show that $g(z) = 1$ using familiar theorems about holomorphic functions such as the maximum modulus principle and Liouville's theorem.</p>

<p>First, let us obtain a bound on $|g(x + iy)|$. Assuming I did my algebra correctly, we have an inequality:
$$|g(x + iy)| \leq \frac{e^{|y|}}{|\sin(x + iy)|}=\frac{\sqrt{2}e^{|y|}}{\sqrt{\cosh 2y - \cos 2x}}$$
Notice that this inequality is not uniformly useful! For example, at $x + iy = 0$, the expression on the right-hand side is infinite, so the inequality tells us nothing useful at $x + iy = 0$. However, there are some special contours within the complex plane where the expression on the RHS is not only useful for bounding $|g(x + iy)|$, but also easy to analyse:</p>

<ul>
<li>On vertical lines of the form $x = (N + \frac 1 2) \pi$ where $N \in \mathbb N$, the $\cos 2x$ term vanishes. It is easy to see that the expression on the RHS is bounded by $2$.</li>
<li>On horizontal lines of the form $y = M$ where $|M| \gg 0$, we can approximate $\cosh 2y$ by $e^{2|y|}$. The expression on the RHS is bounded by $2 / \sqrt{1 - 2e^{-2|M|}}$, which tends to $2$ as $M \to \infty$.</li>
</ul>

<p>The maximum modulus theorem allows us to use our knowledge about $|g(x + iy)|$ on these special contours to bound $|g(x + iy)|$ in other places. Let us define the rectangular domain
$$D_{N, M} =\{x + iy \in \mathbb C \ : -(N+\tfrac 1 2)\pi \leq x \leq (N + \tfrac 1 2)\pi, \ -M \leq y \leq M \},$$ for arbitrary $ N \in \mathbb Z,$ $M \gg 0.$ Using our above observations about the behaviour of $|g(x + iy)|$ on the boundary of this rectangular domain, the maximum modulus principle tells us that
$$ z \in D_{N,M} \implies |g(z)| \leq \frac{2}{\sqrt{1 - 2 e^{-2M}}} \ .$$
And since any $z \in \mathbb C$ is contained in $D_{N,M}$ for sufficiently large $N$ and $M$, we have
$$ z \in \mathbb C \implies |g(z)| \leq 2 \ .$$</p>

<p>Having shown that $|g(z)| \leq 2$, Liouville tells us that $g(z)$ is constant, i.e. that $f(z) = C \sin z$ for some $C \in \mathbb C$. We can fix the value of $C$ to be $1$ using the fact that $f'(0) = 1$, and this completes the proof.</p>

<p>As @lab bhattacharjee suggested, we may also arrange the equation with $y$ as the subject. </p>

<p>$$y^2-(1+x)y+(2x+4)=0\tag1$$</p>

<p>For integer $y$, we must have some integer $z$ such that
$$\Delta=z^2=(1+x)^2-4(2x+4)=x^2-6x-15=(x-3)^2-24$$
$$\iff(x-3-z)(x-3+z)=24$$</p>

<p>So there exists some integer $a=x-3-z$ and $\frac{24}{a}=x-3+z$.</p>

<p>Thus we have $$a+\frac{24}a=2x-6\iff x=\frac a2+\frac{12}a+3$$</p>

<p>So $a=2,4,6,12\iff x=8,10$. Substitute both values of $x$ into $(1)$ and we get</p>

"2391106","2391117","<p>Row and columns are described algebraically by multiplying by invertible matrices.</p>

<p>You are looking for solutions to the equation $(A - I) v = 0$. The specific form of the matrix doesn't matter, so let's just consider the general problem of solving $Bv = 0$.</p>

<p>Row operations are nice for this, because they multiply on the <em>left</em>: if $E$ encodes the row operation, then applying it to the matrix $B$ gives the matrix $EB$.</p>

<p>We can make $EB$ appear in the equation simply by multiplying $Bv = 0$ on the left by $E$ to get $EBv = 0$.</p>

<p>So, that's why you are taught to use row operations to solve systems of linear equations!</p>

<p>Column operations multiply on the right; unfortunately it's harder to make $BE$ appear in the equation: the simplest way to do so is that $Bv = 0$ is equivalent to the equation $(BE) (E^{-1} v) = 0$</p>

<p>So, you <em>can</em> make using column operations work. The trick, through, is that once you've found the solutions to $(BE) x = 0$, the solutions you were <em>actually</em> looking for are those with $E^{-1} v = x$, or equivalently, $v = Ex$.</p>

<p>In other words, once you get the solution, you have to take all of the column operations you applied and correctly reinterpret them as column operations to be applied (in reverse order!) to the solution vectors.</p>

<p>In your example, this means after obtaining the solution you got to the column-modified matrix, you need to swap the first and third rows of the solution vectors to get the solution to the original system. (both operations are represented by the same elementary matrix, which is why this is the correct operation to do)</p>

<p>This is tricky, and (IMO) doesn't really offer any benefit; the usual method taught for solving systems of equations has no problem just doing row operations here, to compute</p>

<p>$$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;0&amp;1\\0 &amp;0&amp;1\\0 &amp;0&amp;1\\\end{pmatrix} 
\to\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;0&amp;1\\0 &amp;0&amp;0\\0 &amp;0&amp;0\\\end{pmatrix}  $$</p>

"2391157","2392920","<p>First of all in this risk model you are collecting a continuous of income, so your surplus is keep increasing when there is no claim. Before the first claim happen, the surplus at time $t$ is $u + ct$. </p>

<p>If you require the maximum surplus never exceed $b$, then you essentially require the first claim must be early enough such that the surplus will not exceed $b$, so at the time when the first claim happen, we have the surplus $u + cW_1$ and we require</p>

<p>Otherwise, the ruin is not happen yet and the immediate surplus after claim is $u + cW_1 - X_1$. By the markov property, it is just like we start over again with the new initial surplus $u + cW_1 - X_1$. And this is just the first integral in the RHS.</p>

"2391163","2391204","<p>As you present it you're right: You <em>can</em> just set
$$ \phi(s,p) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{if $s=p$ and $s$ has at least four prime factors} \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

<p>If that is <em>not</em> a sufficient answer, it must be because there are additional conditions of $\phi$ that you have not reproduced in your question. What they might be is anyone's guess, though.</p>

<p>It is common to require that $\phi$ is <em>computable</em>, but that is obviously the case here -- we can easily check whether $s$ equals $p$, and we can also compute the prime factorization of $s$ and sum the exponents.</p>

One hypothesis could be that the textbook you get the exercise from might want to be able to verify proofs in <em>polynomial time</em>, in which case the above function won't do unless $s$ is given in unary notation.

"2391176","2395502","<p>Say we have two points $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$, then the condition of one point seeing the other is equivalent to the condition that
$$\gcd (x_2-x_1, y_2-y_1) = \pm 1$$
(The $\pm$ comes from the fact that one of the differences might be negative, but this is not essential)
Lets call this the ""distance"" between points $P_1$ and $P_2$ and write it down as $|P_2 - P_1| = \gcd (x_2-x_1, y_2-y_1)$</p>

<p>Let us show a construction that produces a loop of size $n+2$ (for arbitrary $n$, for example, $n=98$).
First let us create $n+1$ points:
$$A_0 = (0, 0); A_1 = (a, b); A_2 = (2a, 2b) \dots A_n = (na, nb)$$
Where $a$ and $b$ are arbitrary numbers on which we impose simply that $\gcd (a, b) = \pm 1$. Notice that the points all lie on one straight line.
This implies that each of the points $A_1, A_2 \dots A_{n-1}$ sees exactly two others, while $A_0$ and $A_n$ see exactly one other point.</p>

<p>(The gcd condition makes it so that there are no points between $A_i$ and $A_{i+1}$, since then 
$$|P_{i+1} - P_i|= \gcd (a\cdot(i+1)-a \cdot i, b \cdot (i+1)-b \cdot i) = \gcd (a, b) = \pm 1$$
And it is clear that two points that have a point in between them cannot see each other from definition, thus any single point on this line can see no more than two others.)</p>

<p>Now all that is left is to find the coordinates of a point $B = (c, d)$ such that $B$ sees $A_0$ and $A_n$ and does not see any other point. So in essence this boils down to the following system:
$$|B-A_0| = \gcd(c-0, d-0) = \gcd(c, d) = \pm 1$$
$$|B-A_i| = \gcd(c-ia, d-ib) \neq \pm 1 $$
$$|B-A_n| = \gcd(c-na, d-nb) = \pm 1$$
where the middle equation has to be satisfied for all $0&lt;i&lt;n$. Now since we have freedom over what exactly is the $|B-A_i|$ for these $i$ then we will require that 
$$\gcd(c-ia, d-ib) = d-ib \neq \pm 1$$
This in essence means simply that 
$$c-ia \equiv 0 \mod d-ib$$
$$c \equiv ia \mod d-ib$$</p>

<p>This is starting to look like the chinese remainder theorem now, isnt it?
For $|B-A_0|$ we will simply ask that 
$$ c \equiv 1 \mod d$$
(it is not hard to verify that this means that $\gcd(c, d) = 1$)
And for $|B-A_n|$ let us require that
$$ c \equiv na+1 \mod d - nb$$</p>

<p>So we have translated our $\gcd$ requirements into a system of congruences:
$$ c \equiv 1 \mod d$$
$$ c \equiv ia \mod d - ib$$
$$ c \equiv na+1 \mod d - nb$$
The chinese remainder theorem guarantees the existence of such a $c$. However, we must first establish that all of the modulus are pairwise coprime.</p>

<p>Notice that $d, d-b, d-2b \dots d-nb$ form an arithmetic progression. Now by the well known <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%E2%80%93Tao_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Green-Tao theorem</a> there exists an arithmetic progression of $k$ terms consisting only of primes for any $k$. So we choose $k=n+1$ and take the corresponding $d$ and $-b$ to be the first member of the sequence and difference respectively. Thus all of $d, d-b, d-2b \dots d-nb$ are now primes and are obviously coprime to one another.</p>

<p>Obviously it is possible to choose $a$ such that $\gcd(a,b) = 1$. And the existence of $c$ is guaranteed by the chinese remainder theorem.</p>

K(k) &amp;= \int_{0}^{\pi/2}\frac{dx}{\sqrt{1 - k^{2}\cos^{2}x}}\notag\\
&amp;= \int_{0}^{\pi/2}\frac{dx}{\sqrt{1 - k^{2} + k^{2}\sin^{2}x}}\notag\\
&amp;=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{dt}{\sqrt{(1 - t^{2})(1 - k^{2} + k^{2}t^{2})}}\notag\\
\end{align}
Putting $k = a/\sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}$ we can see that $$K\left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}}\right) = \sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{dt}{\sqrt{(1 - t^{2})(b^{2} + a^{2}t^{2})}}$$ and using substitution $x = at$ we  get the link between $(1)$ and $(2)$.</p>

<p>Next we use the substitution $x = (1/t) - a$ in $(1)$ to get $$I(a, b) = \int_{1/2a}^{\infty}\frac{dt}{\sqrt{(2at - 1)((a^{2} + b^{2})t^{2} - 2at + 1)}}$$ The expression in square root can be expressed as $$2a(a^{2} + b^{2})t^{3} - (5a^{2} + b^{2})t^{2} + 4at - 1$$ and using the substitution $$t = x + \frac{5a^{2} + b^{2}}{6a(a^{2} + b^{2})}$$ the integral is transformed into $$I(a, b) = \int_{e}^{\infty}\frac{dx}{\sqrt{4x^{3} - g_{2}x - g_{3}}}\tag{3}$$ where $$g_{2} = \frac{(a^{2} - b^{2})^{2}}{12} - a^{2}b^{2},\, g_{3} = -\frac{(a^{2} - b^{2})\{(a^{2} - b^{2})^{2} + 36a^{2}b^{2}\}}{216}\tag{4}$$ and $e$ is the root of the cubic equation $4x^{3} - g_{2}x - g_{3} = 0$.</p>

<p>Next step is to put $g_{2} = 0$ so that $12a^{2}b^{2} = (a^{2} - b^{2})^{2}$ which gives $$a^{2} - b^{2} = -3(2g_{3})^{1/3}, a^{2} + b^{2} = 2\sqrt{3}(2|g_{3}|)^{1/3}\tag{5}$$ For our case we need to set $g_{3} = 1/2$ so that the root $e = 1/2$ and then we have $$a^{2} + b^{2} = 2\sqrt{3}, a^{2} - b^{2} = -3$$ so that $$\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{2\sqrt{2}} = \sin(\pi/12)$$ From $(1), (2), (3)$ and above values of $a, b$ it follows that $$K(k) = \frac{3^{1/4}}{2}\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^{3} - 1}}$$ And putting $x^{3} = 1/t$ we get $$K(k) = \frac{3^{1/4}}{6}\int_{0}^{1}t^{-5/6}(1 - t)^{-1/2}\,dt = \frac{3^{1/4}}{6}\frac{\Gamma(1/6)\Gamma(1/2)}{\Gamma(2/3)}$$ This can be expressed in terms of $\Gamma(1/3)$ only (via duplication and reflection formulas) to give the desired form.</p>

<hr>

<p>I must say that the above solution is totally non-obvious and without the hints in the exercise it does not appear possible to arrive at this solution. The value of $K(\sin(\pi/12))$ was first obtained by Legendre using a similar non-obvious approach.</p>

<hr>

<p>Borwein's book provides the evaluation of $K(\tan(\pi/8))$ as an exercise in a later chapter. But this is based on the representation of $2K(k)/\pi$ as the hypergeometric function ${}_{2}F_{1}(1/2,1/2;1;k^{2})$. To simplify typing we will use $F$ instead of ${}_{2}F_{1}$ in what follows.</p>

<p>The following two hypergeometric transformations are needed to create the magic
\begin{align}
&amp;F(a, b; a - b + 1; x)\notag\\
&amp;\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,= (1 - x)^{1 - 2b}(1 + x)^{2b - a - 1}F\left(\frac{a - 2b + 1}{2}, \frac{a - 2b + 2}{2}; a - b + 1; \frac{4x}{(1 + x)^{2}}\right)\tag{6}
\end{align}
and $$F\left(a, b; a + b + \frac{1}{2}; 4x(1 - x)\right) = F\left(2a, 2b; a + b + \frac{1}{2}; x\right)\tag{7}$$ Equation $(7)$ is by Kummer and <a href=""http://paramanands.blogspot.com/2011/10/elementary-approach-to-modular-equations-hypergeometric-series-2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">proved here</a>. Equation $(6)$ can be proved in a similar manner but with more difficulty. We start with the equation $$\frac{2K}{\pi} = F\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2};1;k^{2}\right)$$ and put $a=b=1/2, x = k^{2}$ in $(6)$ to get $$\frac{2K}{\pi}=(1 + k^{2})^{-1/2}F\left(\frac{1}{4},\frac{3}{4};1;\frac{4k^{2}}{(1 + k^{2})^{2}}\right)$$ Using $a = 1/8, b = 3/8, x = 4k^{2}/(1 + k^{2})^{2}$ in $(7)$ we get $$\frac{2K}{\pi}=(1 + k^{2})^{-1/2}F\left(\frac{1}{8},\frac{3}{8};1; X\right)\tag{8}$$ where $$X = 4x(1 - x) = \frac{16k^{2}(1 - k^{2})^{2}}{(1 + k^{2})^{4}} = \left(\frac{4kk'^{2}}{(1 + k^{2})^{2}}\right)^{2}$$ It's time to put $k = \tan(\pi/8) = \sqrt{2} - 1$ to get $X = 1$ (check this!). And thus we finally get $$K(\tan(\pi/8)) = \frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{4 - 2\sqrt{2}}}F(1/8, 3/8;1;1)$$ And then we use the formula $$F(a,b;c;1) = \frac{\Gamma(c)\Gamma(c - a - b)}{\Gamma(c - a)\Gamma(c - b)}\tag{9}$$ to get $$K(\tan(\pi/8)) = \frac{\sqrt{\sqrt{2} + 1}\pi}{2^{7/4}}\cdot\frac{\Gamma(1/2)}{\Gamma(7/8)\Gamma(5/8)}$$ which simplifies to the given form using the reflection formula and $\Gamma(1/2) = \sqrt{\pi}$.</p>

<hr>

<p>The transformation $(6)$ is non-obvious and it is used by Borwein brothers to link Ramanujan's alternative theory of theta functions (those dealing with $F(1/4, 3/4;1; x)$) with the standard theory (dealing with $F(1/2, 1/2;1;x)$). This is a key step in Borwein's proof of Ramanujan's famous series for $1/\pi$ and this particular development is well covered in <a href=""http://paramanands.blogspot.com/2012/03/modular-equations-and-approximations-to-pi-part-3.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my blog post</a>.</p>

"2391281","2392557","<p>Let's follow <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_exponential_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> and define the 2-adic (Iwasawa) logarithm on $\Bbb{Q}_2^*$ as follows. Recall that the group $\Bbb{Q}_2^*$ is a direct product
$$
\Bbb{Q}_2^*=\langle 2\rangle\times(1+2\Bbb{Z}_2).
$$
The usual Taylor series of $\log(1+x)$ familiar from calculus
$$
x-\frac{x^2}2+\frac{x^3}3-\frac{x^4}4+\cdots=\sum_{n=1}^\infty(-1)^{n+1}\frac{x^n}n
$$
converges w.r.t. the 2-adic topology whenever $x\in2\Bbb{Z}_2$. This is because for all $n$ we have $\nu_2(x^n)=n\nu_2(x)\ge n$ but we easily see that $\nu_2(n)\le n/2$. Therefore the general term $x^n/n\to0$ which is sufficient for convergence in a complete non-archimedean case. We can thus use this series and define
$$
\log(1+x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty(-1)^{n+1}\frac{x^n}n
$$
whenever $x\in 2\Bbb{Z}_2$. The familiar power series identities then show that the rule $$\log(xy)=\log x+\log y\qquad(*)$$ holds whenever $x,y\in1+2\Bbb{Z}_2$.
We can extend the definition of the logarithm to all of $\Bbb{Q}_2$ (actually even further, see WP) in such a way that $(*)$ holds by declaring that $\log(2)=0$, and, as a consequence of $(*)$ that
$$
\log(2^n(1+x))=\log(1+x)=x-\frac{x^2}2+\cdots
$$ 
for all integers $n$ and all $x\in 2\Bbb{Z}_2$.</p>

<p>The usual business of termwise differentiation of a power series carries over to the 2-adics. Therefore when $x,a\in1+2\Bbb{Z}_2$ we get
$$
\lim_{x\to a}\frac{\log x-\log a}{x-a}=1-(a-1)+(a-1)^2-(a-1)^3+\cdots=\frac1a
$$
because the geometric series converges as $a-1\in2\Bbb{Z}_2$.</p>

"2391312","2391404","<p>Let $T$ be the identity operator $T:c_0\to c_0$. Its adjoint is the identity operator on $\ell_1$. The second adjoint is the identity operator on $\ell_\infty$. So the range of $T^{**}$ need not be in $J(Y)$ for general operators. </p>

<p>However, in  the context $T$ is a <strong>compact</strong> operator. Since $c_0$ has the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_property"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">approximation property</a>, $T$ is the norm-limit of finite rank operators, so it suffices to verify the statement for the case of finite rank. Each such operator is a sum of rank-one operators, so we can assume $\operatorname{rank} T=1$; the general case follows by linearity.</p>

<p>Every rank-one operator $T:X\to Y$ can be written as $T(x) = f(x)y$ for some $f\in X^*$ and $y\in Y$. Then the adjoint is given by $T^*(g) = g(y)x$ (here $g\in Y^*$) and the second adjoint by $T^{**}(\phi) = \phi(f)y$ (here $\phi\in X^{**}$ so it acts on the elements of $X^*$).

<p>$\dot {\vec N}(s) = -\kappa(s) \vec T(s), \tag{10}$</p>

<p>$\dfrac{dp(s)}{ds} = \langle -\kappa(s) \vec T(s), \vec r(s) \rangle = -\kappa(s) \langle \vec T(s), \vec r(s) \rangle = -\kappa(s) t(s).  \tag {12}$</p>

<p>We note there is, as Ted Shifrin indicates in his comment, ""a sign issue""; that is, our formula for $dp/ds$ gives a result with opposite sign of the corresponding equation in the text of the question, $dp/ds = \kappa t$.  Apparently this could be resolved by taking $p = - \langle \vec r, \vec N \rangle$, but present definition of $p(s)$, as the $\vec N(s)$ component of $\vec r(s)$ in the $T(s)$-$N(s)$ frame, is sufficiently natural and clean that I am inclined not to mess with it.  So there we have it.  Hope this helps.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note Added in Edit, Saturday 12 August 2017 10:40 AM PST:</em></strong>  It is perhaps worth adding that there is a corresponding equation for $dt/ds$, based upon (5), to wit:</p>

<p>$\dfrac{dt(s)}{ds} = \langle \dot {\vec T}(s), \vec r(s) \rangle + \langle \vec T(s), \dot {\vec r}(s) \rangle$
$ = \langle \kappa(s) \vec N(s), \vec r(s) \rangle + \langle \vec T(s), \vec T(s) \rangle = \kappa(s) p(s) + 1. \tag {13}$</p>

"2391421","2391441","<p>The short answer is that if $2\vec x$ is in our vector space, then we also want $\tfrac{1}{2}\vec x$ to be in the vector space. Vector spaces scale nicely under multiplication, and things behave weirdly if this scaling isn't true. Let me give one example of weird behavior.</p>

<p>One of the nice aspects of a vector space is that the dimension of a subspace is the same as the number of linearly independent vectors providing a basis for that subspace. Proving this result is usually done with a transferrence-type theorem that says something like the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose $V$ is a vector space of dimension $n$, with $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ as a basis. Suppose $w_1, \ldots, w_m$ are $m$ linearly independent vectors in $V$. Then (perhaps after reordering), $w_1, \ldots, w_m, v_{m+1}, \dots, v_n$ is also a basis for $V$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This allows one to compare the sizes of two bases by progressively replacing one with the other.</p>

<p>The key element of the proof is evident even when there is only one $w_1$ vector of interest. Since $w_1 \in V$, there are coefficients $c_i$ such that
$$ w_1 = \sum_{i \leq n} c_i v_i.$$
As $w_1 \neq 0$, at least one of the $c_i$ are not zero. WLOG (otherwise, reorder), $c_1 \neq 0$. Then we can solve for $v_1$ and see that
$$ v_1 = c_1^{-1}\bigg(\sum_{2 \leq i \leq n} c_i v_i - w_1 \bigg).$$
Thus any vector written in terms of $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ can be written in terms of $w_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$.</p>

<p>In this proof, note that we used $c_1^{-1}$. We used that generic inverses exist! This is essential.</p>

<hr>

<p>We can give a direct example as well. Consider $\mathbb{Z}$ as a $\mathbb{Z}$-module. (If you are not familiar with modules, then you can think of this as trying to define a vector space over a ring instead of a field).</p>

<p>Then $\mathbb{Z}$ has a simple ""basis"": $1$. Every integer in $\mathbb{Z}$ can be written as an integer multiple of $1$. In analogy to vector spaces, can we say that the ""dimension"" of $\mathbb{Z}$ is $1$?</p>

<p>Note that $\mathbb{Z}$ has a different ""basis"", $\mathbb{Z} = \langle 2, 3\rangle$ --- or rather, every integer can be written as an integer multiple of $2$ added to an integer multiple of $3$. But each individual ""basis vector"" ($2$ or $3$) are independent, in the sense that $2$ is not a multiple of $3$ (and vice versa). So is the ""dimension"" of $\mathbb{Z}$ actually $2$?</p>

<p>No --- the concept of dimension is just messier when there isn't a field lying underneath.</p>

The set $\{R;RA=BR\}$ is a vector-space of dimension $3$. Then an equality of the form $Ru=v$, where $u,v$ are given vectors, define in general a unique $R$.</p>

<p>An eigenvector of $A$ (resp. of $B$) associated to $\lambda_i$ is $U_i=[1+37\lambda_i,3\lambda_i,-2\lambda_i+\lambda_i^2]^T$ (resp. $W_i=[1+297\lambda_i,155\lambda_i,-12\lambda_i+\lambda_i^2]^T$) and $P(U_i)=a_iW_i$ where $a_i\in\mathbb{C}$. It is easy to see that $U=\sum_iU_i=[1483,120,1442]^T$ and $P(U)=\sum_ia_iW_i$ is an integer vector.</p>

<p>Thus (*) $\sum_ia_i,\sum_ia_i\lambda_i,\sum_ia_i\lambda_i^2$ are rational numbers and the $(a_i)$ are in $F$, the decomposition-field of $p$. On the other hand, $\dfrac{\det(U_1,U_2,U_3)}{\det(W_1,W_2,W_3)}=3/155$ implies that $a_1a_2a_3=3/155$. </p>

<p>I added a quantifier $\forall t$ in front. Since the true thing happens here is that the equation $N'(t)=-\lambda N(t)$ and $\dfrac{1}{N(t)}N'(t)=-\lambda$ not only hold for one particular, but rather <strong>all</strong> $t\in\mathbb{R}$. (we here ignore the little issue that when $t=0$, the equality might be problematic, since this is another(more little) question, off the topic.)</p>

<p>To repeat, the equation above, are something like: if we first defined $f:\Bbb R\to \Bbb R;x\mapsto x^2+1$, then we can say:</p>

<ul>
<li>$\forall x,~f(x)=x^2+1$</li>
<li>$\forall y,~f(y)=y^2+1$</li>

<p>Here these all expression all have a quantifer in it, specifying the fact that not only the equation(say $\dfrac{f(t)}{f(t)}=1$) hold for one particular $t$(say $t=1.467$), but also <strong>all</strong> $t$ in the real numbers.</p>

<p>Why do I stress on this point? Because due to it, we can integrate both side. </p>

  <p>$\begin{alignedat}{3} \left(\forall t,~\frac{1}{N(t)}N'(t)=-\lambda\right)\Longrightarrow \int\left(\frac{1}{N(t)}N'(t)\right) dt=\int (-\lambda)dt&amp;\quad\text{integrate both side w.r.t. $t$}\end{alignedat}$.</p>

<p>$(\star)$ It should be notice that, if we are dealing with a equation in precalculus, like $2x^2+x+1=0$. To integrate both side with respect to the variable, getting that $\int (2x^2+x+1) dx = \int 0 dx$, is meaningless, and totally wrong. Here the reason that I can integrate the both side, with respect to $t$, is that we have known that the equation holds for all $t\in\Bbb R$ (or at least on some interval). And since the two expressions are <strong>identical</strong> (at least on some interval), there is nothing more or less to integrate $\dfrac{1}{N(t)}N'(t)$ than to integrate $-\lambda$. For example, the result of $\int (x^3+2x-5x+7)dx$ is the same of $\int (x^3+2x-5x+7)dx$, of course!</p>

<p>Now keep going.</p>

"2391509","2396710","<p>This question certainly is too broad to be answered completely. Before talking about infinite dimensional Lie groups you need a concept of infinite dimensional manifolds. As you note correctly, you first need model spaces in infinite dimensions, and the technical difficulties that have to be overcome strongly depend  how general spaces you want to allow. If you are fine with Banach spaces as model spaces, then the theory of smooth manifolds mostly works out closely parallel to the finite dimensional case. There are introductory books on differential geometry working in that setting, for example Serge Lang's classics. This allows dealing with diffeomorphism groups of finite differneitiability class or with Sobolev type completions. To deal with infinitely differentiable diffeomorphisms, you need manifolds modelled on Frechet-spaces, and there things become much more complicated. But infinite dimensional differential geometry works in far more general settings, see e.g. the book ""The Convenient Setting of Global Analysis"" by A. Kriegl and P. Michor. </p>

<p>Having infinite dimensional geometry at hand, you can look at infinite dimensional Lie groups, and indeed the Lie algebra of a diffeomorphism group is the Lie algebra of vector fields with the negative of the usual Lie bracket. Intuitively, you can understand that as follows: A curve in $Diff(M)$ can be viewed as a 1-parameter family $\phi_t$ of diffeomorphisms. To get a tangent vector at the point $\phi=\phi_0$ you should differentiate this curve with respect to $t$ at $t=0$. If you look what happens in a point $x\in M$, then $t\mapsto\phi_t(x)$ is a smooth curve starting at $\phi(x)$, so differentiating this at $t=0$ determines a tangent vector at the point $\phi(x)\in M$. Now you check that this can be done smoothly, so you associate to each $x\in M$ a tangent vector at $\phi(x)$ and this defines a section of the pullback bundle $\phi^*(TM)$. With a bit more work you can indeed construct charts with values in a neighborhood of the zero section in the space of smooth sections of $\phi^*(TM)$ and thus identify that vector space as the modelling vector space. From $\phi=id$, you just get smooth sections of $TM$, i.e. vector fields on $M$. (And the exponential map associates to each vector field its local flow.) You can find a lot of information in that direction in the book by Kriegl and Michor mentioned above.  </p>

"2391524","2393743","<p>Q.1 The author defined $C=A^{T}A$. Denote $C=(c_{ij})$ and $A^{T}=(a_{ij}^{'})$.
Note that $a'_{ij}=a_{ji}$. By the definition of matrix multiplication,
the $(i,j)$-entry of $C$ is given by 
$$
c_{ij}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}a'_{ik}a_{kj}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{ki}a_{kj}.
$$
 Therefore, $k$ is just a dummy variable for writing summation.
There may be a typo in the book and you may need to double check it seriously. Reason: There is a $j$ on LHS but on RHS it becomes a dummy variable. On the other hand, there is no $k$ on LHS but $k$ appears on the RHS.</p>

<p>Q.2 The symbol $\sideset{^{j}}{}A$ denotes the $j-th$ column vector
of the matrix $A$ while the symbol $\sideset{^{i}}{}A^{t}$ denotes

matrix and the outcome is a $1\times1$ matrix, which is identified
with a real number. In short, this symbol denotes the the multiplication
of the $i$-th row of $A^{t}$ by the $j$-th column of $A$. In my opinion, it is a poor choice of notation and I don't know why one denotes a row while the other one denotes a column. (You may need to ask the author.) </p>

  <p>Is there any metric on $C(\mathbb{R})$ that allows for a continuous surjection from $\mathbb{R}$ to $C(\mathbb{R})$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course there is, for a boring reason. Let $F\colon C(\mathbb{R})\to \mathbb R$ be any bijection (the sets have the same cardinality). Define a metric on $C(\mathbb{R})$ by $d(f,g) = |F(f) - F(g)|$. Then $F^{-1}:\mathbb{R}\to C(\mathbb{R})$ is not only a continuous surjection, but an <em>isometric bijection</em>.</p>

<p>Totally useless, of course. </p>

<p>Here is something of more interest. Suppose $(V, d)$ is an infinite-dimensional vector space with a metric $d$ that makes it a complete metric space. Then there is no continuous surjection from $\mathbb R$ onto $V$. </p>

<p>Indeed, if $f:\mathbb{R}\to V$ is such a surjection, then $V$ is $\sigma$-compact:
$$
V = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty K_n,\quad \text{where } K_n=f([-n,n])
$$
But a compact subset of $V$ has empty interior, since <a href=""https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/locally-compact-topological-vector-spaces/"" rel=""noreferrer"">every locally compact Hausdorff topological vector space is finite-dimensional</a>.

<p>In particular, the above applies to $C([0,1])$ with the uniform metric, or to $C(\mathbb R)$ with some natural metrics like 
$$

<p>Use implicit differentiation to find the slope of tangents to the ellipse:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1 $$</p>

<p>$$ \frac{x}{2} + 2y\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 $$</p>

<p>$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-x}{4y} $$</p>

<p>The point of the ellipse closest to line $x + y = 4$ has a tangent parallel to the line (because the line segment connecting that point to the nearest point on the line is perpendicular to both the tangent and the line).  But the slope of the line is easily $m=-1$.</p>

<h2>2. Solution</h2>

<p><strong>2.1. Derivation of the key formula.</strong> Notice that we can write $g(n) = S_n^2$, where $S_n$ is given by</p>

<p>$$S_n = 4^n\left( 1 + 2\sum_{j=1}^{n}(-1)^j \cos^{2n}\left(\frac{j\pi}{2n+1}\right)\right).$$</p>

<p>We perform some algebraic manipulation on $S_n$ by utilizing the identity $2\cos x = e^{\mathrm{i}x} + e^{-\mathrm{i}x}$ and the binomial theorem.</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
S_n
&amp;= 4^n \sum_{j=-n}^{n} (-1)^j \cos^{2n}\left(\frac{j\pi}{2n+1}\right) \\
&amp;= \sum_{j=-n}^{n} (-1)^j \left( 2\cos\left(\frac{j\pi}{2n+1}\right) \right)^{2n}\\
&amp;= \sum_{j=-n}^{n} (-1)^j \sum_{l=0}^{2n}\binom{2n}{l} \exp\left(\mathrm{i}\frac{(2l-2n)j\pi}{2n+1} \right).
\end{align*}</p>

<p>Interchanging the summations and applying $\text{(1.1)}$ and $\text{(1.3)}$ successively, this simplifies to</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
S_n
&amp;\stackrel{\text{(1.1)}}{=} \sum_{l=0}^{2n}\binom{2n}{l} (-1)^{l} \sec\left(\frac{(l-n)\pi}{2n+1}\right) \\
&amp;\stackrel{\text{(1.3)}}{=} \frac{2}{\pi} \sum_{l=0}^{2n}\binom{2n}{l} (-1)^{l} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{u^{2(l-n)/(2n+1)} + u^{-2(l-n)/(2n+1)}}{1+u^2} \, du.
\end{align*}</p>

<p>Applying the binomial theorem and plugging the substitution $u = v^{2n+1}$, we obtain the following integral representation which is a key step to our goal.</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
S_n
= \frac{4}{\pi} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\left(1-u^{2/(2n+1)} \right)^{2n}}{u^{2n/(2n+1)} (1+u^2)} \, du
= \bbox[border:2px dashed green,6px]{ \frac{4(2n+1)}{\pi} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\left(1-v^2 \right)^{2n}}{1+v^{4n+2}} \, dv }. \tag{2.1}
\end{align*}</p>

<p><strong>2.2. Evaluation of the limit.</strong> We estimate our integral representation $\text{(2.1)}$ as follows:</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\left(1-v^2 \right)^{2n}}{1+v^{4n+2}}\, dv
&amp;= \int_{0}^{1} \left(1-v^2 \right)^{2n}\, dv - \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\left(1-v^2 \right)^{2n}v^{4n+2}}{1+v^{4n+2}}\, dv \\
&amp;= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}\frac{\Gamma(2n+1)}{\Gamma(2n+\frac{3}{2})} +\mathcal{O}(16^{-n}).
\end{align*}</p>

<p>Here, the first integral is computed using the beta function identity $\text{(1.2)}$ and the second integral is estimated using the fact that $0 \leq v^2(1-v^2) \leq \frac{1}{4}$ for all $v \in [0,1]$. So it follows that</p>

<p>$$ S_n = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\frac{\Gamma(2n+2)}{\Gamma(2n+\frac{3}{2})} + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{n}{16^n}\right). $$</p>

<p>By the Stirling's approximation, we easily check that $\Gamma(2n+2)/\Gamma(2n+\frac{3}{2}) \sim \sqrt{2n}$ as $n\to\infty$. Here, the relation $\sim$ means that the ratio of two quantities goes to $1$. From this, we obtain</p>

<p>$$ g(n) = \bbox[border:2px dashed green,6px]{ \frac{4}{\pi} \left( \frac{\Gamma(2n+2)}{\Gamma(2n+\frac{3}{2})} \right)^2 + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{n^{3/2}}{16^n}\right) }. \tag{2.2}$$</p>

<p>This already tells that $g(n) \sim \frac{8}{\pi}n$ as $n\to\infty$, so we can expect that $g(n+1) - g(n) = \frac{8}{\pi}$ if it converges. This is indeed true, as we have</p>

<p>$$ g(n+1) - g(n)
= \frac{4}{\pi}
\underbrace{ \left( \left( \frac{4n+6}{4n+5}\cdot\frac{4n+4}{4n+3} \right)^2 - 1 \right) }_{\sim \frac{1}{n}}
\cdot 
\underbrace{ \left( \frac{\Gamma(2n+2)}{\Gamma(2n+\frac{3}{2})} \right)^2 }_{\sim 2n} + o(1) $$</p>

<p>The upshot of this calculation is what we have expected:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( g(n+1)-g(n) \right) = \frac{8}{\pi}.$$</p>

    if (res.contains(A.get(i))     /* O(m) */

return false;
</code></pre>

<p>We can now make the probability model I was using more explicit. I am using a random variable $X$, for the number of iterations of the outer for loop. The variable is in the range $\{0, .., n\}$, $0$ means a duplicate was found in the first iteration and true was return. $n$ means no duplicate was found and false was return.</p>

<p>I did work with $P[X=i] = 1/(n+1)$ an uniform distribution. The effort of the programm can be viewed as the expected value $E[Y]$ of another random variable $Y = f(X)$, that computes the effort for performing the loop X times. For the hash table we have $Y = X$, and for the ordinary list we have $Y = 1/2\,X\,(X+1)$, neglecting the add() and only considering the contains().</p>

<p>Hash table:
$$E[Y]=E[X]=\sum_{i=0}^n P[X=i] i=\frac{1}{n+1} \frac{1}{2} n (n+1)=\frac{1}{2} n$$
Ordinary list:
$$E[Y]=E[\frac{1}{2} X (X+1)]=\sum_{i=0}^n P[X=i] \frac{1}{2} i (i+1)=\frac{1}{n+1} \frac{1}{6} n (n + 1) (n + 2) = \frac{1}{6} n (n+2)$$</p>

<p>The distribution that was chosen can be viewed as an upper bound, distributions that are more realistic or that also consider that there are multiple duplicates, would give a higher weight to lower values of $X$, which also means a higher weight to lower values of $Y = f(X)$, and thus in the end a lower value of $E[Y]$.</p>

"2391787","2391854","<p>Assume first that $E$ is bounded (so $m^*(E)&lt;\infty$) and that $m^*(E)&gt;0$. Let $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Then there exists $I_n$ such that  $E\subset\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$ and
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty l(I_n)\le m^*(E)+\varepsilon\le \sum_{n=1}^\infty m^*(E\cap I_n)+\varepsilon\le \rho \sum_{n=1}^\infty l(I_n)+\varepsilon,$$which implies that

"
"2391790","2391816","<p>First, note that this is not specific to probability or the Stieljes integral. You could have asked the question about a plain vanilla integral $$\int_{-\infty}^\theta f(x)dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty H(\theta-x)f(x)dx$$ where $H$ is the step function. Actually, we can simplify even further and consider derivative with respect to $\theta$ of $$\theta= \int_0^\theta dx = \int_0^\infty H(\theta-x)dx$$ where $\theta &gt; 0.$ Everything about your question still applies here.</p>

<p>We know the derivative of the LHS is one. So what's wrong with the logic of bring the derivative inside the integral and saying it's zero. First, it's not always okay to bring a derivative under the integral sign. Second, I understand the logic that it's zero almost everywhere so thus the integral must be zero, but that's applying rules about functions to something that's fundamentally a distribution (or at least you must treat it as a distribution if you bring the derivative inside). By the same logic the Dirac delta function is zero almost everywhere so it must integrate to zero... in fact we shall see that this analogy is exact.</p>

<p>Let's go back to the definition of the derivative. We want $$\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(\theta+h)-f(\theta)}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{1}{h}\left(\int_0^\infty H(\theta+h-x)dx - \int_0^\infty H(\theta-x)dx\right).$$ Of course these integrals are just silly ways of writing $\theta+h$ and $\theta$ so they converge and there's no question of us combining them under one and we can write our expression $$ \lim_{h\to 0} \int_0^\infty \frac{H(\theta+h-x)-H(\theta-x)}{h}dx.$$</p>

<p>Now we face the all-important question of whether we can bring the limit inside the integral. If we do, we know that we get zero at almost every $x.$ But at the all-important point $x=\theta$ the derivative is undefined. This is where all the action is. </p>

<p>So instead of trying to bring the limit inside, let's look at what the inside function looks like as a function of $x$ for fixed $h.$ It's a rectangle of width $h$ and height $\frac{1}{h}$ with support between $\theta$ and $\theta+h$. Hmm. This is a rectangle of area one that gets arbitrarily tall and thin as $h\to 0.$ So it is an approximation to a Dirac delta. Of course for any $h\ne 0$ the integral is one so the limit is also one, as we knew it had to be. </p>

<p>So, we see the ""derivative of the step function"" behaves exactly as a delta function. This gives us the distribution identity $$ \frac{d}{d\theta} H(\theta-x) = \delta(\theta-x)$$</p>
"
"2391792","2392077","<p>We have four binary operations, not all of them associative, let alone in combinations. Therefore we have to bother about parentheses. There are five ways to put parentheses among four  operands, namely
$$(ab)(cd),\quad\bigl((ab)c\bigr)d,\quad\bigl(a(bc)\bigr)d,\quad a\bigl((bc)d\bigr)\quad a\bigl(b(cd)\bigr)\ .\tag{1}$$
Each time we have three binary operations performed, which we may choose freely from the four basic operations. It follows that there are $5\cdot 4^3=320$ formally different expressions.</p>

<p>If all four variables are put equal to some ""generic"" value $t$ then some of these $320$ expressions will be undefined since there is a division by $0$ involved, and a lot of them will have equal value on account of the rules of algebra. It is an interesting programming exercise to list and count the ""semantically different"" expressions in $t$ resulting in this way. With Mathematica this can be done as follows:</p>

<p>Define a function $f$ of three variables implementing the basic operations  as follows:
$$f(1,x,y):=x+y,\quad f(2,x,y):=x-y,\quad  f(3,x,y):=x*y,\quad f(4,x,y):=x/y\ .$$
Then define a function $g$ of four variables implementing the five terms $(1)$ as follows:
$$g(1,i,j,k):={\tt Simplify}[f(i,f(j,t,t),f(k,t,t))],$$
and so on until $g(5,i,j,k)$. Produce the list of $320$ resulting expressions,  eliminate doubles by using ${\tt Union}$, and remove entries ${\tt Indeterminate}$ etc. by hand. The following picture shows the resulting  final list; it has 64 entries. When, e.g.,  $t=7$ one in fact obtains $64$ different values.</p>

"2391837","2394410","<p>OK. Here's a solution, as far as one is possible. It makes two assumptions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>For each edge $ (a, b) $, there's exactly one other edge whose start or end point is $a$; that other edge's other endpoint is <em>not</em> $b$. So if you have edge $(2, 5)$, then there's an edge like $(2, 4)$ or $(17, 2)$ as well. The same goes for the vertex $b$. </p></li>
<li><p>The number of edges is finite. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>OK, here goes. </p>

<p>STEP 1. </p>

<p>TL; DR: under the equivalence relation defined by ""neighbor"", find all equivalence classes, and organize each into a chain using ""other"". </p>

<p>We're going to form a list of chains (a ""chain"" being a sequence of (edge, vertex) pairs, where the vertex is one of the two vertices of the edge). I'll use the function $other$ which consumes an edge and a vertex of that edge, and returns the other vertex of the edge, so that $other( (2, 5), 2) = 5$ and $other((2, 5), 5) = 2$. I'll also use $neighbor( (a, b), b)$, which returns the unique edge $(b, c)$ or $(c, b)$ that shares vertex $b$ but for which $c \ne a$. Both ""other"" and ""neighbor"" can be implemented by a hashdictionary, for instance, using a single pass through the data. </p>

<p>Init: make the chain list empty; set $i$ to $0$. </p>

<p>While edge list is not empty:
   Create a new empty chain $C$. Remove from the edge list the first edge,  call it $(a, b)$. Set done = false. Place $( (a, b), b)$ into the chain $C$.</p>

<p>while not done:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Let $(e, v)$ be the last item in $C$, and let $e' = neighbor(e, v)$. Let $d = other(e', v)$.</p></li>
<li><p>If d = a, then set done = true, and insert $C$ into the chain list. </p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>When you're done, you'll have a list $L$ of chains. For each chain, you can ignore the edges and just read off the vertices, and these will be the ""faces"" that you're looking for. </p>

<p>STEP 2:</p>

<p>Now you have to decide which are ""faces"" and which are ""holes"". </p>

<p>Unfortunately, from the data given, this cannot be determined. For instance, in the following diagram , there are three chains, which form concentric squares. On the left, the innermost chain bounds an orange square and the outer two together bound a blue ring-shaped face. But on the right, the outer one bounds a blue square, while the inner two bound a ring-shaped orange face. (The blue outer square shows through the hole in the inner ring).

<p>Connect points $G$ and $C$, label angles $\measuredangle 1=\angle EGD=\angle 1$, $\angle 5 =\angle CGD$ and $\angle 6=\angle DGC$.</p>

<p>Then $CE=BD=EG\Rightarrow \measuredangle 1+\angle 6=\angle 3+\angle 5$</p>

<p>Next use the proof by contradition technique:</p>

<p>If $\angle 3=\angle 1$, the result will be easy to prove, so we suppose $\angle 3\ne\angle 1$. Specifically, without the loss of generality, let us suppose:</p>

<p>$\angle 3&gt;\angle 1\Rightarrow \angle 5&lt;\angle 6\tag{1}$</p>

<p>and $\because\angle 1+\angle 2=\angle 3+\angle 4$</p>

<p>On the other hand, the current assumption leads to：</p>

<p>$\angle 3&gt;\angle 1\Rightarrow \angle 4&lt;\angle 2\Rightarrow CD&lt;BE\Rightarrow CD&lt;DG\Rightarrow \angle 6&lt;\angle 5\tag{2}$</p>

<p>(1) conflicts with (2); similarly, the assumption $\angle 3&lt;\angle 1$ will also lead to such contradiction， therefore, we conclude that:</p>

<p>$\angle 1=\angle 3$ ， </p>

"2391863","2392949","<p>Let's take a look at the first integral. First of all, you can use per partes method to get rid of $x$ term in the integral. Let me denote

$$
After per partes, we get
$$

  \int_0^x
  F^k(t)(1-F(t))^{n-k}f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t\,\mathrm{d}x.

So we have

  A = \int_0^1 F^k(t)(1-F(t))^{n-k}f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t
  -
  \int_0^1 \int_0^x F^k(t)(1-F(t))^{n-k}f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t\,\mathrm{d}x.
$$
Now we can use the substitution $y = F(t)$, $\mathrm{d}y = f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t$ and we get:
$$
  A = \underbrace{\int_0^1 y^k(1-y)^{n-k}\,\mathrm{d}y}_{B(k+1,n-k+1)}
  - \int_0^1 \underbrace{\int_0^{F(x)} y^k(1-y)^{n-k}\,\mathrm{d}t}_{B(F(x);k+1,n-k+1)}\,\mathrm{d}x

where $B(x; a,b)$ is the incomplete Beta function [1]. I don't see how to continue now for general $F(x)$, but for $F(x) = x$ it is easy.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I made an error. The following holds only if $F(x) = x$.</p>

It is easy to see that $B(0; a, b) = 0$ and we are left with
$$
  A

"2391908","2391980","<p>Hmm, so how can I <em>teach</em> one to see this?</p>

<p>Whenever you are asked to figure out if $A$ is greater than $B $ there are two things you should consider if you don't know what else to do:</p>

<p>2) Look at $A-B $ and see if it is greater or less than $0$.</p>

<p>Doing 1) we get $\frac {a^2+b^2}{2ab} $.   (But only if $a $ and both are both non-zero!  And we don't know if $ab $ is positive or negative.) Maybe or maybe not the geometric vs arithmetic mean inequality will jump out at you. ($\frac {x+y}2\ge \sqrt{xy} $ for positive $x,y $)  .... I'll forgive you if it doesn't.  It didn't jump out at me either.  And maybe you haven't learned it yet.</p>

<p>But I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that $\frac {a^2+b^2}2\ge \sqrt {|a^2b^2|}=|ab|\ge ab $ so $\frac {a^2+b^2}{2|ab|} \ge 1$ and $a^2+b^2\ge 2|ab|\ge 2ab $.  I'd be especially remiss as <em>I'm</em> the one who told you to look in the first place.</p>

<p>We get $a^2+b^2-2ab $.  Now that should <em>really</em> look like something <em>very</em> familiar.  It should <em>scream</em>  $a^2+b^2-2ab=a^2-2ab+b^2=(a-b)^2$.</p>

<p>Now what were we doing?  Oh, yes.  We were trying to see if $a^2+b^2-2ab=(a-b)^2$ was greater or less than  $0$.</p>

<p>Well.... it's a square.  Squares are always greater or equal to $0$.  So $a^2+b^2\ge 2ab $.  And $(a-b)^2=0$ only if $a=b $.  So $a^2+b^2 &gt;2ab $ unless $a=b $ (in which case they are equal...obviously).</p>

<p>This still happens if you replace $\mathbb{R}$ by another Polish space; the continuous image of a Polish space into another Polish space is (by definition) analytic, and all analytic sets in a Polish space are universally measurable (though not necessarily Borel).

<p>Q1: let $\mu$ be the pushforward of $m$ under $f$ and let $E$ be the support of $\mu$.  The inclusion $E \subset \overline{f(\mathbb{R})}$ is an immediate consequence of definitions.

entourages, following the axioms as described in <a href=""https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a></p>

<p>First check that $\mathcal{B}_x:= \{V[x]: V \in \mathcal{U}\}$ (which is
non-empty, as $\mathcal{U}$ is non-empty) is a filter base (closed under
finite intersections even):</p>

<ul>
<li>$x \in V[x]$ for every $V \in \mathcal{U}$, as $(x,x) \in \Delta
\subseteq V$. So all $V[x]$ are non-empty. </li>
<li>If $V[x], W[x]$ are in
$\mathcal{B}_x$, so $V,W \in \mathcal{U}$, then  $U = V \cap W\in
\mathcal{U}$. Then $U[x] = V[x] \cap W[x]$, which follows from the
definitions: $y \in U[x]$ iff $(x,y) \in U$ iff $(x,y) \in V$ and $(x,y)
\in W$ iff $y \in V[x]$ and $y \in W[x]$ iff $y \in V[x] \cap W[x]$.</li>
</ul>

<p>The claim on the page should  be that the generated filter</p>

<p>$$\mathcal{U}_x = \{O \subseteq X \mid \exists U \in \mathcal{U}: U[x]
\subseteq O\}$$</p>

<p>is the neighbourhood filter of the topology</p>

<p>$$\mathcal{T} = \{O \subseteq X \mid \forall x \in O: O \in
\mathcal{U}_x\}$$</p>

<p>This $\mathcal{T}$ is the topology induced by the uniformity.<br>
Let's check first that this actually defines a topology:</p>

<ul>
<li>$\emptyset \in \mathcal{T}$ because a $\forall x \in O$ formula always
holds for $O = \emptyset$, it's vacuously true. $X \in \mathcal{T}$
because for every $x \in X$, $X \in \mathcal{U_x}$ because $X$ is a
superset of any member of $\mathcal{B}_x$ (which as said is non-empty).</li>
<li>If $O_1, O_2 \in \mathcal{T}$, it suffices to show that $O_1 \cap O_2
\in \mathcal{T}$: let $x \in O_1 \cap O_2$. As $O_1$ is open, $O_1 \in
\mathcal{U_x}$. Also, because $O_2$ is open, $O_2 \in \mathcal{U}_x$.
This in turn means we have $U \in \mathcal{U}$ with $U[x] \subseteq O_1$
and $V \in \mathcal{U}$ such that $V[x] \subseteq O_2$. We saw at the
top that $(U \cap V)[x] = U[x] \cap V[x] \subseteq O_1 \cap O_2$, and as
$U \cap V \in \mathcal{U}$ we see that $O_1 \cap O_2 \in \mathcal{U}_x$.
As this holds for all $x \in O_1 \cap O_2$, $O_1 \cap O_2 \in
\mathcal{T}$. </li>
<li>If $O_i \in \mathcal{T}$, for $i \in I$, then $O =
\bigcup_i O_i \in \mathcal{T}$: let $x \in O$. Then for some $i_0 \in
I$, $x \in O_{i_0}$, and as the latter set is open, we know that $O_{i_0}
\in \mathcal{U}_x$, and so, as $O_{i_0} \subseteq O$,
so also $O \in \mathcal{U}_x$, and as $x \in O$ was arbitrary, $O \in
\mathcal{T}$ as required.</li>
</ul>

<p>So far, we've used very little of the axioms for a uniformity. To see
that $\mathcal{B}_x$ is actually a local base at $x$ for $\mathcal{T}$, we need a small 
lemma, that will use the missing axioms later on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If $U \in \mathcal{U}$ be symmetrical and suppose $V$ is an entourage such that 
  $V \circ V \subseteq U$, we have that 
  $$\forall y \in V[x] : V[y] \subseteq U[x]$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proof: take $y \in V[x]$ and to see the inclusion pick $z \in V[y]$. We have $(x,y) \in V$
and $(y,z) \in V$ so $(x,z) \in V \circ V \subseteq U$, so $(x,z) \in U$ by symmetry,
and hence $z \in U[x]$; this shows $V[y] \subseteq U[x]$.</p>

<p>This lemma provides a link between neighbourhood systems of different points, while
so far everything has been very ""pointwise"".</p>

<p>Then let $\mathcal{N}_x$ be the neighbourhood filter of $x$ as determined by the topology $\mathcal{T}$: i.e.</p>

<p>$$\mathcal{N}_x = \{N: \exists O \in \mathcal{T}: x \in O \subseteq N\}$$</p>

<p>We want to show that $\mathcal{N}_x = \mathcal{U}_x$ for all $x$.
This would show that the $\mathcal{B}_x = \{U[x]: U \in \mathcal{U}\}$ form a base of neighbourhoods for $\mathcal{T}$ at $x$,
which is what we wanted to show.</p>

<p>Left to right inclusion:
Suppose $N \in \mathcal{N}_x$ so there is $x \in O \subseteq N$. As $O$ is open and $x \in O$ we
have that $O \in \mathcal{U}_x$, and so $N \in \mathcal{U}_x$ as this is a filter. Pretty much by construction.</p>

<p>Right to left:
Let $N \in \mathcal{U}_x$.<br>
Define:
$$O = \{p \in X: N \in \mathcal{U}_p\}$$</p>

<p>Then by definition $x \in O$. Also, $O \subseteq N$ is clear ($y \in O \implies N \in \mathcal{B}_y$ 
and as all members of $\mathcal{B}_y$ contain $y$, $y \in N$ as well).</p>

<p>Let $y \in O$, so that $O \in \mathcal{U}_y$. This says that there is some $U \in \mathcal{U}$
such that $U[y] \subseteq O$. WLOG we can choose $U$ to be symmetrical, otherwise we replace it by 
$U \cap U^{-1} \in \mathcal{U}$, which is symmetrical. (by axioms 3,5). By axiom 4 we then find 
$V \in \mathcal{U}$ such that $V \circ V \subseteq U$.
We then have for all $z \in V[y]$ that $V[z] \subseteq U[y] \subseteq O$, so $O \in \mathcal{U}_z$ 
for all $z \in V[y]$. Hence $V[y] \subseteq O$ by definition.
So in summary </p>

<p>$$\forall y \in O: \exists V \in \mathcal{U}: V[y] \subseteq O$$ </p>

<p>This implies that (by the definition of $\mathcal{U}_x$):</p>

<p>$$\forall y \in O:  O \in \mathcal{U}_x$$</p>

<p>So $O \in \mathcal{T}$ and hence is open. So we have found $O$ open such that $x \in O \subseteq N$, so $N \in \mathcal{N}_x$.
This concludes the proof of the inclusion. </p>

<p>We only need one invocation of axiom 4 (the ""halving axiom"") so I don't quite understand the remark about recursive use of this axiom that you mentioned.</p>

"2392007","2392022","<p>It's easier to transform the question to a question about matrices. Once you choose a basis for your vector space $V$, a linear map $T$ is represented uniquely by an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ whose entries are elements of $\mathbb{F}_2$ ($0$ or $1$). The linear map will be surjective iff it is injective iff it has full rank. In terms of matrices, this means that the matrices that represent surjective matrices are matrices $A$ for which $\operatorname{rank}(A) = n$. </p>

<p>Let's start with some basic observations. The number of $n \times 1$ column vectors with entries in $\mathbb{F}_2$ is $2^n$ (each entry can be either $0$ or $1$). The number of elements in a vector space of dimension $k$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$ is $2^k$ because once you choose a basis $e_1,\dots,e_k$ for $V$, each element is a unique linear combination $a_1 e_1 + \dots + a_k e_k$ where $a_i \in \mathbb{F}_2$. </p>

<p>A matrix $A \in M_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$ has full rank if and only if its columns are linearly independent. This means that a matrix $A$ has full rank if and only if the first column is non-zero and the $k$-th column of the matrix doesn't belong to the span of the $1,\dots,k-1$ columns for $2 \leq k \leq n$. Having this in mind, we have $2^n - 1$ options for the first column (any non-zero vector in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$), $2^n - 2$ options for the second column (any vector that doesn't belong to the span of the first column), $2^n - 2^2$ options for the third column and so on. Hence, the number of full rank $n \times n$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_2$ is</p>

<p>I suggest to compute the surface integral. To this end let $a$, $b$, $c$ be the semiaxes of the ellipsoid. Then you have a parametric representation of the form
$${\bf r}(\phi,\theta)=\bigl(a\cos\theta\cos\phi,b\cos\theta\sin\phi,c\sin\theta\bigr)\ ,$$
whereby $\phi$ and $\theta$ are GPS coordinates on $S^2$. Now it so happens that $F_1$ is odd in $y$, and $F_2$ is odd in $x$, whereas the normal vector ${\bf r}_\phi\times{\bf r}_\theta$ is even in both $x$ and $y$, by symmetry of the ellipsoid. This implies that from $F\cdot({\bf r}_\phi\times{\bf r}_\theta)$ we only have to compute $$F_3\&gt;({\bf r}_\phi\times{\bf r}_\theta)_3=a^2c\cos^2\theta\sin\theta\cos^2\phi\cdot ab\cos\theta\sin\theta\ .$$
Now you have to integrate this over $0\leq\phi\leq2\pi$ and over $\theta_1\leq\theta\leq{\pi\over2}$, whereby $\theta_1$ is defined by the condition $c\sin\theta_1=1$. Since $\int_0^{2\pi}\cos^2\phi\&gt;d\phi=\pi$ we obtain in this way

"2392145","2392897","<p>As per my comments, having more stocks than observed returns per stocks results in a singular covariance matrix if this matrix is estimated as follows: </p>

<p>Let $r_t$ be a vector of $N$ returns at time $t$. If we estimate $\mathbf{E}[r_tr_t']$ by
$S:=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T r_tr_t'.$
Then any column $i$ of $S$ is
$\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T r_tr_{i,t}$
with $r_{i,t}$ being the $i$th element of $r_t$. This means that column $i$ is a linear combination of $T$ vectors. Moreover, all columns are linear combinations of the same $T$ vectors.
Hence, the rank of $S$ cannot exceed $min(T,N)$. And so, if $T&lt;N$ this results in a singular covariance matrix. </p>

<p>A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_matrix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">generator matrix</a> is a matrix whose rows form a basis for a linear code.</p>

<p>Let's inspect $2$nd, $4$th, and $6$th row of the generator matrix, they are $\begin{bmatrix}  1&amp; 0 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}  0&amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}$, and $\begin{bmatrix}  0&amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}.$</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>As OP uses $6$-bit codeword, the convention is different. Hence one strategy would be take your matrix $G$ and take its transpose, $G^T$. Perform row operations to reduce it to its RREF form, that is in the form of $(I|P)$. After which, the parity check matrix is of the form of $(P^T|I)$</p>

"2392266","2392284","<p>If $M = I$ then $B_M$ is just the closed unit ball. When $E$ is infinite dimensional, it is well known that the closed unit ball is not compact. When $E$ is finite dimensional, the compact sets of $E$ are precisely the closed and bounded sets (with respect to the distance induced by $\| \cdot \|$). For arbitrary $M$, your set is closed but not necessarily bounded so it won't generally be compact. For the finite dimensional case, let's characterize completely when $B_M$ is compact.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: The set $B_M$ is compact if and only if $\left&lt; Mv, v \right&gt; = 0$ implies that $v = 0$.</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong>: Assume that $B_M$ is compact and let $v \in V$ such that $\left&lt; Mv, v \right&gt; = 0$. In particular, $v \in B_M$. But then $nv$ also belongs to $B_M$ because
$$\left&lt; M(nv), nv \right&gt; = n^2 \left&lt; Mv, v \right&gt; = 0. $$
Since $B_M$ is compact, it is bounded so there exists some $C &gt; 0$ such that $\| nv \| = n \| v \| \leq C$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This implies that $\| v \| \leq \frac{C}{n}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ so $v = 0$. On the other hand, assume that $B_M$ is not compact. Since it is always closed, we must have an unbounded sequence $v_n$ of vectors in $B_M$. Set $w_n = \frac{v_n}{\| v_n \|}$. Since the $\| \cdot \|$ unit sphere is compact and $\| w_n \| = 1$, it must have a convergent subsequence which we will still denote by $w_n$ which converges to $w$. Since $\| w_n \| = 1$ we also have $\| w \| = 1$ and in particular $w \neq 0$. Since $v_n \in B_M$ we have
$$ 0 \leq \left&lt; Mw_n, w_n \right&gt; = \frac{\left&lt; Mv_n, v_n \right&gt;}{\| v_n \|^2} \leq \frac{1}{\| v_n \|^2} \to 0 $$
so by continuity of the inner product, we have $\left&lt; Mw_n, w_n \right&gt; \to \left&lt; Mw, w \right&gt; = 0$.</p>

<p>When $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{C}$, we have that $B_M$ is compact if and only if $M$ is invertible. The reason is that the condition $\left&lt; Mv, v \right&gt; \geq 0$ for all $v \in V$ implies that $M$ is Hermitian and a Hermitian operator which satisfies $\left&lt; Mv, v \right&gt; &gt; 0$ for all $v \neq 0$ must be invertible. When $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{R}$, $M$ can be invertible with $B_M$ non-compact. For example, if $V = \mathbb{R}^2$ and $M$ is the rotation by $\frac{\pi}{2}$ degrees then $\left&lt; Mv, v \right&gt; = 0$ for all $v \in V$ so $B_M = \mathbb{R}^2$ and $M$ is invertible. In fact, one can show that $B_M$ is compact if and only if the symmetrization $M + M^T$ of $M$ is invertible.</p>

"2392289","2392294","<p>Your idea is great. First, you shouldn't call the two matrices that lie in the subspace $A$ and $B$ because the name $B$ is already taken. If you take two matrices $A_1,A_2$ in this set so that $A_1B = BA_1$ and $A_2B = BA_2$ and $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ then</p>

<p>$$ (aA_1 + bA_2)B = aA_1B + bA_2B = aBA_1 + bBA_2 = B(aA_1 + bA_2) $$</p>

"2392313","2392653","<p>Indeed, the literal negative answer to the first question includes the standard counter-example as given by @JoseCarlosSantos.
Still, modifying the question/example somewhat in various ways gives a more positive answer. First, if we insist on ""algebraic"" representations (in some sense...) this could be arranged to exclude the counter-example.</p>

<p>Or, for example, instead of $G=GL_2$, trying $G=SL_2$ avoids the counter-example.</p>

<p>In either style of avoiding that (and related) counter-examples, H. Weyl's ""unitarian trick"" tries to arrange that a finite-dimensional repn (under some hypotheses...) of a reductive (linear...) real Lie group can be <em>complexified</em>, and then restricted to a repn of the compact real form, thus reducing many questions to the repn theory of compact Lie groups.</p>

<p>Thus, under mild (but non-trivial) hypotheses such repns are completely reducible, and so on. But you are right, that they don't have invariant inner products for the (original) non-compact group, although they do have such for the compact real form, which enables Weyl's proofs (under various suitable hypotheses to make the argument possible).</p>

"2392451","2392804","<p>To answer your first question: It appears you have already recognized that
$$\psi:=\phi_x\quad\&amp;\quad\rho:=\phi_t\\\implies\psi_x=\phi_{xx}\quad\&amp;\quad\rho_t=\phi_{tt}\\\implies\psi_x=\rho_t\qquad(*)$$
To obtain the second equation, we need to factor the operator from the original PDE.
$$\begin{align}\phi_{tt}-\phi_{xx}&amp;=\left(\partial_t^2-\partial_x^2\right)\phi=\left(\partial_t-\partial_x\right)\left(\partial_t+\partial_x\right)\phi\\&amp;=\left(\partial_t-\partial_x\right)\left(\psi+\rho\right)=\psi_t+\rho_t-\psi_x-\rho_x=0\end{align}$$
We know from $(*)$ that $\psi_x-\rho_t=0$, thus
$$\psi_t-\rho_x=\psi_x-\rho_t=0\implies\psi_t=\rho_x$$</p>

<p>To answer your second question: Because we modified the PDE of a single function to be a system with 2 functions, we need twice the number of conditions to make sure we properly satisfy the original PDE. In order to obtain these boundary conditions, we need to assume smoothness in $\phi$, meaning
$$\phi_{xt}=\phi_{tx}$$
on the closure. Now take derivatives of the radiation conditions:
$$\partial_t\left(\phi_t-\phi_x\right)=\phi_{tt}-\phi_{tx}=\rho_t-\rho_x=0\\\implies\rho_t(0,t)=\rho_x(0,t)$$
$$\partial_x\left(\phi_t-\phi_x\right)=\phi_{tx}-\phi_{xx}=\psi_t-\psi_x=0\\\implies\psi_t(0,t)=\psi_x(0,t)$$
$$\partial_t\left(\phi_t+\phi_x\right)=\phi_{tt}+\phi_{tx}=\rho_t+\rho_x=0\\\implies\rho_t(1,t)=-\rho_x(1,t)$$
$$\partial_x\left(\phi_t+\phi_x\right)=\phi_{tx}+\phi_{xx}=\psi_t+\psi_x=0\\\implies\psi_t(1,t)=-\psi_x(1,t)$$
This is not my favorite, but one of many approaches to solve the wave equation.</p>

"2392479","2392564","<p>I think it is helpful to think about these concepts on an arbitrary manifold. In that setting, <em>there is no such thing as a position vector</em>, because the manifold may not be a vector space; positions are specified instead by local coordinates.</p>

<p>The only reason we can identify positions with vectors in Euclidean space and move them around is that (1) Euclidean space is a vector space, and (2) the space carries an affine connection, which supplies a notion of parallel transport. You can't even ""move around"" <em>tangent</em> vectors on an arbitrary <em>manifold</em> unless you have a connection (though every <em>Riemannian</em> manifold comes with a natural one, the Levi-Civita connection); and in addition, as Ted says in his answer, you can't imagine those tangent vector glued ""wherever you like"" unless the tangent bundle is trivializable. The tangent bundle on a <em>vector space</em> is always trivializable.</p>

<hr>

<p>A very useful example to keep in mind is polar coordinates in the Euclidean plane. Here a position is specified by $(r,\theta)$ or, especially in physics and engineering, a ""position vector"" $r\mathbf{\hat{r}}$. The former is the manifold point of view; the latter exploits the fact that we are laying curvilinear coordinates on what, at bottom, is a vector space. But you quickly learn this thing called a position vector is not really a position vector, because the vector $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ changes from point to point. It doesn't live in the underlying space; rather, it lives in the tangent bundle, and the tangent spaces change from point to point. We are only able to think of it as a bona fide position vector because we imagine uprooting it from its tangent space and gluing it instead to the tangent space at the origin. But, to repeat, in a general manifold, the underlying space isn't necessarily a vector space and doesn't necessarily have a zero vector. </p>

<p>In general, to specify a position we just gives its local coordinates, and that is that: we don't need a vector to specify a position. You might wonder, then, where velocity vectors come from, because we're so used to getting velocity vectors by differentiating position vectors. But <strong>velocity vectors in arbitrary manifolds don't come from differentiating position vectors</strong>. They come from partial differentiation in directions specified by the local coordinates. More precisely, given local coordinates $(x_1, x_2)$, we represent a velocity vector as the operator  $a\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}+b\frac{\partial}{\partial x_2}$. (This is part of the reason, I think, many people struggle with the abstract definition of a tangent vector. For years they have been allowed to think of a velocity vector as the derivative of a position vector.)</p>

<p>You can see how the two points of view diverge when you ask a physicist or engineer to tell undergraduates how to represent velocity or acceleration vectors in planar polar coordinates. Most likely, they will draw a nice picture showing why the (time) derivative (along some curve) of $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ is $\dot{\theta}\mathbf{\hat{\theta}}$. But the picture only works if you can parallel transport the tangent basis vectors $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ and $\mathbf{\hat{\theta}}$ at a later point back along the curve to the tangent space at the initial point -- and it is exactly this seemingly innocent feature of the picture that requires an affine connection in general. What the calculation is really doing is exploiting the standard Euclidean connection to specify the covariant derivative / Christoffel symbols of planar polar coordinates.</p>

"2392489","2392495","<p>Yes, if you know the $d_n$ are positive and increasing that is enough to conclude the sequence diverges.

"2392534","2392543","<p>Gauss lemma can be stated in form that product of primitive polynomials is primitive polynomial. It is not loss of generality to assume that $P$ is primitive. Now, we know that $S(x)$ has rational coefficients, so there exists primitive polynomial with integer coefficients $S_0(x)$ such that $S_0(x) = qS(x)$. Thus, $qP(x) = (3x-2)S_0(x)$, so $qP(x)$ must be primitive which implies that $q = \pm 1$, i.e. $S$ has integer coefficients.</p>

<hr>

<p>Let me do the general statement. Let $p(x)$ be primitive polynomial with integer coefficients and let $p(x) = f(x)g(x)$ be its factorization over $\mathbb Q$. Then, there exist primitive polynomials with integer coefficients $f_0$ and $g_0$ and rational numbers $q_1$ and $q_2$ such that $q_1f(x) = f_0(x)$, $q_2g(x) = g_0(x)$. Let $q = q_1q_2$.

<p>Indeed, let $q = a/b$ with $a$ and $b$ relatively prime and let $\alpha_i$ be coefficients of $p$. First of all, we have that $a\alpha_i/b$ are all integers, so $b$ divides all $\alpha_i$. By assumption of $p$ being primitive, $b = 1$. Finally, we have that $ap$ is primitive, and since $p$ has integer coefficients, $a = \pm 1$.

"2392555","2392659","<p>Yes, they are different inner products. In fact, because there are two different conventions for how the wedge product relates to the tensor product, there are actually three different possible inner products on differential forms.</p>

<p><strong>1. The Pointwise Hodge Inner Product:</strong> This is the inner product on differential forms that satisfies 
$$
\langle\varepsilon^{i_1}\wedge\dots\wedge\varepsilon^{i_k},\varepsilon^{i_1}\wedge\dots\wedge\varepsilon^{i_k}\rangle = 1
$$
whenever $i_1&lt;\dots&lt;i_k$ and $(\varepsilon^1,\dots,\varepsilon^n)$ is a local orthonormal frame for $T^*M$. It's also characterized by
$$
\omega \wedge *\eta = \langle\omega,\eta\rangle dV_g,
$$
where $*$ is the Hodge star operator and $dV_g$ is the Riemannian volume form. In particular, on $\mathbb R^2$ with the Euclidean metric, it satisfies 
$$
\langle dx^1\wedge dx^2,dx^1\wedge dx^2\rangle = 1. 
$$
This inner product is universally used in Hodge theory.</p>

<p>(The terminology ""pointwise Hodge inner product"" is not standard, but it's the most accurate name I can think of for this inner product, given that the term <strong><em>Hodge inner product</em></strong> usually refers to the corresponding global inner product on differential forms obtained by integrating this pointwise inner product.)</p>

<p><strong>2. The Tensor Inner Product:</strong> This is obtained from the usual inner product on tensors, by viewing the bundle of differential $k$-forms as a subbundle of the bundle of covariant $k$-tensors. The relationship between this and the pointwise Hodge inner product depends on which convention is used for wedge products. In my books, I refer to these conventions as the <strong><em>determinant convention</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Alt convention</em></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>2a. Using the determinant convention:</strong>
This is the wedge product convention that satisfies 
$$
\omega^1\wedge\dots \wedge \omega^k(v_1,\dots,v_k) = \det (\omega^j(v_k))
$$
when $\omega^1,\dots,\omega^k$ are covectors and $v_1,\dots,v_k$ are vectors.
In particular, with this convention, we have $dx^1\wedge dx^2 = dx^1\otimes dx^2 - dx^2 \otimes dx^1$, so
$$
\langle dx^1\wedge dx^2,dx^1\wedge dx^2\rangle = 2. 
$$</p>

<p><strong>2b. Using the Alt convention:</strong>
With this convention, the wedge product is determined by 
$$
\omega\wedge\eta = \operatorname{Alt} (\omega\otimes \eta)
$$
when $\omega$ and $\eta$ are any differential forms whatever.
In particular, with this convention, we have $dx^1\wedge dx^2 = \tfrac 1 2 (dx^1\otimes dx^2 - dx^2 \otimes dx^1)$, so
$$
\langle dx^1\wedge dx^2,dx^1\wedge dx^2\rangle = \tfrac 1 2. 
$$</p>

<p>More generally, the tensor inner product is $k!$ times the pointwise Hodge inner product on $k$-forms if you use the determinant convention, and $(1/k!)$ times if you use the Alt convension.</p>

$$P(X &gt; 1200) = 1 - P(X \le 1200) = 
1-P\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} \le \frac{1200 - 1100}{60}\right)\\
= 1 - P(Z \le 1.67) = 1 -  0.9525 = 0.0475,$$
where the approximate numerical answer can be obtained from printed tables of the standard
normal CDF.</p>

<p>You can get a slightly more accurate answer using software without having to standardize. For
example in R statistical software. The improved accuracy is because rounding
is avoided. (In R, <code>pnorm</code> is the CDF of the normal distribution with mean
and SD given in the second and third arguments.)</p>

<pre><code>1 - pnorm(1200, 1100, 60)
## 0.04779035
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Then in the last part, you seek $w$ such that $P(X \le w) = 0.10.$ So write
$$P(X \le w) = P\left(\frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \le \frac{w-1100}{60}\right)
= P(Z \le (w-1100)/60) = 0.10,$$
Then by normal tables $(w-1100)/60 \approx -1.28,$ and you can solve for $w.$</p>

<p>A slightly more accurate answer can be obtained by software:</p>

<pre><code> qnorm(.1, 1100, 60)   # 'qnorm' is the inverse CDF or 'quantile' function
 ## 1023.107
 pnorm(1023, 1100, 60) # as a check

"2392568","2392748","<p>Yes, it's true. Indeed, we can locally write the BCH formula as
$$\log(e^xe^y)=x+y+\frac12[x,y]+Q(x,y,[x,y]).$$
Here $Q$ is defined as follows: the remainder (sum of terms of order $\ge 3$ in BCH) is written as $\sum_i \lambda_iP_i(x,y)([x,y])$, where $P_i$ is some nonempty finite product of the operators $\mathrm{ad}(x)$ and $\mathrm{ad}(y)$, and $Q(x,y,z)=\sum \lambda_iP_i(x,y)(z)$. In particular we can bound around zero $\|Q(x,y,z)\|\le C\max(\|x\|,\|y\|)\|z\|$ for a suitable constant (and choice of norms). </p>

<p>If $e^xe^y=e^ye^x$ for small $x,y$, this yields<br>
$$x+y+\frac12[x,y]+Q(x,y,[x,y])=y+x+\frac12[y,x]+Q(y,x,[y,x]),$$

$$[x,y]=Q(y,x,-[x,y])-Q(x,y,[x,y]).$$</p>

<p>This yields $\|[x,y]\|\le 2C\max(\|x\|,\|y\|)\|[x,y]\|$. If $[x,y]\neq 0$, this yields $1\le 2C\max(\|x\|,\|y\|)$, which is a contradiction if $(x,y)$ is too close to $(0,0)$.</p>

This is what most of the funds are doing.</p>

<p>Another way is to study correlations between different assets, events and assets etc. For instance if the price of petrol goes up, then the price of transporting the commodities will also go up, which will affect the prices of the transported commodities too. <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Can-Twitter-sentiment-analysis-guide-stock-market-investment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sentiment analysis and correlation with stock markets</a> was once a subject of serious studies, probably still is.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hedging</a> is another good strategy.

<p>And I only listed 4. One important thing I should mention, finding specific examples of anomalies (rather than classes of anomalies) which work is quite hard. Those in books are almost surely outdated (this isn't suggesting not to read books, books are still good sources of inspiration). The new ones are being exploited and once made public - they aren't successful anymore.

"2392728","2392741","<p>I use the following fact below, so I thought it would be useful to prove it first.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If $f:A\to\mathbb{R}$ is such that $f(a)\geq 0$ for every $a\in A$ and $\sum_{a\in A}f(a)&lt;\infty$, then $[f&gt;0]$ (notation for $\{a\in A \mid f(a)&gt;0\}$) is countable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof:</em>
For each $x&gt;0$, consider the set $[f&gt;x]$. Note that
$$
\operatorname{card}([f&gt;x])x \leq \sum_{a\in[f&gt;x]}f(a) \leq \sum_{a\in A}f(a) &lt; \infty.
$$
Thus $[f&gt;x]$ is finite. Therefore $[f&gt;0] = \cup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}[f&gt;1/n]$ is countable, as it is a countable union of finite sets. $\square$</p>

<p>Now we consider the problem. Since $f(a)\geq0$ for all $a\in A$ and $\sum_{a\in A}f(a)$ converges, it must converge absolutely. Let $A':=\{a\in A \mid f(a)&gt;0\}$. Then $A'$ must be countable, for otherwise $\sum_{a\in A}f(a)$ would diverge. Let's enumerate $A'=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots\}$ [thanks to Adayah for noticing mistake here]. Now we have
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(a_n) = \sum_{a\in A'}f(a)=\sum_{a\in A}f(a)= 1.
$$
Let $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Since the above sum converges, there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $\sum_{n=N}^\infty f(a_n) &lt; \varepsilon$.
Then whenever $x&lt;\min_{n&lt; N}a_n$, we have
$$
F(x) = \sum_{a\leq x}f(a) \leq \sum_{n=N}^\infty f(a_n) &lt; \varepsilon.
$$
This proves that $\lim_{x\to-\infty}F(x)=0$. $\square$</p>

<p>I want to remark that we didn't actually need $\sum_{a\in A}f(a)=1$. We just needed the sum to converge.</p>

<hr>

<p>Response to old version of question:</p>

<p>Even with the edits, there still seems to be something wrong. Consider $A=\{0\}$ and $f:A\to\mathbb{R}$ given by $f(0) = 1$. Then indeed $f(a)\geq 0$ for any $a\in A$ and $\sum_{a\in A}f(a)=1$. However, for all $x\geq 0$, we have $F(x)=1$. Therefore $\lim_{x\to\infty}F(x)=1$.</p>

"
"2392763","2395300","<p>Yes, this is computable now that you have edited the problem by putting a minus sign in front of the second integral term (rather than a plus sign).</p>

<p>You are on the right track by using Girsanov's theorem. I will use the same change-of-measure and the same notation that you have used in the question.</p>

<p>Since $\tilde B_t = B_t - \int_0^t B_s ds$, it follows from the product rule that that $$\tilde B_t e^{-t} = \frac{d}{dt} \bigg[ e^{-t} \int_0^t B_sds \bigg] \;\;\;\; \Longrightarrow\;\;\;\; \int_0^t \tilde B_se^{-s}ds = e^{-t} \int_0^t B_sds $$ where I integrated both sides to get the implication. Now multiplying both sides by $e^t$ and then differentiating yields \begin{align*} B_t &amp;= \frac{d}{dt} \bigg[ e^t \int_0^t \tilde B_s e^{-s}ds \bigg] \\ &amp;= \tilde B_t +\int_0^t \tilde B_s e^{t-s}ds \\ &amp;= \int_0^t e^{t-s}d \tilde B_s\end{align*}</p>

<p>where I used a stochastic integration-by-parts in the last equality. </p>

<p>Thus we have written $B_t$ in terms of the process $(\tilde B_s)$. But since $(\tilde B_s)$ is a Brownian motion under $\tilde P$, the above computation reveals that $B_t$ is distributed as a mean-zero Gaussian under $\tilde P$. Moreover its variance can be easily computed by using the Itô isometry: $$\sigma^2=\Bbb E^{\tilde P} [ B_t^2 ]  = \Bbb E^{\tilde P} \bigg[ \bigg( \int_0^t e^{t-s}d\tilde B_s \bigg)^2 \bigg] = \int_0^t e^{2(t-s)}ds = \frac{1}{2}(e^{2t}-1)$$</p>

<p>Now, if $Z$ is a mean-zero Gaussian, then it is well-known that $E[e^Z] = e^{\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2}$, therefore we find that $$\Bbb E^P\left[ e ^ { B_t + \int_{0}^{t}B_s\mathrm dB_s - \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{t}B^2_s\mathrm ds  } \right]=\Bbb E^{\tilde P}[e^{B_t}] = e^{\frac{1}{4}(e^{2t}-1)}$$ I may have made an error in some of the computations, maybe someone can post a different method to verify.</p>

<p>Proof:  The point $(0,1)$ is not in the image of $h$.  If it were, there would be a point $(x,y) \in A \times B$ with $h(x,y) = (2x-2y, 5x-3y) = (0,1)$.  This implies that $2x-2y=0$, so that $x=y$.  But $x$ is odd and $y$ is even, so this is a contradiction.</p>

Substitute in $x=y+a-b$ and do the algebra, and you'll get $y=b$.  Plug this back in to $x=y+a-b$ to see that $x=a$.  We now have $(x,y)=(a,b)$, so $h$ is injective.</p>

"
"2392774","2392825","<p>Here's a counterexample.  Let $X$ be a countably infinite set and choose a partition $$X=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} A_n\cup \bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} B_n\cup\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} C_n$$ where each $A_n,B_n,$ and $C_n$ is infinite.  Consider the topology on $X$ generated by the sets $A_n$, $A_n\cup B_n$, and $C_n$ for all $n$.  Note that $X$ is not homogeneous: for instance, if $x\in X$, then there exists a point $y\in X$ such that $x\in\overline{\{y\}}$ but $y\not\in\overline{\{x\}}$ if and only if $x\in B_n$ for some $n$ (in which case you can take $y$ to be any point of $A_n$).  However, I claim all the neighborhood spaces of $X$ are homeomorphic.</p>

<p>Fix points $a\in A_0$, $b\in B_0$, and $c\in C_0$.  Note that there are homeomorphisms of $X$ sending $a$ to any point in any $A_n$, or sending $b$ to any point in any $B_n$, or sending $c$ to any point in any $C_n$.  So it suffices to show that $N(a)$, $N(b)$, and $N(c)$ are homeomorphic.</p>

<p>First, we construct a homeomorphism $f:N(a)\to N(c)$.  We take $f$ to be any bijection $X\to X$ such that $f(A_0)=C_0$, $f(B_0)=C_1$, $f(A_n)=A_{n-1}$ for all $n&gt;0$, $f(B_n)=B_{n-1}$ for all $n&gt;0$, and $f(C_n)=C_{n+2}$ for all $n$.  Note that $f$ fails to be a homeomorphism $X\to X$ only because $B_0$ is not open but $f(B_0)=C_1$ is open.  However, $f$ is a homeomorphism $N(a)\to N(c)$, since to get an open set in $N(a)$ you must add in $A_0$ and $A_0\cup B_0$ is open.</p>

<p>Now we construct a homeomorphism $N(b)\to N(c)$.  We take $f$ to be any bijection $X\to X$ such that $f(A_0\cup B_0)=C_0$, $f(A_n)=A_{n-1}$ for all $n&gt;0$, $f(B_n)=B_{n-1}$ for all $n&gt;0$, and $f(C_n)=C_{n+1}$ for all $n$.  Such an $f$ fails to be a homeomorphism $X\to X$ only because $A_0$ is open but $f(A_0)$ (which is half of $C_0$) is not open.  This problem goes away when you consider $f$ as a map $N(b)\to N(c)$, since you must add $B_0$ to $A_0$ to get an open set in $N(b)$ and $f(A_0\cup B_0)$ is open.</p>

<hr>

<p>However, there are no Hausdorff counterexamples.  In fact, something stronger is true:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space, $a,b\in X$, and $f:N(a)\to N(b)$ be a homeomorphism.  Then $f(a)=b$ and $f$ is also a homeomorphism as a map $X\to X$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, $a$ is the unique point of $N(a)$ that is contained in all nonempty open sets and similarly for $b$ in $N(b)$, so $f(a)=b$.  To prove $f:X\to X$ is a homeomorphism, it suffices to show $f$ is continuous, since the same reasoning will show $f^{-1}$ is continuous as well.</p>

<p>Suppose $U\subseteq X$ is open.  If $b\in U$, then $U$ is open in $N(b)$, so $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $N(a)$ and hence in $X$.  So we may assume $b\not\in U$.  Let $x\in f^{-1}(U)$.  Since $b\not\in U$, $x\neq a$.</p>

<p>Since $X$ is Hausdorff, there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $a$ in $X$ whose closure does not contain $x$.  Since $V$ is open in $N(a)$, $f(V)$ is open in $N(b)$ and hence in $X$. Now observe that $U\cup f(V)$ is open in $N(b)$, and therefore $f^{-1}(U\cup f(V))=f^{-1}(U)\cup V$ is open in $N(a)$ and hence in $X$.  Therefore $(f^{-1}(U)\cup V)\setminus \overline{V}=f^{-1}(U)\setminus\overline{V}$ is also open in $X$ (here the closure is computed in $X$).  By our choice of $V$, $x\in f^{-1}(U)\setminus\overline{V}$.  Thus $f^{-1}(U)\setminus\overline{V}$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ in $X$ which is contained in $f^{-1}(U)$.</p>

<p>Since $x\in f^{-1}(U)$ was arbitrary, this proves that $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$.  Thus $f$ is continuous from $X$ to $X$, as desired.</p>
"
"2392775","2392785","<p>Yes, as you say understanding the image of just the boundary line is easy if you take it as a given that $1/z$ maps lines not through the origin to circles that pass through the origin. Then, since a circle is determined by three points, you know that the image of the boundary is the circle containing the origin, $z = 1/3$, and $z = -2i/3$ (the latter two points come from looking at where $1/z$ sends the intercepts). </p>

<p>Your description of the image of the entire region as adding up the images of a bunch of lines is essentially the correct way to think about it. If you want to do it algebraically though then notice that if we write 
$$1/z = u + iv$$
with $z = x+iy$ then 
$$u = \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2},\quad v = \frac{-y}{x^2+y^2}.$$ 
Since $1/z$ is its own inverse we then get the relations
$$x = \frac{u}{u^2 + v^2},\quad y = \frac{-v}{u^2+v^2}.$$ 
So, to understand the image of our region
$$x + 2y &gt; 3$$
in the $u,v$ plane we can just plug in to obtain
$$\frac{u}{u^2+v^2} -2\frac{v}{u^2 + v^2} &gt; 3.$$
If you manipulate this inequality and plug through the algebra (complete the square...) then you should find that the image is the interior of a circle. In particular, it will be the interior of the circle that is the image of the boundary.</p>

<p>Let $\ell = \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ be the space of real sequences indexed by natural numbers. Let $R : \ell \to \ell$ be the operator on $\ell$ which shift  a sequence to the right. More precisely, for any real sequence $a = (a_n)$, $R(a)$ is the sequence with entries $R(a)_n = a_{n+1}$. One property of $R$ is if $a_n$ is a polynomial in $n$ of degree $m$, then $(R-1)(a) = R(a) - a$ is a polynomial in $n$ of degree $m-1$. </p>

<p>$$(R-1)^4(T) = R^4(T) - 4R^3(T) + 6R^2(T) - 4R(T) + T = 0$$</p>

<p>Equivalently, this means $T_n$ satisfies a recurrence relation of the from</p>

<p>$$T_{n+4} - 4T_{n+3} + 6T_{n+2} - 4T_{n+1} + T_n = 0$$</p>

<p>As an example, the recurrence relation in $(*1)$ is constructed using the polynomial
$$\begin{align}
q(x) = &amp; (x^8-1)(x^4-1)(x^2-1)(x-1)\\

I hope the pattern is obvious.</p>

<p>This means same thing happens to $L = 6$.  Since every even integer $L \ge 4$ can be rewritten as a non-negative combination of $4$ and $6$. We can combine these two sets of recurrence relations to conclude whenever $L \ge 4$ is even, there are infinite many pairs of $L$-tuples which sum to same number.</p>

which sums to same number.</p>

<p>$$T_{24}+T_{18}+T_{3} = 3750 = T_{19} + T_{23} + T_{8}$$</p>

<p>Since every odd $L \ge 7$ can be written as $3$ plus some non-trivial non-negative combinations of $4$ and $6$. It is easy to see for any odd $L \ge 7$, there are also infinitely many pairs of $L$-tuple which sum to same number.</p>

"2392790","2392815","<p>Depending on what you are looking for, I would suggest different resources. I will assume that you have a basic knowledge of functions, sets and relations, and thus do not need a basic reference on those.</p>

<p>A good way to start is by reading some classic books: ""Algebra"" by Grove, ""Topology"" by Munkres and ""Calculus"" by Spivak provide the very basics that you should know, and more. Probably all of them are available at your local library. Even if they are only three, they will take you some time to read, even more to master, and do not even cover what a freshman should know in his first year. If you feel ambitious, consider: ""Linear Algebra done right"" by Axler, ""Algebra I, II, III"" by Cohn (I believe the modern editions have different names, but the content from the old editions is priceless), ""Calculus I, II"" by Apostol, ""Complex Analysis"" by Ahlfors, ""A fisrst course in Algebraic Topology"" by Kosniowski and ""Ordinary Differential Equations"" by Tenenbaum and Pollard. This is by no means a comprehensive list, but it will get you started: most of the above listed are books that you can use as an initiate and carry through most of your learning.</p>

<p>For further reading, with some time of getting familiar with books in the area, you will recognize most of the publishers that provide great advanced mathematical content, some of them being <a href=""http://www.springer.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Springer-Verlag</a> (with their characteristic yellow and white books), <a href=""http://www.cambridge.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cambridge University Press</a>, <a href=""http://www.wiley.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wiley</a> and <a href=""http://press.princeton.edu"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Princeton University Press</a>: just look at the references that the books above give.</p>

<p>Nowadays there are multiple sources of reliable Mathematics online (including Stack Exchange), and a lot of Professors post their notes free of charge on their websites: Terence Tao has <a href=""https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/linear-algebra-notes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Linear Algebra notes</a>, Sergei Treil posted his <a href=""https://www.math.brown.edu/~treil/papers/LADW/book.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">exceptional parody</a> of one of the books above mentioned and Keith Conrad has <a href=""http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">expository papers</a> that cover a wide array of subjects, not to mention the multiple Universities that provide free content through their websites, like the <a href=""https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MIT</a>, I also suggest you skim through them.</p>

<p>However, in Mathematics the most important thing is to do your own work, to get involved and to try and solve problems. You may find that you understand a concept or even that you feel that you know everything about a particular one. Do not be fooled, if you have not done any exercises or problems (you don't have to look for them, almost every single Mathematics book will leave proofs to the reader and have exercises at the end of the chapter), your knowledge is not cemented and the base you are building will be weak and crumble when more complex concepts appear. Make sure that for every hour that you spend reading, you put another hour into problem solving.</p>

Since $V$ is finite, the usual pigeonhole argument implies $(f^{-1}g)^n(v_0)=v_0$ for some $n&gt;0$ and $v_0\in V$. Now define a new map $h:V\to U$ given by
$$
  h(v)=\begin{cases}
    g(v)&amp;\text{if }v=(f^{-1}g)^i(v_0)\text{ for some }i,\\
    f(v)&amp;\text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
$$
Note that $(v,h(v))$ is an edge for all $v\in V$. Also $h(v_0)=g(v_0)\neq f(v_0)$. Finally consider any $u\in U$. If $f^{-1}(u)=(f^{-1}g)^i(v_0)$ for some $i$ then
$$
  u=f\left((f^{-1}g)^{n+i}(v_0)\right)
    =g\left((f^{-1}g)^{n+i-1}(v_0)\right)
    =h\left((f^{-1}g)^{n+i-1}(v_0)\right).
$$
Otherwise $u=f(f^{-1}(u))=h(f^{-1}(u))$. Thus $h$ is surjective, so it is a complete matching of $G$ distinct from $f$, contradicting the hypothesis.</p>

<p>Now, since the input for the function is only two vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, we can always, without loss of generality, rotate our coordinates such that $\mathbf{x}$ lies along the first coordinate, that is,</p>

<p>$\mathbf{x} = (\Vert\mathbf{x}\Vert,0,\ldots,0).$</p>

<p>Now, in our integral we integrate over an $m$-dimensional vector $\mathbf{w}$. However, since the integrand only depends on $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ through the scalar products $\mathbf{w\cdot x}$ and $\mathbf{w\cdot y}$, the last $m-2$ components of $\mathbf{w}$ are irrelevant; the scalar products do not care about the last $m-2$ components, since they are all zero for $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$.</p>

"2392823","2392859","<p>One way, but perhaps not the most enlightening way, is just to calculate $\phi(g)$ for every $g \in C_8 = \langle x\rangle$.</p>

<p>So:</p>

<p>$\phi(e) = \phi(x^0) = (y^3)^0 = y^0 = e'\\
\phi(x) = y^3\\
\phi(x^2) = [\phi(x)]^2 = (y^3)^2 = y^6 = e'\\
\phi(x^3) = (y^3)^3 = y^9 = y^6y^3 = y^3\\
\phi(x^4) = (y^3)^4 = y^{12} = (y^6)^2 = (e')^2 = e'\\
\phi(x^5) = (y^3)^5 = y^{15} = y^{12}y^3 = y^3\\
\phi(x^6) = (y^3)^6 = y^{18} = (y^6)^3 = (e')^3 = e'\\
\phi(x^7) = (y^3)^7 = y^{21} = y^{18}y^3 = y^3.$</p>

<p>This makes it clear that $\text{ker }\phi = \{e,x^2,x^4,x^6\}$, and $\text{im }\phi = \{e',y^3\}$. So that gives us the answer, but it doesn't give any clues as to how we might find the answer with different cyclic groups.</p>

<p>If we attempt to use your approach to find the kernel, we have:</p>

<p>$\phi(x^k) = e' \implies y^{3k} = e' \implies 6|3k$.</p>

<p>So this gives us $2|k$, that is, $k$ must be even. But that is only <em>half</em> the story: although we now know with confidence:</p>

<p>$\text{ker }\phi \subseteq \{e,x^2,x^4,x^6\}$, we haven't established that the kernel isn't actually <em>smaller</em> than this set.</p>

<p>However, if we know that a kernel is a subgroup (which you should know), and that any subgroup of a cyclic group is <em>also</em> cyclic, we have three choices for the kernel:</p>

<p>$\{e\} (= \langle e\rangle)\\
\{e,x^4\} (= \langle x^4\rangle)\\
\{e,x^2,x^4,x^6\} = (\langle x^2\rangle).$</p>

<p>You have wisely eliminated the first possibility, by noting $\phi$ is not injective (since $8 &gt; 6$). The answer above shows you $x^2 \in \text{ker }\phi$, which then settles the matter.</p>

<p>From our determination of the kernel, we know exactly half the elements of $C_8$ are mapped to the identity of $C_6$. So the image (which is a subgroup of $C_6$) has at least two elements, and therefore is either:</p>

<p>$\{e',y^3\} = \langle y^3\rangle$, $\{e',y^2,y^4\} = \langle y^2\rangle$, or $C_6$.</p>

<p>Since $y^3 = \phi(x) \in \text{im }\phi$, the second option is out. Since we can write , for any <em>odd</em>  $k$, $k = 2t+1$,</p>

<p>it is clear that for such an odd $k$:</p>

<p>$\phi(x^k) = \phi(x^{2t+1}) = \phi(x^{2t})\phi(x) = \phi((x^2)^t)\phi(x) = [\phi(x^2)]^t\phi(x) = (e')^t\phi(x) = \phi(x) = y^3$.</p>

<p>Note that:</p>

<p>$|\text{im }\phi| = 2 = \dfrac{8}{4} = \dfrac{|C_8|}{|\text{ker }\phi|}$. This is no accident. It is also no accident that $C_8$ splits cleanly into those elements that map to $e'$, and those that map to $y^3$ (and that each such set has exactly the same size-because these are <em>cosets</em>).</p>

The compactness of the resolvent gives an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions, which are provably in the Schwartz space, and which are <em>orthogonal</em> in every $H^k$ (these are Hermite polynomials times a suitable Gaussian). </p>

<p>Then it is true that $f\in H^k$ (with $k\ge 0$) has an expansion in $H^k$, and an expansion in $L^2$.

<p>In your first equation, $\hom_k(A,\hom_{\bar k}(\bar k,\bar k))$ doesn't make sense since $\hom_{\bar k}(\bar k,\bar k)$ is not a $k$-algebra, but the conclusion
$$
  \hom_{\bar k}(A\otimes_k \bar k,\bar k)\cong\hom_k(A,\bar k)

is correct. Secondly, in general
$$
  \hom_k(A\times B,C)\neq\hom_k(A,C)\times\hom_k(B,C).
$$
Indeed given $f:A\to C$ and $g:B\to C$, if we try to define $h:A\times B\to C$ by $h(a,b)=f(a)+g(b)$, we'll run into trouble because
$$
  h((a_1,b_1)(a_2,b_2))=h(a_1a_2,b_1b_2)=f(a_1)f(a_2)+g(b_1)g(b_2)

  h(a_1,b_1)h(a_2,b_2)=(f(a_1)+g(b_1))(f(a_2)+g(b_2)).

  f(1,0)f(0,1)=f((1,0)(0,1))=f((0,0))=0,

$$
  f(1,0)+f(0,1)=f((1,1))=1.
$$
The first equation gives $f(1,0)=0$ or $f(0,1)=0$, and the second gives $f(0,1)=1$ or $f(1,0)=1$ respectively. In the first case define $g:B\to k$ by $g(b)=f(0,b)$. Then
$$
  f(a,b)=f((a,0)(1,0)+(0,b)(0,1))=f(a,0)\cdot0+g(b)\cdot1=g(b),

First of all, note that the polynomial equation $(0)$  will also hold for all  $x\in\Bbb C$.
If $f$ is a polynomial and $z\in\Bbb C$,  let $v_f(z)$ denote the order of $z$ as root of $f$. So $v_f(z)=0$ for almost all $z$ and  $\sum_{z\in\Bbb C}v_f(z)=\deg f$.</p>

<p>Let $n=\deg P$, $m=\deg Q$.
As we are interested only in non-constant $P$, we can assume $n&gt;0$.
The degree of $P\circ Q$ is $nm$, that of $P^{N}$ is $Nn$. We conclude that $m=N$.</p>

<p>From $(0)$ we see that for $\alpha\in\Bbb C$ and $\beta:=Q(\alpha)$,
$$\tag2 N\cdot {v_P(\alpha)} = v_P(Q(\alpha))\cdot v_{Q-\beta}(\alpha).$$
For $\alpha$ that maximizes $v_P$ (in particular, $v_P(\alpha)&gt;0$), $(2)$ implies $v_{Q-\beta}\ge N$.
Thus $Q-\beta$ is a multiple of $(X-\alpha)^N$, i.e., 
$$\tag3Q(X)=b(X-\alpha)^N+\beta$$
with $\alpha,\beta,b\in\Bbb C$, $b\ne0$.
Then $\alpha$ is the only root of the derivative $Q'(X)=Nb(X-\alpha)^{N-1}$, hence $Q(X)-w$ with $w\ne \beta$ has $N$ distinct, simple roots and at most one of these equals $\beta$. 
Accordingly,  let $w^*$ be a root of $Q(X)-w$ with $w^*\ne\beta$.
Adapting $(2)$, we find $Nv_P(w^*)=v_P(w)$.
By infinite descent, we find that $v_P(w)=0$ for all $w\ne\beta$. In other words, 
$$\tag4P(X)=a(X-\beta)^n$$ for some $a\ne 0$.</p>

<p>Then $\beta$ is the <em>only</em> root of $P(X)^{N}$, hence the only root of $Q(X)-\beta$. Therefore  $\beta=\alpha$. By a quick comparison of leading coefficients, we arrive at $(1)$.
$\square$</p>

<p><em>Remark:</em> If we know that $P,Q$ have real coefficients, then of course $a,b,\beta$ are real.</p>

For each digit $k$ there are $(n-1)^{n+r}$ sequences which don't contain $k$, so subtract those off (that is, subtract $\binom n1(n-1)^{n+r}$, since there are $\binom n1$ choices of $k$). Unfortunately we've now subtracted off the sequences that don't contain $k_1$ or $k_2$ twice, so we need to add those on again. Continuing in this manner we get
$$\sum_{a=0}^{n-1}(-1)^a\binom na(n-a)^{n+r},$$

"
"2392992","2393688","<p>It is a rule of thumb, but there are some estimates backing that rule.</p>

<p>Given a matrix $A∈ℝ^{n×n}$ and a vector $b∈ℝ^n$ the linear equation system ought to be solved is $$Ax=b.$$
Now we have perturbation in both $A$ and $b$, e.g. measurement errors in the rhs or integration errors in $A$ (thinking about FEM for PDEs). So actually we solve the perturbed system 
$$\tilde{A}x=\tilde{b},$$
with $\tilde{A}=A+δA$, and $\tilde{b}=b+δb$, with the perturbation $δA,\ δb$.</p>

<p>The measure of how $x$ and $\tilde{x}=x+δx$ are related is the relative error 
$$\frac{\|x-\tilde{x}\|}{\|x\|}=\frac{\|δx\|}{\|x\|}.$$
In the following there are two intermediate results, which lead to the desired estimate.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Perturbation of $b$:</strong></p>

<p>Let $\tilde{x}=x+δx$ be the solution of the perturbed equation system $A\tilde{x}=\tilde{b}$, then it holds 
$$\frac{\|δx\|}{\|x\|}\leqslant \text{cond}(A)\frac{\|δb\|}{\|b\|}.$$
The condition number of $A$ is defined as $\text{cond}(A)=\|A\|\|A^{-1}\|$.</p>

<p>So the relative error in the solution can be estimated by the relative error in the rhs amplified with the condition number. Since that proof is quite simple I will state it for completeness. </p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> It is $$δx=\tilde{x}-x = A^{-1}(A\tilde{x}-Ax)=A^{-1}(\tilde{b}-b)=A^{-1}δb$$
Hence, we get
$$\frac{\|δx\|}{\|x\|}\leqslant\|A^{-1}\|\frac{\|δb\|}{\|x\|}\frac{\|b\|}{\|b\|} =\|A^{-1}\|\frac{\|δb\|}{\|b\|}\frac{\|Ax\|}{\|b\|} \leqslant\|A^{-1}\|\|A\|\frac{\|δb\|}{\|b\|}.$$</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Perturbation of $A$:</strong></p>

<p>If $\|δA\|&lt;\|A^{-1}\|^{-1}$ then it holds
$$\frac{\|δx\|}{\|x\|}\leqslant \frac{\text{cond}(A)}{1-\text{cond}(A)\|δA\|/\|A\|}\frac{\|δA\|}{\|A\|}.$$
with $\tilde{x}=x+δx$ the solution of the perturbed system $\tilde{A}x=b$.</p>

<p>That proof is a bit more involved and need a lemma, so I will skip it here. The condition $\|δA\|&lt;…$ ensures regularity of $\tilde{A}$. (Note: Not sure if $&lt;$ or $\leqslant$.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Combining both results</strong></p>

<p>Given the requirements of the theorem about perturbation in $A$ it holds 
$$\frac{\|δx\|}{\|x\|}\leqslant \frac{\text{cond}(A)}{1-\text{cond}(A)\|δA\|/\|A\|}\left(\frac{\|δb\|}{\|b\|}+\frac{\|δA\|}{\|A\|}\right),$$
with $\tilde{x}$ being the solution of the system $\tilde{A}\tilde{x}=\tilde{b}$.</p>

<p>Again I skip the proof. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Remark</strong></p>

<p>Note that you can ignore the denominator: 
$$\frac{\text{cond}(A)}{1-\text{cond}(A)\|δA\|/\|A\|} \approx \text{cond}(A),$$</p>

<p>That is because we hat the condition above, that $δA&lt;\|A^{-1}\|^{-1}.$ So the denominator is just some small factor $c$.</p>

<p>So you get an estimate, like in your question.
$$\frac{\|δx\|}{\|x\|}\leqslant [c\cdot]\text{cond}(A)\left(\frac{\|δb\|}{\|b\|}+\frac{\|δA\|}{\|A\|}\right)$$</p>

<p>So you can use that to estimate the error propagation from data to solution. But you should keep in mind, that the theorems state estimates from above. So replacing $""\leqslant""$ with $""\approx""$ will give you a very negative result. The math in physics is usually not that bad. </p>

<p>What you can see, when dealing with ill-conditioned problems, is that iterative solvers have a hard time converging. They will usually take a lot more steps to achieve an improvement of the solution guess. 
Here you can <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preconditioner"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">precondition</a> your system to improve convergence. 
I personally only had one (real world) problem that I could not solve due to conditioning.</p>

On the other hand the following integral is quite easy,
$$\int_{[-1, 1]^2}\frac{e^{x^2}}{e^{x^2} + e^{y^2}}dxdy +\int_{[-1, 1]^2}\frac{e^{y^2}}{e^{x^2} + e^{y^2}}dxdy.$$</p>

<p>The missing negative sign  on the LHS of the above line is your first error.</p>

<p>Your second error is writing $\cos \frac {\alpha}{2}=\sqrt {\frac {1+\cos \alpha}{2}}\;.$ We have $|\cos \frac {\alpha}{2}|=\sqrt {   \frac {1+\cos \alpha}{2}   }\;.\;$.... If $450^o&lt;\alpha&lt;340^o$ then $225^o&lt;\frac {\alpha}{2}&lt;270^o,$ implying $\cos \frac {\alpha}{2}&lt;0.$</p>

<p>In general if $\cot x=\frac {a}{b}$ then the proportion of $\cos^2 x$ to $\sin^2 x$  is $a^2$ to $b^2$, so let $\cos^2 x=a^2y$ and $\sin^2 x=b^2y$. Since $1=\cos^2 x +\sin^2 x$, we have $y=a^2+b^2$, so $\cos^2 x =\frac {a^2}{a^2+b^2}$ and $\sin^2 x =\frac {b^2}{a^2+b^2}\;$ and therefore  $\;|\cos x|=\frac {|a|}{\sqrt {a^2+b^2}}$ and $|\sin x|=\frac {|b|}{\sqrt {a^2+b^2}}.$</p>

<p>So if $\cot \alpha =\frac {-7}{24}$ and $\cos \alpha&lt;0$ then $\cos \alpha =-\frac {7}{\sqrt {7^2+24^2}}=-\frac {7}{25}.$</p>

<p>Since $AB = AC$, the line $AO$ is the orthogonal bisector of segment $BC$. Choose point $E$ on the line $AO$ (and inside the triangle $ABC$) so that $\angle \, BCE = 60^{\circ}$. </p>

<p>Then, by construction, triangle $BCE$ is equilateral. Thus, $$\angle \, ABE = \angle\, ABC - \angle \, CBE = 80^{\circ} - 60^{\circ} = 20^{\circ}$$
 $$\angle \, ACE = \angle\, ACB - \angle \, BCE = 80^{\circ} - 60^{\circ} = 20^{\circ}$$ However, since $O$ is the circumcenter of $ABC$ we know that $OA - OB = OC$ and $\angle \, BOA = 2 \, \angle \, BCA = 160^{\circ}$ which means that $\angle \, ABO = 10^{\circ}$ and that $$\angle \, EBO = \angle \, ABE - \angle \, ABO = 20^{\circ} - 10^{\circ} = 10^{\circ}$$ Therefore, $BO$ is the angle bisector of $\angle \, ABE$ and by the angle bisector theorem
$$\frac{AO}{OE} = \frac{AB}{BE} = \frac{AB}{BC}$$ because $BE = BC \,$ (triangle $BCE$ is equilateral). However, $BD$ is the angle bisector of angle $\angle \, ABC$ so again by the angle bisector theorem
$$\frac{AD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{BC}$$ Thus
$$\frac{AO}{OE} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{AD}{DC}$$ which by Thales' intercept theorem implies that $DO$ is parallel to $CE$. Consequently, 
$$\angle \, ADO = \angle \, ACE = 20^{\circ}$$ and by angle chasing $\angle \, BDO = 100^{\circ}$.</p>

"2393104","2397862","<p>Assume ${\bf F}$ as given, and assume that the upper hemisphere $S: \&gt;x^2+y^2+z^2=1,\ z\geq0$ is oriented upwards. The surface $S$ has a boundary cycle $\partial S$ which is the unit circle in the $(x,y)$-plane, oriented counterclockwise.</p>

<p>We are told to compute the flux integral
$$\Phi:=\int_S{\rm curl}({\bf F})\cdot{\bf n}\&gt;d\omega\ .\tag{1}$$
This computation can be performed in three ways:</p>

<p>(i) Compute ${\bf C}:={\rm curl}({\bf F})$ as a function  of $x$, $y$, $z$, use the parametric representation
$${\bf r}(\phi,\theta):=\bigl(\cos\theta\cos\phi,\cos\theta\sin\phi,\sin\theta\bigr)$$
($\phi$ and $\theta$ are GPS coordinates) for $S$ and compute the surface integral as given:
$$\Phi=\int_0^{\pi/2}\int_0^{2\pi}{\bf C}\bigl({\bf r}(\phi,\theta)\bigr)\cdot\bigl({\bf r}_\phi\times{\bf r}_\theta)\&gt;d\phi\&gt;d\theta\ .$$
(ii) Use Stokes' theorem to convert $(1)$ into a line integral along $\partial S$; then compute this line integral:
$$\Phi=\int_{\partial S}{\bf F}\cdot d{\bf r}\ .\tag{2}$$ Going this way you don't even have to compute ${\bf C}$, but you need to parametrize $\partial S$:
$${\bf r}(\phi)=(\cos\phi,\sin\phi,0)$$
and plug this into $(2)$.</p>

<p>(iii) You have chosen a third way, namely using Gauss' theorem. This theorem deals with a three-dimensional solid $B$ and its boundary surface $\partial B$. We define $B$ to be the half ball bounded by  $S$ and the unit disc $U$ in the $(x,y)$-plane oriented downwards. Gauss' theorem then gives
$$\int_{\partial B}{\bf C}\cdot{\bf n}\&gt;d\omega=\int_B{\rm div}({\bf C})\&gt;{\rm dvol}=0\ ,$$
since ${\rm div}\circ{\rm  curl}=0$. From $\partial B=S+U$ it follows that
$$\Phi=-\int_U {\bf C}\cdot{\bf n}\&gt;{\rm d}(x,y)=\int_U C_3(x,y,0){\rm d}(x,y)\ .$$

"2393141","2393553","<p>Your interpretation in (a) seems fine. Once you reject $H_0$ that all
population means are equal, the next task is to investigate what the
pattern of differences may be.</p>

<p>Specifically, part (b) investigates whether $\mu_L = \mu_M$ by looking
at a CI for the difference $\mu_L - \mu_M.$ The assumption of the ANOVA
in (a) is that all three populations have the same variance. Still assuming
the Low and Medium populations have the same variance, a 95% confidence interval (CI) based on
a two-sample ""pooled"" t procedure is $(-2.296,  6.581),$ as computed in
R statistical software below. (You can verify this by hand using a formula
in your text, or by using MATLAB.)</p>

<p>Because the CI contains $0,$ we conclude that
a $0$ difference (i.e. equal means) is believable. Also, from the output
below, the P-value for a two-sample pooled t test is about $0.31 &gt; 0.05,$
so we cannot reject $H_0: \mu_L = \mu_M.$ </p>

<pre><code>Low = c(31,36,34,37,39,34,33)
Med = c(36,31,39,32,36,30,25)

        Two Sample t-test

data:  Low and Med
t = 1.0519, df = 12, p-value = 0.3136
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
-2.295540  6.581254
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
 34.85714  32.71429 
</code></pre>

<p>If you were do do all three possible comparisons of pairs of means
from the original data, you would have three comparisons. If each comparison
is made at the 5% level, then there is some doubt what the overall
error probability is. There are several kinds of <em>multiple comparison procedures</em>
for dealing with situations. Some names are 'Fisher LSD', 'Tukey HSD', and
'Bonferroni'. I suppose this may be the next topic in your course.</p>

<p>The Bonferroni method is to do each of the three tests at level $\alpha = .05/3 = .017.$ (Or each of three CIs at confidence level 98.3%.) This ensures that
the overall error probability is not greater than 5%.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> If you are comparing levels Med and High it would be best to use a
Welch ('separate-variances') two-sample procedure because failure of the equal-variance assumption
can be especially dangerous when group sample sizes are unequal. To get
the Welch CI in R, omit the argument <code>var.eq</code> to obtain the 95% CI $(0.164, 11.265),$ which does <em>not</em> contain $0;$ the P-value for testing $H_0: \mu_M = \mu_H$ against the two sided alternative is $0.045 &lt; .05,$ so you could reject
at the 5% level.</p>

<p>Let us prove that $(\mathbb{R}, d)$ is complete.
Namely, let $(x_n)\subset\mathbb{R}$ be a Cauchy sequence. 
Given $\epsilon\in (0,1)$, let $\eta := \epsilon / (1-\epsilon)$, so that
$\eta/(1+\eta) = \epsilon$. Since $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence, there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
$$
d(x_j, x_k) &lt; \eta,

$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{|x_j - x_k|}{1+|x_j-x_k|} &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}
\qquad \forall j,k\geq N.
$$
Since the function $t\mapsto t/(1+t)$ is strictly increasing in $[0,+\infty)$,
the last condition is equivalent to
$$
|x_j - x_k| &lt; \epsilon
\qquad \forall j,k\geq N.
$$
In other words, we have proved that $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(\mathbb{R}, |\cdot|)$.
Since $(\mathbb{R}, |\cdot|)$ is complete, the sequence $(x_n)$ is convergent in 
$(\mathbb{R}, |\cdot|)$, i.e. there exists $x\in\mathbb{R}$ such that
$$
\lim_{n\to +\infty} |x_n - x| = 0.

"
"2393227","2393639","<p>The following is partly educated guessing, but it fits.
Basically it is just about interpreting everything carefully. Here comes the TL; DR; -version.</p>

<p>Assuming that:</p>

<ul>
<li>$x\in V=\Bbb{F}_2^8$ and $\phi:V\to V$,</li>
<li>In the sum $x\oplus a$ the integer $a$ is transformed to an element of $V$ by using the base-2 digits as components. So if $a=\sum_{i=0}^7a_i2^i, a_i\in\{0,1\}$, and $x=(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_7)\in V$, then
$$x\oplus a=(x_0+a_0,x_1+a_1,\ldots,x_7+a_7),$$ where here the sums of the components are sums in $\Bbb{F}_2$.</li>
<li>If $n\in\{0,1,2,\ldots,7\}$ the operator $D_{2^n}$ is defined as follows. If $g:V\to V$, then $D_{2^n}(g):V\to V$ is the function defined by
$$D_{2^n}(g):x\mapsto g(x\oplus 2^n)-g(x).$$
Of course, in $V$ subtraction = addition, so instead of a difference we can use a sum just as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this definition we do get the formula 
$$
D_1D_2D_4D_8(g):x\mapsto \sum_{a=0}^{15}g(x\oplus a).
$$
This is just a manifestation of the fact that, when viewed as above, the set
$W=\{0,1,2,\ldots,15\}$ is a subgroup of $V$. It is actually a subspace spanned by the linearly independent elements $1$, $2$, $4$ and $8$.</p>

<p>To see this we first observe that
$$
D_1(g):x\mapsto g(x\oplus1)+g(x)=\sum_{a=0}^1g(x\oplus a).
$$
Then
$$
\begin{aligned}
D_1D_2(g):x&amp;\mapsto D_2(g)(x\oplus1)+D_2(g)(x)\\
&amp;=\left(g((x\oplus1)\oplus2)+g(x\oplus1)\right)+\left(g(x\oplus2)+g(x)\right)\\
&amp;=g(x\oplus3)+g(x\oplus1)+g(x\oplus2)+g(x)\\
&amp;=\sum_{a=0}^3g(x\oplus a).
\end{aligned}
$$
Repeating the dose
$$
\begin{aligned}
D_1D_2D_4(g):x&amp;\mapsto \sum_{a=0}^3D_4(g)(x\oplus a)\\
&amp;=\sum_{a=0}^3\big(g(x\oplus a\oplus4)+g(x\oplus a)\big)\\
&amp;=\sum_{a=0}^7g(x\oplus a).
\end{aligned}
$$
And one more repetition then gives the claim.</p>

<p>To understand why $D_{2^n}$ are called derivations we need to break the functions into components. Any function $g:V\to V$ can be written using the
components
$$
g(x)=(g_0(x),g_1(x),\ldots,g_7(x)),
$$
where the components $g_i:V\to\Bbb{F}_2$ are all boolean functions in the variables $x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_7$. Any such boolean function can be uniquely written as a polynomial in the unknowns $x_i$ ranging over $\Bbb{F}_2$. Remember that we only need to use terms $x_{i_1}x_{i_2}\cdots x_{i_k}$ with
$i_1&lt;i_2&lt;\cdots&lt;i_k$ because the polynomials $x_i^2$ and $x_i$ give the same boolean function.</p>

<p>We obviously have
$$
g_i(x\oplus 2^n)=g_i(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1},x_n+1,x_{n+1},\ldots,x_7).\tag{1}
$$ 
The following observation is the key:
$$
D_{2^n}(g_i)(x)=\frac{\partial g_i}{\partial x_n}(x).\tag{2}

Everything in sight is linear, so it suffices to prove $(2)$ for each monomial $g_i(x)=x_{i_1}x_{i_2}\cdots x_{i_k}$. Here if $n$ does not appear among the indices $i_1,\ldots, i_k$ we have, by $(1)$, $g_i(x\oplus2^n)=g_i(x)$ for all $x\in V$. In this case we have the constant function zero on both sides of $(2)$. </p>

<p>On the other hand, if $i_t=n$, then
$$
\begin{aligned}
D_{2^n}(g_i)(x)&amp;=g_i(x\oplus2^n)+g_i(x)\\
&amp;=g_i(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n+1,\ldots,x_7)+g_i(x_0,\ldots,x_7)\\
&amp;=x_{i_1}\cdots (x_{i_t}+1)\cdots x_{i_k}+x_{i_1}x_{i_2}\cdots x_{i_k}\\
&amp;=x_{i_1}\cdots x_{i_{t-1}} x_{i_{t+1}}\cdots x_{i_k},

<p>So you're looking for the extreme values of $f(x,y,z) = x+2y+z$ for points $(x,y,z)$ located on the cylinder $\color{blue}{x^2+y^2=1}$ <strong>and</strong> on the plane $\color{red}{y+z=1}$; i.e. on their intersection. Introduce two Lagrange multipliers to limit the points to those on this intersection:
$$\begin{align}F(x,y,z,\lambda,\mu) &amp; = f(x,y,z)+\lambda \left( \color{blue}{x^2+y^2 -1} \right)+\mu \left( \color{red}{y+z -1} \right) \\
&amp; = x+2y+z+\lambda \left( \color{blue}{x^2+y^2 -1} \right)+\mu \left( \color{red}{y+z -1} \right)\end{align}$$ 
Now you solve the system:
$$\left\{ \begin{array}{rcl}
F_x = 0 \\
F_y = 0 \\
F_z = 0 \\
F_\lambda = 0 \\
F_\mu = 0

F_x = 0 \\
F_y = 0 \\
F_z = 0 \\

\end{array}\right. \iff \ldots$$</p>

<p>Can you proceed?</p>

<p>Addition after comments. In your notation with
$$\color{green}{p(x,y,z)=x+2y+z \implies \nabla p = \langle 1,2,1\rangle }$$
the function to be optimized and constraints
$$\color{blue}{j(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2-1 \implies \nabla j = \langle 2x,2y,0 \rangle}$$
and
$$\color{red}{k(x,y,z)=y+z-1 \implies \nabla k = \langle 0,1,1 \rangle}$$
the system becomes:

The adjugate of a linear map $T \colon V \rightarrow V$ is characterized by the property that it is the adjoint map to $\bigwedge^{d-1}(T)$ with respect to $\left&lt; \cdot, \cdot \right&gt;$. That is, we have</p>

<p>$$ \left&lt; \operatorname{adj}(T)v, \omega \right&gt; = \left&lt;v, \bigwedge\nolimits^{d-1}(T)\omega \right&gt; $$</p>

<p>for all $v \in V$ and $\omega \in \bigwedge^{d-1}(V)$. Using this definition, one can prove directly that 
$$\operatorname{adj}(T) \circ T = T \circ \operatorname{adj}(T) = \det(T) I$$
and
$$ \operatorname{adj}(\operatorname{adj}(T)) = \det(T)^{d-2} T. $$</p>

<p>I'll assume that $d$ is even and show that given any invertible map $S \colon \bigwedge^{d-1}(V) \rightarrow \bigwedge^{d-1}(V)$ we can find an invertible map $T \colon V \rightarrow V$ such that $\bigwedge^{d-1}(T) = S$. Since the pairing is perfect, there exists a (unique) map $R \colon V \rightarrow V$ which is adjoint to $S$ so that</p>

<p>$$ \left&lt; Rv, \omega \right&gt; = \left&lt; v, S\omega \right&gt; $$</p>

<p>for all $v \in V$ and $\omega \in \bigwedge^{d-1}(V)$. Note that $R$ must also be invertible. Define $T = \det(R)^{\frac{2-d}{d-1}}\operatorname{adj}(R)$. Then we have</p>

<p>$$ \operatorname{adj}(T) = \det(R)^{2 - d} \operatorname{adj}(\operatorname{adj}(R)) = \det(R)^{2-d} \det(R)^{d - 2} R = R $$</p>

"2393243","2393300","<p>I would check this page: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_probability_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_probability_space</a> ... See the first paragraph of the section verifying the standardness, which says that any probability measure on euclidean space is standard. </p>

<p>This means that any probability measure on euclidean space is isomorphic (up to null sets) to a disjoint union of an interval and a countable atomic measure. (Isomorphism here means in the category of measure spaces with measurable measure preserving maps. Up to null sets means that we are allowed to construct this isomorphism on the complement of sets of measure zero... this is written better on wikipedia.) </p>

<p>I think I can prove this but my argument below reflects the messy state of my mind right now. I'll try to clean it up and verify details after I get some sleep... </p>

<p>A strategy for proof would be to reduce it to the case of an interval (is it easy to show that the class of standard probability spaces is closed under products?* this is stated as true on wikipedia), and then use the cumulative density function to prove this in the case of the interval. (I see now that kimchilover is discussing this. The case of the interval is a pretty standard fact from measure theoretic probability courses, it should be done in detail in Durret, if I recall correctly.)</p>

<p>(*Ahout the case of products - applying the guaranteed decomposition into interval and atomic part to the factors and using distributivity of the product, this reduces to showing that the Lebesgue measure on $I^n$ is a standard probability space. This would follow from induction after proving the existence of a measure preserving map $I \to I^2$. I think you can produce one as a the limit of a sequence of maps $f_n : I \to I^2$, where $f_n$ breaks $I$ into $2^n$ pieces and puts them in $I^2$ in a checkerboard fashion, and $f_{n+1}$ refines $f_n$ so that there is a well defined pointwise limit.)</p>

<p>Given that, I think a yes to your question is immediate  - you replace the complex numbers with the interval $J$ and some atoms (after removing a null set), chop up your parametrizing  interval $[0,1]$ into two appropriately sized intervals $I_1$ and $I_2$, and use $I_2$ to produce the atoms (again by chopping it up into intervals), and parametrize $J$ with $I_1$.</p>

<p>
I'll assume that at the end of each round, the losing player pays the winning player a dollar amount equal to the winning player's score for that round.
<p>
For simplicity, I'll assume no score is awarded if Alice and Bob choose numbers which are equally close to the value of the roll.
<p>
Also, I'll assume the rules require Bob to choose a number <em>other</em> than the one already chosen by Alice.
<p>
Claim: Alice has the advantage and should always choose $16$.
<p>
Alice is trying to maximize not her expected score, but rather, the expected value of her score <em>minus</em> Bob's score.
<p>
With Alice choosing $16$, Bob's optimal reply is $15$, but for those choices, the expected value of Alice's score minus Bob's score is $+0.5$, so Alice will win more points, on average, than Bob.
<p>
If Alice chooses any number other than $16$, Bob has a reply which can force the expected value of Alice's score minus Bob's score to be negative, so in those cases, Bob will win more points, on average, than Alice.
<p>
If Alice chooses $16$, and Bob chooses any number other than $15$, the expected value of Alice's score minus Bob's score will be greater than $0.5$, so Bob's best choice is $15$, since it minimizes Bob's expected loss.
<p>
Optimal strategies for Bob:
<p>
If Alice chooses $k$ with $k &lt; 16$, Bob's best reply is $31-k$, which yields a positive expectation for Bob.
<p>
If Alice chooses $k$ with $k &gt; 16$, Bob's best reply is $k-1$, which yields a positive expectation for Bob.
<p>
Finally, if Alice chooses $16$, all choices by Bob yield a negative expectation for Bob, but to minimize the expected loss, Bob should choose $15$.

If Right moves he moves to $\frac 12$ and Left wins because this is greater than $0$.  If Left moves he goes to $*=\{0|0\}$ and Right moves and wins.

$$\tilde{\varphi}(ae)\left(\overline{ea'}\right) = (aeg)\left( \overline{ea'}\right) = g\left(\overline{ea'ae} \right) = g(0) = 0$$,
where the second to last equality follows from $ea'ae \in eA\text{rad}(Ae) = e\text{rad}(A)e = \text{rad}(eA)e \subseteq \text{rad}(eA)$, i.e. $\overline{ea'ae} = 0$. Therefore, $\tilde{\varphi}(ae) = 0$ and thus $\text{rad}(Ae) \subseteq \ker(\tilde{\varphi})$. Hence we get an $A$-linear map on the quotient
$$\varphi: Ae/\text{rad}(Ae) \to D(eA/\text{rad}(eA)), \ \overline{ae} \mapsto \tilde{\varphi}(ae) = aeg.$$ 
We are done if $\varphi \neq 0$. This is in fact the case, since $\varphi(\overline{e})(\overline{e}) = (eg)(\overline{e}) \neq 0$.</p>

"2393507","2393523","<p><strong>TL;DR version:</strong>  you are not taking rotation into account.  This is basically irrelevant in $\mathbb{R}$, but makes a huge difference in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d\ge 2$.</p>

<h3>In Detail:</h3>

<p>A contracting similitude can be characterized as a map
$$ S : \mathbb{R}^{d} \to \mathbb{R}^d $$
which takes the form
$$ S(\vec{x}) = c U \vec{x} + \vec{b}, $$
where $c \in (0,1)$ is the scaling ratio of $S$, $U$ is a unitary matrix (e.g. a rotation in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and $\vec{b}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is a translation.  In this language, the maps $S_1$ and $S_4$ which you describe can be written as
$$ S_1(\vec{x}) = \frac{1}{3} \vec{x}
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
S_4(\vec{x}) = \frac{1}{3} \vec{x} + \begin{bmatrix} \frac{2}{3} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}. $$
In each of these cases, the we can take $U = I$ to be the identity.  For the other two maps, you are going to need to rotate.  In general, we can describe a rotation by $\theta$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ by the matrix
$$
R_{\theta} := \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta) &amp; -\sin(\theta) \\
\sin(\theta) &amp; \cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix}.
$$
To get the piece of the von Koch curve that slopes up from left to right, we require a rotation of $\frac{\pi}{3}$, then a translation by $\frac{1}{3}$, which gives the map
$$ S_2(\vec{x})
 = \frac{1}{3} R_{\pi/3} \vec{x} + \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{3} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
 = \frac{1}{3} \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \vec{x} + \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{3} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.
$$
Finally, for the last piece of the curve, we will need to rotate by $-\frac{\pi}{3}$, translate right by $\frac{1}{2}$, and translate up by $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}$ (the origin gets mapped to the ""top"" of the snowflake, which is the vertex of an equilateral triangle sitting on the $x$-axis, centered at $x=\frac{1}{2}$, with sides of length $\frac{1}{3}$).  This gives
$$ S_3(\vec{x})
 = \frac{1}{3} R_{-\pi/3} \vec{x} + \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} \end{bmatrix}
 = \frac{1}{3} \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \vec{x}  + \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} \end{bmatrix}.

"2393534","2393716","<p>The surface level answer is that if $I[w]$ is a functional acting on an appropriate function space, the stationary points of the functional (defined appropriately) satisfies a PDE, namely the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Euler-Lagrange equations</a>. But you probably know that already.</p>

<hr>

<p>A lot of modern PDE theory is concerned with the existence, uniqueness and regularity of solutions. That is, given a particular PDE with initial/boundary conditions, we ask (a) whether a solution exists, (b) whether it is unique and (c) how 'regular' it is, for example how many times we can differentiate it. The important point is that we aren't interested in explicitly writing down a solution, provided we can prove it exists.</p>

<p>To do this, we usually use the following method:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define a sufficiently general space of functions $X$ and an appropriate notion for a function $u \in X$ to be a 'weak solution' to the equation. We then (often exploiting compactness properties) prove a weak solution exists.</li>
<li>Prove that $u$ is sufficiently regular and is a solution to the PDE in the usual sense.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've omitted the question of uniqueness here, as that tends to vary in approach and is often somewhat separate from the existence part.</p>

<p>The calculus of variations is useful for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It provides a way of doing step 1 of the above method.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover the weak solutions we assert exist often satisfy additional properties, which can be useful for step 2.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the following, we will assume we are solving the equation $Mu = 0$ where $M$ is a (often nonlinear) differential operator in some domain in $\mathbb R^n,$ which coincides with the Euler-Lagrange equation of the functional $I[w].$</p>

<p><strong>Existence:</strong> Under appropriate convexity and growth conditions, we can prove the existence of a weak solution by showing a stationary point of $I[w]$ exists. The idea is that if $I[w]$ is continuous on a compact subspace of functions, then it will attain a global maximum / minimum there. Then we can show this max/min satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation in a weak sense.</p>

<p>In practice there are technicalities (we often can't show $I[w]$ is continuous with respect to the topology we impose on $X$), but the general idea is to show the existence of a minimum and to prove it also solves the PDE.</p>

<p><strong>Additional information:</strong> If we have a stationary point $u$ is actually a minimum, then we have $I''[u] \geq 0,$ in the sense that for all nice functions $v,$
$$ \frac{d^2}{dt^2} I[u + tv] \geq 0. $$
By differentiating under the integral sign (which we can justify with appropriate hypotheses) we obtain the second variation. Hence our solution $u$ not only satisfies the PDE $Mu = 0$ in a weak sense, but it also satisfies another differential inequality. This is useful in proving that $u$ is actually more regular (smooth) than we initially assumed, which serves as a starting point for step 2.</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally, I will mention that the equations obtained are often <em>elliptic.</em> One can show that if $I[w]$ is convex and $u$ is a local minimum, then the associated equation has an elliptic structure. This is based on analysing the second variation and is explained in detail in Evan's PDE book (section 8.1.3).</p>

<ol>
<li>First of all, the members of each pair can swap places (or at least it just wants to know what pair goes onto a scooter; it does not distinguish driver from passenger). So, for example, if you have line-up:</li>

The volume of  $T'$ is $\frac16$ of the volume of the parallelepiped $P$ with one vertex at $O$ and spanned by the 3 vectors $A', B', C'$. Since the volume of a parallelepiped can be expressed as a cross product which equals to corresponding determinant, we have:</p>

Whenever you have a finite limit for the numerator and a 0 limit for the denominator, the limit will either be nonexistent (if the signs don't match on opposite sides) or $\pm \infty$ (if they do). In this case the denominator is positive on both sides, so, since the numerator is negative, the limit will be $-\infty$. It is this sense in which $-7/0^+ = -\infty$.

The result immediately follows from this fact, since we will then have $$\inf\sum_i\left(\sup_{\omega\in A_i}f(\omega)\right)\mu(A_i)\geq\left(\sup_{\omega\in A_i}f(\omega)\right)\mu(A_i)=\infty\cdot\mu(A_i)=\infty.$$</p>

On the other hand, if one of them has measure zero, then the result is obvious. Without loss of generality, say $A$ has measure zero. Then for all $x$,
$$\mu\{\omega\in A^c:f(\omega)\geq x\}=\mu\{\omega\in\Omega:f(\omega)\geq x\}&gt;0,$$
so $f$ is unbounded on $A^c$. Note that $\mu(A^c)&gt;0$ since $A^c\supseteq\{\omega\in A^c:f(\omega)\geq1\}$.</p>

<p>Using hypergeometric transformations we can prove the formula $$\left(\frac{2K(k)}{\pi}\right)^{2}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdots (2n-1)}{2\cdot 4\cdot 6\cdots (2n)}\right)^{3}(2kk')^{2n}\tag{1}$$ (see complete proof <a href=""http://paramanands.blogspot.com/2011/10/elementary-approach-to-modular-equations-hypergeometric-series-2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>). Note that the above equation can be thought of as an identity involving the nome $q=e^{-\pi K'/K} $ also and then we can switch from $q$ to $-q$. In terms of Jacobi's theta functions we have $2K/\pi=\vartheta_{3}^{2}(q)$ and replacing $q$ by $-q$ leads us to $$\vartheta_{3}^{2}(-q)=\vartheta_{4}^{2}(q)=\frac{\vartheta_{4}^{2}(q)}{\vartheta_{3}^{2}(q)}\cdot\vartheta_{3}^{2}(q)=k'\cdot\frac{2K}{\pi}$$ Similarly we have $$(2kk')^{2}=4k^{2}k'^{2}=4\cdot\frac{\vartheta_{2}^{4}(q)\vartheta_{4}^{4}(q)}{\vartheta_{3}^{8}(q)}=4\cdot\frac{16q\psi^{4}(q^{2})\vartheta_{4}^{4}(q)}{\vartheta_{3}^{8}(q)}$$ where $\psi$ is one of Ramanujan's theta functions. Now changing $q$ into $-q$ interchanges $\vartheta_{3},\vartheta_{4}$ and hence the above expression becomes $$-4\cdot\frac{16q\psi^{4}(q^{2})\vartheta_{3}^{4}(q)}{\vartheta_{4}^{8}(q)} =-4\cdot\frac{\vartheta_{2}^{4}(q)/\vartheta_{3}^{4}(q)} {\vartheta_{4}^{8}(q)/\vartheta_{3}^{8}(q)}=-\frac{4k^{2}}{k'^{4}} $$ So we have the formula $$k'^{2}\left(\frac{2K}{\pi}\right)^{2}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}\left(\frac{1\cdot 3\cdots (2n-1)}{2\cdot 4\cdots(2n)}\right)^{3}(2k/k'^{2})^{2n}\tag{2}$$ And putting $k=\sqrt{2}-1$ we get the desired sum.</p>

<p>As indicated in a comment from Jack d'Aurizio the sum in question can also be expressed in terms of arithmetic-geometric-mean as $$\frac{2}{\operatorname {AGM} (\sqrt{2},\sqrt{1+\sqrt{2}})^{2}}\tag{3}$$ Writing in this manner helps to evaluate the sum very accurately with a few iterations of the AGM.</p>

$$
\lim_{n\to \infty}\int_{\mathbb{R}} \psi_n(x)f(x)\, dx  = f'(0)

"2393883","2393918","<p>Suppose a service maintains $240,000$ subscribers with an annual churn rate of $80\%.$

<p>That averages to $16,000$ cancellations per month, which works out to a monthly churn rate of $(16,000/240,000)\times100\%\approx6.67\%.$</p>

<p>Not $12.55\%.$</p>

<p>A nice feature of this kind of churn calculation is that the average duration of a subscription is the reciprocal of the churn rate. </p>

<p>If you want to calculate churn by cohorts instead, then you need a model of how the cohort decays. For example, if you start with a cohort of $240,000$ and have $16,000$ cancellations from that cohort every month, you'll have an $80\%$ churn rate in the first year, and nobody from that cohort will remain after $15$ months. The monthly churn rate starts at just $6.67\%$ but rapidly increases (in the $15$th month it's $100\%.$)</p>

<p>The reciprocal relationship doesn't work out so neatly, however. If the cohort of $240,000$ were all new subscribers, their average duration is only $7.5$ months. </p>

<p>Another model is exponential decay. In this model the monthly attrition rate is constant, and the annual attrition rate is related to the monthly rate by a compounding formula as shown in the question. But the average duration of a subscription in that model depends on the <em>instantaneous</em> rate of attrition, which is related to both the monthly and annual rates by a formula of continuous compounding, and it predicts a shorter average duration than either the reciprocal of the monthly attrition or of the annual attrition. </p>

<p>For an exponential model with a small churn rate, however, the reciprocal formula for a short enough time period predicts about the same average subscription duration as the instantaneous rate does. For example, suppose the model is that the size of the cohort is $ne^{-0.03t}$ where $t$ is the number of months elapsed. This mathematical model has an average subscription duration of exactly $1/0.03=33\frac13$ months. 
After one month, this model predicts that you will lose $2.9554\%$ of your customers. 
The reciprocal formula then gives you $33.836$ months--not the same exact duration, but the difference may be a lot less than the inaccuracy of the model. </p>

<p>If we project the same exponential model to one year, it predicts you lose $30.23\%$ of customers. The reciprocal formula then gives you $3.308$ years, which is $39.69$ months. That's $6$ months longer than the mathematically precise answer for this model--but if the kind of answer you want is ""about three years"" then it's still good enough. Or you can choose your time unit so that the churn is a much smaller percentage and thereby avoid this source of disagreement with the model. </p>

"2393902","2394052","<p>The volume of a parallelepiped is indeed $V=xyz$. If it is inscribed into an ellipse $x^2/a^2+y^2/b^2+z^2/c^2=1$, then $z$ in the volume formula can be replaced by $z$ from the ellipse. Now the picture only shows $1/8$th part (there are $8$ octants) of the whole parallelepiped. Hence: $V_{large}=8V_{small}$. So there are two ways to find the volume of the large parallelepiped: direct or indirect:
$$Direct: \ \ V_{large}=2x\cdot 2y\cdot 2\cdot c\sqrt{1-\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}}.$$
$$Indirect: \ \ V_{large}=8V_{small}=8\cdot x\cdot y\cdot c\sqrt{1-\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}}.$$

<p>The ordinals generalize the natural numbers in a certain sense, but that <em>does not mean</em> that every property of the natural numbers carries over to the ordinals. Weird though it may be, neither ordinal addition nor ordinal multiplication are commutative.</p>

<p>Ordinals are weird beasts. It's best at first to think of an ordinal as a particular linear order - a collection of dots laid out in a line <em>(not every linear order corresponds to an ordinal, of course, but every ordinal corresponds to a linear order)</em>. ""$\alpha+\beta$"" is what you get by putting a copy of $\beta$ after a copy of $\alpha$; ""$\alpha\cdot \beta$"" is what you get when you replace each point in $\beta$ with a copy of $\alpha$.</p>

 and this latter does <strong>not</strong> look like $\omega$ (unlike $\omega$, it has a last element).</p>

<p>Here's another picture-argument: first, thinking about $2\omega$, we have $$2\omega\quad=\quad (2)+(2)+(2)+...\quad=\quad ({\large\bullet}+{\large\bullet})+({\large\bullet}+{\large\bullet})+...\quad=\quad {\large\bullet}+{\large\bullet}+{\large\bullet}+{\large\bullet}+...\quad=\quad\omega,$$ but $\omega2$ is $$\omega2\quad=\quad(\omega)+(\omega)={\large\bullet}+{\large\bullet}+{\large\bullet}+...{\color{\red}+ \color{red}{\large\bullet}}+{\large\bullet}+{\large\bullet}+...,$$
 and this does <strong>not</strong> look like $\omega$ (unlike $\omega$, it has an element with no immediate predecessor).</p>

<hr>

<p>In your title problem, since commutativity fails we can't argue that $$\omega+1+\omega+1=\omega+\omega+1+1=\omega+\omega+2;$$ the right answer is instead to see that $$\omega+1+\omega+1=\omega+(1+\omega)+1=\omega+\omega+1.$$ Similarly, we have to keep straight the difference between $\omega+\omega,$ which is $\omega2$, and $2\omega$.

"2394045","2394078","<p>After doing a quick Google search I came across this blog post: <a href=""https://cuhkmath.wordpress.com/2015/08/14/mean-value-theorems-for-harmonic-functions-on-riemannian-manifolds/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://cuhkmath.wordpress.com/2015/08/14/mean-value-theorems-for-harmonic-functions-on-riemannian-manifolds/</a></p>

<p>The main points of the article are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The mean value property of harmonic functions holds on an arbitrary manifold $M$ only when for every point $p\in M$ every geodesic sphere near $p$ has constant mean curvature. Such manifolds are called <em>harmonic manifolds</em>. This coincides with the intuition I had in my comments above.</p></li>
<li><p>For any smooth function $u$ on an $n$-manifold $(M,g)$ it holds that $$\frac{1}{\mathrm{vol}(\partial B_r(p)}\int_{\partial B_r(p)}u(y)~d\sigma(y)=u(p)+\frac{\Delta u(p)}{2n}r^2 + \mathscr{O}(r^4).$$
The $\mathscr{O}(r^4)$ term is given by $B(n)r^4 + \mathscr{O}(r^6)$, where $$B(n):=\frac{1}{24(n+2)}\left(3\Delta^2u - 2\langle\nabla^2 u,\rho\rangle-3\langle\nabla u,\nabla\tau\rangle + \frac{4}{n}\tau\Delta u\right).$$
In the above $\rho(x,y)=\mathrm{tr}\left(R(\cdot,x,y,\cdot)\right)$, $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor, and $\tau=\mathrm{tr}(\rho)$.</p></li>
<li><p>We have a similar mean value property for geodesic balls. For any smooth function $u$ it holds that $$\frac{1}{\mathrm{vol}(B_r(p))}\int_{B_r(p)}u(y)~d\mu(y)=u(p) + \frac{\Delta u(p)}{2(n+2)}r^2 + B(n+2)r^4 + \mathscr{O}(r^6).$$</p></li>
<li><p>You have similar sub-mean value properties for subharmonic functions given bounds on the Ricci and Riemann curvatures.</p></li>
</ul>

"2394060","2394067","<p>According to <a href=""http://jeff560.tripod.com/operation.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols</a>:</p>

"
"2394075","2394081","<p>Here is an approach using power series expansions.</p>

<p>It is known that for $t\in (-1,1)$
$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-t}} =(1-t)^{-1/2}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty 
\binom{-1/2}{n}  (-t)^{n}=
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1 }{2^{2n}}\binom{2n}{n}  t^{n},$$
and for $t\in [-1,1]$,
$$\arcsin(t) =\int_0^t\frac{ds}{\sqrt{1-s^2}}= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1 }{2^{2n}}\binom{2n}{n} \frac{ t^{2n+1}}{2n+1}.$$
Hence, the given integral is equal to
\begin{align*}I&amp;=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1 }{2^{2n}}\binom{2n}{n} \frac{1}{2n+1}\int_0^{\pi/2}\int_0^{\pi/2} \sin x (\sin x \sin y)^{2n+1} \ dx \ dy\\
&amp;=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1 }{2^{2n}}\binom{2n}{n} \frac{1}{2n+1}W_{2n+2} W_{2n+1} \\
&amp;=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1 }{2^{2n}}\binom{2n}{n} \frac{1}{2n+1}\cdot \frac{\pi}{4(n+1)}\\
&amp;=\frac{\pi}{4}\left(2\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1 }{2^{2n}}\binom{2n}{n} \frac{1}{2n+1}-\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1 }{2^{2n}}\binom{2n}{n} \frac{1}{n+1}\right)\\
&amp;=\frac{\pi}{4}\left(2\arcsin(1)-\int_0^1\frac{dt}{\sqrt{1-t}}\right)\\
&amp;=\frac{\pi(\pi-2)}{4}.
\end{align*}
where $W_r=\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\sin^r(t)dt $ denotes the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis%27_integrals"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wallis integral</a> of order $r$.</p>
"
"2394082","2394147","<p>You can eliminate one of the dependent variables and obtain a single equation of the fourth order:</p>

<p>$$\theta=-0.1\arcsin \ddot s$$</p>

<p>$$\dot\theta=-0.1\dddot s(1-\ddot s^2)^{-1/2}$$</p>

<p>$$\ddot\theta=-0.1\ddddot s(1-\ddot s^2)^{-1/2}+0.1\ddot s\dddot s^2(1-\ddot s^2)^{-3/2}=15(1-0.01\ddot s^2)^{1/2}\frac{2s+1}{1+3s^2}.$$</p>

"
"2394083","2394128","<p>You assumed the boxes were distinguishable, leading to $\frac{200!}{(10!)^{20}}$, ways to fill the boxes. If you make them indistinguishable, you merge the $20!$ ways of reordering the boxes into one, so that previous answer overcounts each way of filling indistinguishable boxes by a factor of $20!$. Therefore you are left with $\frac{200!}{(10!)^{20}}/20!$ ways to fill 20 indistinguishable boxes, which then must be an integer. After multiplying by $20$ it is of course still an integer.</p>
"
"2394088","2394089","<p>Yes, because by the triangle inequlity
$$ ||a|-|b||\leq |a-b|$$
and of course $|a|-|b|\leq ||a|-|b||$.</p>
"
"2394098","2394110","<p>Yes, this follows quite directly form the least upper bound property for $\mathbb R$.</p>

<p>However you're not guaranteed to have a sequence converging to the $\inf$ or $\sup$. You can for example take the set of $(t, -t)$ where $|t|\le 1$. The majorants of this set is $(x,y)$ such that $x\ge 1$ and $y\ge 1$. The least of these is $(1,1)$, but you can't make $(t_n, -t_n)\to (1,1)$ regardless of what sequence $t_n$ you choose.</p>

<p>Normally in general metric spaces one don't use the least upper bound property as much as one does in real analysis. The reason is partly the above failure, but also that it requires that the set is ordered which is normally not needed for what lub property is used for. Instead one uses the concept of completeness, the property that each Cauchy sequence is convergent.</p>
"
"2394106","2394161","<p>Maybe the Fourier transform?  Let $h_t(x)=\frac{f(x+t)-f(x)}{t}$, with $\widehat h_t(\xi)=\frac{e^{it\xi}-1}{t}\widehat f(\xi)$.  The condition $\|h_t\|_1\to 0$ implies $\|\widehat h_t\|_\infty\to 0$, which seems to imply $\widehat f(\xi)=0$, since $\widehat h_t(\xi)\to i\xi \widehat f(\xi)$.  By continuity, it would seem $\widehat f(0)=0$ as well.</p>
"
"2394107","2394942","<p>The count for successes when selecting without replacement would be a <strong>hypergeometric</strong> random variable rather than <strong>binomial</strong>, though for selection of a small enough sample from a large population this <em>approximates</em> selection with replacement (<em>if</em> removing small amount of successes does not significantly impact the proportion in the population). </p>

<p><em>However</em>, this is of no import for the expectation due to the <strong>Linearity of Expectation</strong></p>

<p>It seems counterintuitive the first time students encounter this, but expectation of a series of trials equals the series of expectations of each trial,  <em>without any influence at all</em> by whether the trials are independent or not.</p>

<p>If $X$ equals the count of successes in $n$ selections of jurors, and $X_k$ indicates a success on trial $k$-th selection, so $X=\sum_{k=1}^n X_k$, then the expectation for $X$ will be : $\mathsf E(X) ~{ =  \mathsf E(\sum_{k=1}^n X_k) \\ = \sum_{k=1}^n \mathsf E(X_k) \\ = n p}$ </p>

<p>Reguardless of how you model the selection.</p>

<hr>

<p>To get a idea of what is going on, consider the count in a sample of size two; whether selecting with or  without replacement, the expectation is:</p>

<p>$$\mathsf E(X) ~{= \mathsf E(X_1+X_2) \\ = \sum_{(x_1,x_2)\in \{0,1\}^2} (x_1+x_2)\mathsf P(X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2) \\ = \sum_{x_1=0}^1\sum_{x_2=0}^1 x_1\mathsf P(X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2) + \sum_{x_1=0}^1\sum_{x_2=0}^1 x_2\mathsf P(X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2) \\ \\ = \sum_{x_1=0}^1 x_1\sum_{x_2=0}^1 \mathsf P(X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2) + \sum_{x_2=0}^1 x_2\sum_{x_1=0}^1 \mathsf P(X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2) \\ = \sum_{x_1=0}^1 x_1\mathsf P(X_1=x_1)+ \sum_{x_2=0}^1 x_2\mathsf P(X_2=x_2) \\ = \mathsf E(X_1)+\mathsf E(X_2) \\ = 2p }$$</p>

"2394216","2394309","<p>you answered in a comment: ""I thought there is something more specific in scalar meaning then just minimal dimension count.""</p>

<ol>
<li><p>""Scalars"" are usually understood as elements of a field (in the sense of rationality field where rational operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (not by zero) can be performed (commutatively). So not in the sense of vector field).</p></li>
<li><p>""Dimension"" as algebraic concept is a property of a vector space over some field. You cannot talk about a dimension without specifing the field over which the space is defined.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You say that a scalar is monodimensional. This should be restated: a real number can be thought of as a vector of a vector space over the reals and this vector space is monodimensional.
But this is a fact of algebra: every field can be though of as a monodimensional vector space over itself.
This pragmatically speaking means that every linear operaton on a monodimensional vector space are of the type ""multiplication of a vector by a scalar"": for whatever linear operator on the vector space there is a unique scalar that multiplicatively coincides with it.</p>

<p>As an example: in $\mathbb{R}^2$ thought simply as an abelian group where its elements can be commutatively added, it is possible to introduce a structure of vector space over the reals and in such a case it becomes a bidimensional vector space. Here you can find $\mathbb{R}$-linear operators that cannot be given by scalars (think of a general matrix), but only some of them are isomorphic to the field (that is, can be identified with the scalars, think of matrix like $aI$, where $a\in\mathbb{R}$ and $I$ is the identity matrix: $aIx=ax; (aI+bI)x=(a+b)x: aIbIx=abx$, where $x\in\mathbb{R}^2$). Here remember that by $\mathbb{R}$-linear operator is meant an operator that preserve the addition of vectors and the multiplication of a vector by a scalar: $A(x+y)=Ax+Ay$ and $Acx=cAx$</p>

<p>At the same time in the abelian additive group $\mathbb{R}^2$ can also be introduced the structure of vector space over a (rationality) field of operator on $\mathbb{R}^2$ that preserve the addition of vectors and the rotation of vectors: $B(x+y)=Bx+By$ and $B\Theta x=\Theta Bx$, where $\Theta=\begin{bmatrix}\cos \theta&amp;-\sin\theta\\\sin\theta&amp;\phantom-\cos \theta\end{bmatrix}$</p>

<p>You can easily prove that such operators are of the type $B=\begin{bmatrix}b_1&amp;-b_2\\b_2&amp;\phantom-b_1\end{bmatrix}=|B|\begin{bmatrix}\cos\beta&amp;-\sin\beta\\\sin\beta&amp;\phantom-\cos\beta\end{bmatrix}$ where $|B|=\sqrt{b_1^2+b_2^2}$ and $\beta=\arctan \frac{b_2}{b_1}$</p>

<p>In addition these operators form a rationality field: all rational operations can be performed (commutatively) giving always (with the exception of division by zero) and uniquely an operator in that same field. By multiplication it is meant the composition.</p>

<p>You now also see that such operators can be identified with the elements of $\mathbb{R}^2$: identifying the operator $B$ with the vector $b=(b_1, b_2)$, you can write $Bx=bx; (B+C)x=(b+c)x; BCx=bcx$. These formulae introduce the structure of field on $\mathbb{R}^2$: that is elements of $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be called scalars and they can be used in rational operations. In particular multiplying to elements of $\mathbb{R}^2$ means interpreting them as scalars, that is as operators that preserve additions and rotations, composing them, and reinterpreting the result as vector (analogously for the division).</p>

<p>You also notice that the multiplication by a scalar is preserved by such operators, because $B(Cx)=C(Bx)$. So they are linear operator on $\mathbb{R}^2$ over the new field.
So this new structure of vector space we are introducing in $\mathbb{R}^2$ over itself is monodimensional, even though scalars are identifiable with vectors (as happend with the real line) but these have two real components. </p>

<p>Usually this particular field (whose elements have 2 real components) representing only those $\mathbb{R}$-linear operators that preserve the rotations is called complex field and its elements complex numbers, and the special $\mathbb{R}$-linear operators they represent are called $\mathbb{C}$-linear operators.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> (answering your question in the comment section)</p>

<p>Scalars let define which, among the operators that preserve additions of the elements of the abelian group (what is going to be a vector space), are linear (that is, also preserve multiplication by scalars). So linearity depends on scalars. After that, scalars can be (field-homomorphically) identified with some linear operators: these are all those linear operators that commute with all the linear operators. On the other hand, an ""ordered set of components of a vector"" (meaning a numerical representation of the vector, or ""numerical vector"") gives under (in general non-linear) operator the vector itself: this operator is called ""coordinate system"" and is usually defined on a subset of the cartesian power of a field (usually the same field over which the vector space is defined, but it is not a need) into the vector space. A component of a vector happens to be a ""scalar"" only for a fortuitous case. More exactly, it is an element of the field on which the space is defined but NOT a scalar, that is, it does not represent a linear operator even though it is in the field, that is, it does  change while the scalar does not change under coordinate-system changes (I can give a proof here). So it should not be called scalar to avoid confusion even though it in the the same field over which the space is defined.</p>

<p>(do not say that a scalar has a dimension. Vector spaces have dimension that depends on the scalars. The set of scalars (a field) is always a monodimensional vector space over itself and a monodimensional subspace of whatever vector space over such a field. This is true even if scalar are ""complex"" entities not simple reals, made up of more than one ""component"". The fact that a vector, or in general an element of a set, has $n$ component does not mean that it is an element of a vector space of dimension $n$: in this reasoning no mention has been made of the field of scalar, so $n$ cannot be said a dimension. Moreover coordinate systems need not be injective: you can have more numerical vectors representing one and the same vector. You can have ""redundant"" components. Or you can have components that are not from the same set of the scalars of the vector space. In the example made of the vector space $\mathbb{R}^2$ over the complex scalars, a vector of it has $2$ real components where it is chosen a real cartesian coordinate system, or it has only one complex component if a complex cartesian coordinate system is chosen, or it can have more than $2$ real components in a real non injective (that is, ""redundant"") coordinate system, etc. etc.)</p>

<p>Then,
$$\frac{5}{2} \iint_{-D} x + xy f(x^2+y^2) \,dA
=\frac{5}{2} \iint_{D} -x + xy f(x^2+y^2) \,dA.

Let this value be denoted by $I_{-D}$. Similarly let $I_D=\frac{5}{2} \iint_{D} x + xy f(x^2+y^2) \,dA$ and let $I_R=\frac{5}{2} \iint_{R} x + xy f(x^2+y^2) \,dA$.

<p>On the other hand, $I_D+I_{-D}=I_R$. 
As long as we can work out $I_R$, we can solve for $I_D$.</p>

<p>Now, because the region, $R$, is symmetric about the $x$-axis, replacing $y$ by $-y$ and integrating over the region will yield the same result. However when we substitute in $-y$, we get 
$$\frac{5}{2} \iint_D x -xy f(x^2+y^2) \,dA.$$
Then we have 
$$2I_R = \frac{5}{2} \iint_R x -xy f(x^2+y^2) \,dA + \frac{5}{2} \iint_R x +xy f(x^2+y^2) \,dA = 5 \iint_R x \,dA, $$

$$I_R = \frac{5}{2} \iint_R x \,dA = 0, $$
since $R$ is symmetric around the $y$-axis, so positive $x$ values cancel
with negative $x$ values.</p>

<p>Therefore $I_D+I_{-D}=0$, so $-I_D=I_{-D}$.</p>

<ul>
<li>Start from the right, the end of the vector, in this case a $1$. </li>

<li>Now you have to swap the $2$ with the next-higher element that lies somewhere to its right. This is simple to find, because we know all those elements in this tail are in decreasing order.

</ul>

<p>$$(3,4,1,2,5,6)$$</p>

<p>That's it. If you keep applying this procedure, you will generate the permutations in lexicographical order. If you repeat the procedure again, you get:</p>

<p>You can easily extend this to deal with multiple labels. Apply the procedure to the last set of elements with the same label. If that worked normally, you are done.

"2394445","2394478","<p>I think you're misunderstanding the problem.  The problem is not to show that functions $\{\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t), P(\mathbf{x},t)\}$ exist which satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations;  that much is relatively easy.  The problem is to show that given <strong>any</strong> function $\mathbf{u}^\circ(\mathbf{x})$, there exists functions $\{\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t), P(\mathbf{x},t)\}$ that satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations and satisfy
$$
\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},0) = \mathbf{u}^\circ(\mathbf{x}).
$$
This function $\mathbf{u}^\circ(\mathbf{x})$ is called the <em>initial data</em>;  it basically tells you what the system is doing at the moment you start your stopwatch.</p>

<p>For your function, you have $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},0) = (1,1,1)$.  I haven't gone carefully through your math, but even if this were a solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, it would only be a drop in the bucket.  You'd then have to find a solution with $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},0) = (e^{-(x^2+y^2 + z^2)}, 0, 0)$.  And then $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},0) = e^{-(x^2+y^2 + z^2)}(\sin(z^2+x), x^2, \tanh(y))$.  And then <em>every other conceivable function</em> that I could give you for the initial data.  </p>

<p>Obviously, it's impossible to write down a solution for every conceivable function, for the simple reason that there are infinitely many such functions and you don't have an infinite amount of time.  Rather, when mathematicians are trying to prove existence of solutions to PDEs, they try to find a general solution in the form of integrals involving the initial data, and then prove that these integrals are well-behaved no matter what the initial data is.  Sometimes, they have to impose certain conditions on the initial data to make sure that their integrals are well-behaved;  these are the conditions that you ran into in your last post.</p>
"
"2394452","2394509","<p>A <em>vector field</em> is just a function $\mathbf{F}:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$. (Or the domain can be some subset $D$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, not all of it, of course. To avoid making this remark repetitively, I'll just stick with $\mathbb{R}^n$, as an example). From an intuitive/geometrical point of view, it is best visualized as having a vector attached to (or starting from) each point of the domain $D$. Given a multivariable function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$, its gradient $\nabla f$ is precisely that kind of a function, as it acts from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$, so it is a vector field.</p>

<p>What the book says is that not all vector fields can be obtained in this way. Intuitively, it should make sense: the fact that the components of $\nabla f$ are derived from the same original function $f$ should result in some relationships among them. If you put random functions as components, most likely they wouldn't be related in that special way. It's like siblings: being the descendants of the same parents they have some things in common, something that random people wouldn't.</p>

<p>In more mathematical terms, one of such special relationships is the condition of equality of mixed partial derivatives. Say, for a function of two variables $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$, we must have $\displaystyle \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial y\partial x}=\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x\partial y}$, assuming these derivatives are continuous. Therefore, if $\displaystyle \mathbf{F}=\nabla f=\left\langle\frac{\partial f}{\partial x},\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right\rangle=\langle M,N\rangle$ is its gradient, then we have to have
$$\color{blue}{\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}}=\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial y\partial x}=\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x\partial y}=\color{blue}{\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}}.$$</p>

<p>So being the gradient is very special! This condition allows you to construct vector fields that are not gradients. Pretty much anything you would put into a vector field at random almost surely wouldn't be a gradient. For example, $\mathbf{F}(x,y)=\langle 2x+3y,4x+5y\rangle$ isn't a gradient, because
$$\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}=3\neq4=\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}.$$</p>
"
"2394456","2394909","<p>I'll start with some critique. First of all, your normal vector isn't quite correct: from the equation of the plane $-2x+z=0$, we get the normal vector $\mathbf{n}=\langle-2,0,1\rangle$ (or it could be its opposite, but this one gives the upward orientation, consistent with the counterclockwise orientation of the curve $C$). Fortunately, it doesn't affect your solution because the first component of curl is zero.</p>

<p>Second, it is a really bad habit to drop differentials, representing the variables of integration, from integral notation! For example, the last line of your computation should be written as
$$\iint_S (2x-xz)\,dx\,dy=\iint_S (2x-2x^2)\,dx\,dy=\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}\int_0^{2\cos\theta} (2r\cos\theta-2r^2\cos^2\theta)r\,dr\,d\theta.$$</p>

<p>Third, you must be much more clear regarding domains of integration. The ""equality""
$$\iint_S \operatorname{curl}F\cdot\mathbf{n}\,dS=\iint_S (2x-2x^2)\,dx\,dy$$
is wrong because the domains of integration in these two integrals are <strong>NOT</strong> the same and thus cannot be denoted by the same letter $\color{red}{S}$. If $S$ stands for the portion of the plane cut out by the paraboloid (or cylinder), then it's rightfully used in the first integral, but not in the second. The second one represents a double integral over a region $D$ in the $xy$-plane after you effectively parameterized the surface $S$. And this region $D$ is the disk $(x-1)^2+y^2=1$, that you correctly found. And to integrate over this $D$, it certainly makes sense to switch to polar coordinates.</p>

<p>In the end of the day, you did get a correct double integral in polar coordinates (also see above), so you can finish solving this problem by evaluating that integral. (I presume you can do that, and you don't need us to give you the answer.)</p>

<p>Now, a very short <strong>main answer</strong> to your <strong>main question</strong>: <strong><em>YES</em></strong>, we are allowed to choose any such surface. :-)</p>

"2394500","2394628","<p>Let $E$ denote the interior of the ellipse and $\partial E$ the boundary (i.e. the ellipse itself). You're trying to calculate</p>

<p>$$\color{blue}{\oint_{\partial E}\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{r}}$$</p>

<p>Your first hope is that Green's theorem applies, so you can instead calculate</p>

<p>$$\int_E(Q_x-P_y)\,dA$$</p>

<p>The problem is that <em>the hypotheses of Green's theorem are not satisfied</em>, for the functions $P$ and $Q$ are not continuously differentiable throughout the region $E$. As you observed, there is no way we may continuously extend the field to be defined at the point $(1,0)$, so that point is a singularity.</p>

<p>The way to proceed in such cases is to put a little closed curve around the singularity but still lying entirely inside the region $E$ of interest; in this case a unit circle will be convenient (the calculation will show you why). So let $D$ be the unit disk centered at $(1,0)$, and let $\partial D$ be the unit <em>circle</em> centered there, which has parametrization $C(t)=(\cos t +1, \sin t)$ for $t\in[0,2\pi)$. </p>

<p>You can easily check by direct calculation that </p>

<p>$$\color{red}{\oint_{\partial D}\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{r}}=\int_0^{2\pi}(\cos^2t+\sin^2t)\,dt=2\pi$$</p>

<p>Now, consider the region $E-D$, the complement of the disk in the elliptical region. In <em>this</em> region, $P$ and $Q$ <em>are</em> continuously differentiable everywhere, so we <em>may</em> use Green's theorem, which says</p>

<p>$$\int_{E-D}(Q_x-P_y)\,dA=\oint_{\partial(E-D)}\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{r}\tag{$\star$}$$</p>

<p>The left side vanishes, because $Q_x-P_y=0$ in the region $E-D$. What about the right side? What is the ""boundary"" $\partial(E-D)$ of the elliptical annular region $E-D$? It is $\partial E - \partial D$, where we interpret the negative sign on $\partial D$ to mean reversing the standard counterclockwise orientation.</p>

<p>So $(\star)$ says</p>

<p>$$0=\color{blue}{\oint_{\partial E}\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{r}}-\color{red}{\oint_{\partial D}\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{R}}$$</p>

<p>The blue integral is the one the problem asks for, and the red integral we calculated above.</p>

<hr>

<p>To summarize, the strategy for calculating line integrals of <em>curl-free</em> fields around closed curves that encircle a single singularity is to replace the original closed curve with an easier one (but still contained within the original one). Green's theorem in the region <em>between</em> the curves guarantees the line integral around the easier curve equals the line integral around the original curve. </p>

<p>What makes a good candidate for an ""easier curve""? Well, you're trying to find a curve whose parametrization will make the integrand simple enough to calculate. In your problem, integrating around the <em>ellipse</em> gives a ""hard"" integrand. But integrating around a <em>circle centered at the singularity</em> gives an ""easy"" integrand. </p>

<p>Why a circle in this case? Because your field is closely related to the pullback of the length element of a circle of radius $r$ (the length element is $ds=r d\theta$); thus it was, in some sense, <em>tailor-made</em> to be integrated around a circle. It is not always so easy to spot what sort of curve will make the line integral easier, but you should remember the general form $(-\frac{y}{r^2}, \frac{x}{r^2})$, which is $\frac{1}{r}$ times the circle's unit tangent vector. The line integral of the unit tangent vector around the circle gives $2\pi r$, and the factor $\frac{1}{r}$ scales the result to $2\pi$. (In other words, you are just integrating $d\theta=\frac{1}{r}ds$ around the circle.) So the <em>radius</em> of the circle you use around the singularity doesn't matter. (This make sense, because the region between two concentric circles centered at the singularity doesn't contain a singularity and the field is conservative there, so by the above argument, the line integral of the field around them should be the same.)</p>

<p>Well, that is a completely different topic from composition of rotations! </p>

<p>If $C$ is the rotor that converts from the old basis $\{e_1,\ldots, e_n\}$ onto the new basis $\{f_1,\ldots f_n\}$, then</p>

<p>$CRe_iR^\dagger C^\dagger = CRC^\dagger f_iCR^\dagger C^\dagger$, and so $CRC^\dagger$ expresses the rotation in the new basis of $f_i$'s.</p>

<p>Personally I don't like the idea of using the phrase ""rotating a rotor."" Conceptually there is supposed to be a divide here between ""space"" and ""operators."" That is, the space is the set that models what is being transformed, and the operators are what do the transforming. </p>

<p>""Rotating a rotor"" makes me think the two things are being muddled together. (Although, it might be a good mnemonic for remembering how an orthogonal change of basis can be used.) Maybe something like this is what led to your question.</p>

"2394565","2394596","<p>I think there are some points you aren't completely understanding here.
First of all, there is no number line involved here, $X$ is an arbitrary set, with some distance function defined on it, specifically, $X$ is not necessarily linearly ordered, so something like ""the smallest $q$"" doesn't really make sense in this context. </p>

<p>Secondly, if we do assume $X$ is a subset of $\mathbb R$, or linearly ordered, then $N_r(p)$ contains all the points <em>whose distance from p</em> is less than the distance of the nearest $q\in X$ to $p$ (which is probably what you meant).</p>

<p>What we are trying to prove is that $N_r(p)$ contains <em>no</em> points besides $p$, meaning that there aren't any points closer to $p$ than $q$. So if </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the interval within the radius $r$ contains $p$ and some other points smaller than $q$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>those points would be inside $N_r(p)$, and then $N_r(p)$ <em>wouldn't</em> be a neighborhood of $p$ contained in $E$.
Basically, we don't ignore other points in $X$ because we only care about $q$, we ignore them because we specifically chose $q$ such that there <em>aren't</em> any other points between them.</p>

"2394572","2394599","<p>First let us count the number of each letter there are:</p>

<p>$A$-2, $C$-1, $E$-1, $H$-1, $M$-1, $S$-4, $T$-2, $U$-1</p>

<p>For the first and last character to both be vowels, one of three situations will occur:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Neither $A$ is used as a first or last character</p></li>
<li><p>Exactly one $A$ is used as a first or last character</p></li>
<li><p>Both $A$'s are used as first and last characters</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Let us count each case individually.</p>

<p>In the scenario that neither $A$ is used as a first or last character, that implies that the characters are an $E$ and a $U$.  Pick which of the two was the first character and the remaining will be the last character.  We then choose the locations of the two $A$'s simultaneously and then the four $S$'s and the two $T$'s, or equivalently worded we use multinomial coefficients to find the arrangements of the word <code>aachmsssstt</code>.  This gives us: $2\cdot \frac{11!}{2!4!2!}$</p>

<p>In the scenario that exactly one $A$ is used as a first or last character, first select whether the $A$ is the first character or the last character.  Then, pick which of the remaining vowels takes the other spot.  Then, for whichever vowel is left, we arrange <code>achmssssttx</code> where <code>x</code> is the remaining vowel.  This gives us $2\cdot 2\cdot \frac{11!}{4!2!}$</p>

<p>In the scenario that both $A$'s are used as first and last characters, arrange <code>cehmssssttu</code> for the middle.  This gives us $\frac{11!}{4!2!}$</p>

<hr>

<p>An alternate approach:</p>

<p>First select the positions for the four vowels collectively.  Two of them must be the front and back, so that amounts to selecting two more of the center eleven spaces to be used by vowels.  This gives $\binom{11}{2}=\frac{11!}{2!9!}$ options.  Then, select the arrangement of the vowels within those four spaces.  This can be accomplished in $\frac{4!}{2!1!1!}=4\cdot 3$ ways.</p>

<p>We can then separately arrange all of the consonants in $\frac{9!}{4!2!}$ ways and then thread the two strings together.</p>

<p>This gives us a total of $\frac{11!}{2!9!}4\cdot 3\cdot \frac{9!}{4!2!}=\frac{4\cdot 3\cdot 11!}{4!2!2!}$ ways.</p>

"2394582","2394586","<p>Try to use $$(\sqrt{x^2+1}-x)(\sqrt{x^2+1}+x)=1$$</p>
"
"2394585","2394652","<p>We can use generating functions.</p>

<p>Take your example of writing n as a sum of $1$s and $2$s, represent the number of possible $1$s as</p>

<p>$$x^{0\cdot 1}+x^{1\cdot 1}+x^{2\cdot 1}+x^{3\cdot 1}+\cdots$$</p>

<p>What is $x$? You might ask, well it isn't anything, it has no value beyond the formality of allowing us to write out a list of possible $1$s in our sum. E.g. $x^{3\cdot 1}$ denotes the possibility of a sum having three $1$s.</p>

<p>We can do the same with the number of possible $2$s by listing</p>

<p>$$x^{0\cdot 2}+x^{1\cdot 2}+x^{2\cdot 2}+x^{3\cdot 2}+\cdots$$</p>

<p>Now since we are interested in all combinations of $1$ and $2$ added, if we multiply these two lists as if they were series then each resulting term will represent a possible sum, this is called a <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_function"" rel=""noreferrer"">generating function</a></p>

<p>$$(x^{0\cdot 1}+x^{1\cdot 1}+x^{2\cdot 1}+x^{3\cdot 1}+\cdots)(x^{0\cdot 2}+x^{1\cdot 2}+x^{2\cdot 2}+x^{3\cdot 2}+\cdots)\tag{1}$$</p>

<p>So the expansion will have terms like your first example $x^{2\cdot 1+4\cdot 2}=x^{10}$ and the coefficient in front of this term will be the number of times the sum of $10$ can be achieved using $1$s and $2$s.</p>

<p>We are able to use the expansion $(1-u)^{-1}=1+u+u^2+u^3+\cdots$ and the difference between two squares $a^2-b^2=(a-b)(a+b)$ to help us express the product $(1)$ as</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{(1-x)(1-x^2)}=\frac{1}{(1-x)^2(1+x)}\tag{2}$$</p>

<p>which can be written using partial fractions</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}\frac{1}{(1-x)^2(1+x)}&amp;=\frac{1}{2(1-x)^2}-\frac{1}{4(1-x)}+\frac{1}{4(1+x)}\\[1ex]
&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n\ge 0}\binom{n+1}{1}x^n - \frac{1}{4}\sum_{n\ge 0}x^n+\frac{1}{4}\sum_{n\ge 0}(-1)^nx^n\\[1ex]
&amp;=\sum_{n\ge 0}\frac{2(n+1)+1+(-1)^n}{4}x^n\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Hence in the simple case of $1$s and $2$s we can derive a formula</p>

<p>$$\text{required count using $1$s and $2$s}=\frac{2(n+1)+1+(-1)^n}{4}$$</p>

<p>So for example for a sum of $n=10$ there are $(2\cdot 11+1+1)/4=24/4=6$ possible sums.</p>

<p>It is possible to derive formulas for larger sets of possible parts (not just parts of size $1$ and $2$) but the maths becomes more long-winded. In general it is better to use the series products like $(1)$ to derive a $2$ dimensional recurrence (a bit like Pascal's Triangle) to calculate relevant coefficients.</p>

<p>An example of the generating function for sums involving $1$s, $2$s and $3$s is</p>

<p>$$\dfrac{1}{(1-x)(1-x^2)(1-x^3)}$$</p>

<p>derived in the same way as for your example.</p>

for all $x\in\mathbb{Q}$.  This means $f(x+1)=1$ for all $x\in\mathbb{Q}$, which leads to $f\equiv 1$.  From now on, we assume that $f(1)\neq 1$.  </p>

<p>By plugging in $x:=1$ and $y:=-1$ into $(\star)$, we  have
$$f(-1)=f(1)\,f(-1)\,.$$
Because $f(1)\neq 1$, we must have $f(-1)=0$.  Putting $y:=-1$ yields
$$f(-x)=-f(x-1)+1\,.\tag{*}$$
Now, plugging in $x:=1$ and $y:=-2$ into $(\star)$, we obtain
$$f(-2)=f(1)\,f(-2)-f(-1)+1=f(1)\,f(-2)+1\,.$$
Using $(*)$, we have $f(-2)=-f(1)+1$, so the equation above translates to
$$-f(1)+1=-\big(f(1)\big)^2+f(1)+1\,.$$
This gives
$$\big(f(1)\big)^2-2\,f(1)=0\,.$$
That is, $f(1)=0$ or $f(1)=2$.</p>

<p>If $f(1)=0$, then $y:=1$ into $(\star)$ leads to
$$f(x)=-f(x+1)+1\,.\tag{$\Box$}$$
This proves that $f(n)=\frac{1+(-1)^n}{2}$ for every integer $n$, and from $(\Box)$, we get
$$f(x+2)=f(x)$$
for all $x\in\mathbb{Q}$.  Now, if we plug in $y:=n$ into $(\star)$, where $n$ is an even integer, then
$$f(xn)=f(x)\,f(n)-f(x+n)+1=f(x)-f(x)+1=1$$
for every $x\in\mathbb{Q}$.  Thus, substituting $x:=\frac{1}{2}$ and $n:=2$ in the previous equation, we obtain $$0=f(1)=f\left(\frac{1}{2}\cdot 2\right)=1\,,$$
which is absurd.  Hence, $f(1)\neq 0$, and so $f(1)=2$ as required.</p>

<p>Now, $(\star)$ with $y:=1$ implies that
$$f(x+1)=f(x)+1$$
for all $x\in\mathbb{Q}$.  Ergo, we can see that $f(n)=n+1$ for every integer $n$.  Consequently, for a rational number $x=\frac{p}{q}$, where $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}$ with $q&gt;0$, we have
$$p+1=f(p)=f\left(\frac{p}{q}\cdot q\right)=f\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)\,f(q)-f\left(\frac{p}{q}+q\right)+1=(q+1)\,f\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)-f\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)-q+1\,.$$
Hence,
$$f(x)=f\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)=\frac{p+q}{q}=\frac{p}{q}+1=x+1\,,$$
as desired.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.:</strong> It is a very interesting question what happens if the domain extends to $\mathbb{R}$.  All I know is that, if a nonconstant function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{Q}$ satisfies $(\star)$, then
$$f(x+r)=f(x)+r$$
and
$$f(rx)=r\,f(x)-r+1$$
for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$ and $r\in\mathbb{Q}$.</p>

"2394683","2394713","<p>1) An essentially bounded function is exactly what you described. The $f$ you gave is not essentially bounded, because for any real number $M$, there exists $\varepsilon&gt;0$ such that $f(x)&gt;M$ for all $x\in (0,\varepsilon)$. This shows that it is not essentially bounded because $(0,\varepsilon)$ has positive measure.</p>

<p>2) You wrote in part (1) that ""the inequality holds on some set $E$ such that $(0,1)\setminus E$ has zero measure"". This means precisely that the inequality holds almost everywhere. Your example doesn't apply because that $f$ is not essentially bounded. Consider the function $g:(0,1)\to\mathbb{R}$ given by
$$
g(x) = \begin{cases}
n &amp; \text{if}\ x=1/n\ \text{for some}\ n\in\mathbb{N},\,n\geq 2 \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$
Then $g(x)=0\leq 1$ for all $x\in(0,1)\setminus\{1/n\mid n\in\mathbb{N},\,n\geq 2\}$ and $\{1/n \mid n\in\mathbb{N},\,n\geq2\}$ is a measure zero set. Thus $g=0$ a.e., which is another way of saying that the equivalence class of $g$ is equal to the equivalence class of the zero function $0$ under the ""equal a.e."" equivalence relation.</p>

<p>3) Yes, by definition $L_\infty(0,1)$ is the space of all essentially bounded functions from $(0,1)$ into $\mathbb{R}$. Some authors consider the quotient of this space by the ""equal a.e."" equivalence relation, but in practice the two are the same.</p>

<p>4) Do you mean $\|f\|_p=0$ but $f\ne0$? Consider the function $g$ given in (2). Then $\|g\|_p=0$, but $g\ne0$. Now we do have $g=0$ a.e., so some would write $g=0$ and it would be understood that the equality here is with respect to the ""equal a.e."" equivalence relation.</p>

"2394767","2395624","<p>The family $\mathfrak{M} = \{ M(S,V) : S \in \mathfrak{S}, V \in \mathfrak{V}\}$ need not consist of open sets. Some authors define a neighbourhood of a point $x$ as an open set containing $x$, but the other convention - more widespread according to my experience - is that a neighbourhood of $x$ is a set that contains an open set containing $x$, so every superset (open or not) of a neighbourhood is again a neighbourhood.</p>

<p>As your example shows, the sets $M(S,V)$ are in general not open, even if $V$ is open. And defining an open neighbourhood base in the $\mathfrak{S}$-topology is not entirely straightforward, one would have to demand that $V$ is a uniform neighbourhood of $f(S)$ rather than just $f(S) \subset V$.</p>

<p>What we need to get a (translation-invariant) topology from $\mathfrak{M}$ is the compatibility condition between neighbourhood filters. Generally, that condition is</p>

<p>$$\bigl(\forall U \in \mathscr{V}(x)\bigr)\bigl(\exists V \in \mathscr{V}(x)\bigr)\bigl(\forall y \in V\bigr)\bigl(U \in \mathscr{V}(y)\bigr).$$</p>

<p>Here, for a translation-invariant topology induced by $\mathfrak{M}$, that is equivalent to the condition that for all $M(S,V)$ there is an $M(S',V')$ such that for all $f \in M(S',V')$ there is an $M(S'',V'')$ such that $f + M(S'',V'') \subset M(S,V)$. Since $M(S,U) + M(S,W) \subset M(S, U+W)$, we can make a simple choice: If $V'$ is a neighbourhood of $0$ in $F$ with $V' + V' \subset V$, then</p>

<p>$$M(S,V') + M(S,V') \subset M(S, V' + V') \subset M(S,V).\tag{$\ast$}$$</p>

<p>Using $(\ast)$ and $-M(S,V) = M(S, -V)$, we can also see that the $\mathfrak{S}$-topology makes $F^T$ a topological group (Hausdorff iff $F$ is Hausdorff and $\bigcup \mathfrak{S} = T$). However, in general it doesn't make $F^T$ a topological vector space. Although for every scalar $\lambda$ the map $f \mapsto \lambda f$ is continuous, the map $\lambda \mapsto \lambda f$ is not continuous at $0$ if there is an $S\in \mathfrak{S}$ such that $f(S)$ is unbounded. The subspace</p>

<p>$$f_n \colon z \mapsto \frac{1}{n}\bigl(e^{nz}-1\bigr)$$</p>

<p>is, for every $n &gt; 0$, a locally biholomorphic function with $f_n(0) = 0$ and $f_n'(0) = 1$. For large enough $n$, the rectangle $R_n = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : 0 \leqslant \operatorname{Re} z \leqslant 2\log n/n, \lvert \operatorname{Im} z\rvert \leqslant 2\pi/n\}$ is contained in the unit disk. The map $g_n \colon z \mapsto \frac{1}{n} e^{nz}$ maps $R_n$ onto the annulus $A_n = \bigl\{ w\in \mathbb{C} :\frac{1}{n} \leqslant \lvert w\rvert \leqslant 2\bigr\}$, and $A_n - \frac{1}{n}$ contains the unit circle.</p>

<p>Thus the problem asks to prove that the image of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Branges&#39;s_theorem#Schlicht_functions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">schlicht</a> function does not contain the entire unit circle.

<p>Now to prove that the image of a schlicht function cannot contain the whole unit circle, we assume that $f$ were a schlicht function with $f(D) \supset \partial D$. Since $f(D)$ is simply connected, it then follows that $f(D) \supset \overline{D}$. By the maximum modulus principle, $g = f^{-1}\lvert_D$ maps the unit disk into itself. Also, $g(0) = 0$ and $g'(0) = 1$. The Schwarz lemma says that then $g = \operatorname{id}_D$, and consequently $f = \operatorname{id}_D$, but that contradicts $f(D) \supset \partial D$.</p>

"2394840","2394857","<p>Some concerns about your attempt: </p>

<ul>
<li>the $\varepsilon$ is not used in the sequel of the proof.</li>
<li>It is not clear that $w\gt a$ and it has to be justified.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a sketch of solution (the details have to be filled to not spoil the exercise).
Using the assumption $f(a)=0$ and the fundamental theorem of calculus, we have 
$$\tag{*}    f(x)=\int_a^x f'(t)  \mathrm dt  $$
hence by the triangle inequality and $ \left\lvert f'(t)\right\rvert\leqslant C \left\lvert f(t)\right\rvert$, we get
$$\tag{**}   \left\lvert f(x)\right\rvert \leqslant C\int_a^x \left\lvert f(t)\right\rvert\mathrm dt\leqslant C(x-a)\sup_{s\in (a,b)} \left\lvert f(s)\right\rvert.$$
Now, going back to $(*)$ we have 
$$\left\lvert f(x)\right\rvert \leqslant \int_a^x\left\lvert f'(t)\right\rvert\mathrm dt\leqslant C\int_a^x\left\lvert f(t)\right\rvert\mathrm dt       $$
and using (**) with $t$ instead of $x$, we get that 
$$\left\lvert f(x)\right\rvert\leqslant\frac 12  C^2(x-a)^2\sup_{s\in (a,b)} \left\lvert f(s)\right\rvert.$$
This suggests that for any $n$, there exists $c_n$ such that for any $x\in (a,b)$, $ \left\lvert f(x)\right\rvert  \leqslant c_n\left(x-a\right)^n$, where $c_n$ has to be determined.   We will find that $c_n=C^n/n! \sup_{s\in (a,b)} \left\lvert f(s)\right\rvert$ does the job.</p>
"
"2394847","2394863","<p>Of course, we can use the fundamental theorem of calculus in a more direct way. Let $0 &lt; \lvert h\rvert &lt; 1-\frac{1}{n}$ and $x\in [0, 1]$. Then, \begin{align*} \frac{f_n(x+h)-f_n(h)}{h} &amp;= \frac{n}{2h}\left[\int_{x+h-1/n}^{x+h+1/n} f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t-\int_{x-1/n}^{x+1/n} f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t\right] \\ &amp;= \frac{n}{2h}\left[\int_{x+1/n}^{x+h+1/n} f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t-\int_{x-1/n}^{x+h-1/n} f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t\right] \end{align*} so $$\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f_n(x+h)-f_n(h)}{h} = \frac{n}{2}[f(x+1/n)-f(x-1/n)]$$ by the FTC. Therefore, $f_n'(x) = \frac{n}{2}[f(x+1/n)-f(x-1/n)]$ for $x\in [0, 1]$.</p>

"2394852","2394934","<p>First, one should have in mind that for a finite-degree separable field extension $L/K$, the <em>trace</em> <em>pairing</em> $\langle x,y\rangle={\mathrm tr}^L_K xy$ is <em>non-degenerate</em>. Here the trace is Galois trace, which, notably, does not depend on the extension being Galois. Rather, ${\mathrm tr}x$ is the sum, in a Galois closure of $L$ over $K$, of all the conjugates of $x$... which, by Galois theory, lies in the ground field $K$, in fact.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, for a finite (unavoidably separable, because characteristic is $0$) extension $k/\mathbb Q_p$, trace is non-degenerate, and is ""sum of conjugates"". An often unasked question amounts to comparison of the ""global trace"" (of number field $K/\mathbb Q$) to the <em>local</em> traces $K_v/\mathbb Q_p$, where $v$ runs through places/primes of $K$ lying over $p$. A very useful point, too-often mistakenly suppressed because it's ""not sufficiently elementary"", is that $K\otimes_{\mathbb Q} \mathbb Q_p\approx \bigoplus_{v/p} K_v$. In this context, it is not at all surprising that ""the global trace is the sum of the local traces"".</p>

<p>And, yes, for number field extensions $K/k$ and for local field extensions $K/k$, the <em>inverse</em> different is the fractional-ideal inverse of $\{x\in K: {\mathrm tr}x\mathfrak o_K\subset \mathfrak o_k\}$. In both cases, in addition to giving a duality by the trace pairing, there are strong connections to ramification.</p>

<p>(Also, I'd suggest that K. Iwasawa be mentioned in this context, since, after all, he gave an ICM talk in 1950 about doing this sort of thing. Not to mention Matchett's 1946 thesis under Artin about similar matters. ""It was in the air."")</p>

"2394853","2394904","<p>First, a general observation: if a finite measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}$ has no atoms, then the diagonal $\{(x,x)\in\mathbb{R}^2\}$ has zero measure with respect to the product measure $\mu\times \mu$. To see why, partition $\mathbb R$ into $n$ intervals of measure $1/n$, and observe that the diagonal is covered by $n$ squares, each of which gets product measure $1/n^2$.  </p>

<p>So we integrate over $x\ne y$; by symmetry, it suffices to integrate over $x&lt;y$. Write $x,y$ in base-3 as </p>

<p>$$x = 0.\underset{n \text{ digits}}{\underbrace{\cdots}} 0\cdots , \quad y = 0.\underset{\text{same digits}}{\underbrace{\cdots}} 2\cdots $$
where $n$ is a nonnegative integer. Note that $|x-y|\ge 3^{-n-1}$. Also, the measure of all pairs $(x,y)$ as above is 
$$
2^{n}(1/2)^{2(n+1)} = \frac14\cdot 2^{-n}
$$
because there are $2^n$ choices of $n$ digits of $x$, and because fixing the first $(n+1)$ digits of a number restricts it to a subset of measure $(1/2)^{n+1}$. </p>

<p>Putting it all together, 
$$
\iint_{x&lt;y} |x-y|^{-s}\,d\mu(x)\,d\mu(y) \le \sum_{n=0}^\infty 3^{s(n+1)} \frac14\cdot 2^{-n}  = \frac{3^s}{4} \sum_{n=0}^\infty (3^s/2)^n

We want to show $f(x) &gt;0$ and $g(x) &gt; 0$ for $x &gt; 0$.</p>

<p>Notice that $f$ and its first four derivatives vanish at $x=0$.  If $f$ has a positive zero, say $f(a_0) = 0$, then by Rolle's Theorem $f'$ has a zero $a_1$ with $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_0$.  Repeating this argument, we have $0 &lt; a_4 &lt; a_3 &lt; a_2 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_0$ with $f^{(n)}(a_n) = 0$.  Since $f^{(4)}(x) = \sin x$, we must have $\pi \le a_4$, so $\pi &lt; a_0$.

"2394885","2394917","<p>In the category of pointed sets, $A\to A\amalg B\to B$ is always exact, but coproducts and products are not isomorphic.  What you can say is that if $A\to A\amalg B\to B$ is always exact, then the natural map $A\amalg B\to A\times B$ always has trivial kernel.  Indeed, the kernel of $A\amalg B\to A\times B$ is just the pullback of the kernels of the two component maps $A\amalg B\to A$ and $A\amalg B\to B$, which by assumption are the inclusions $i:A\to A\amalg B$ and $j:B\to A\amalg B$.  Now suppose $f:C\to A$ and $g:C\to B$ are maps such that $if=jg$.  Composing $if=jg$ with the map $(1,0):A\amalg B\to A$ we find $f=(1,0)if=(1,0)jg=0$.  Similarly, $g=0$.  This shows that the pullback of $i$ and $j$ is $0$, as desired.</p>

<p>As for a unital example, I believe you can take the category of all monoids with the property that $xy=1$ implies $x=1$ and $y=1$.  Such monoids are closed under limits and coproducts, and $A\to A\amalg B\to B$ is always exact for them.  The map $A\amalg B\to A\times B$ is not typically an isomorphism for such monoids though: it is surjective and has trivial kernel, but it is not injective.</p>
"
"2394888","2394895","<p>First, some definitions:  </p>

<p>The ""solutions of a polynomial equation"" in, say, the variable $x$ is the set of values of $x$ that make that equation true.  For example, the solutions of 
$$
x^3 -5x^2 -2x +24 = 0
$$
are $\{x=-2, x=3, x=4\}$ and we know this because 
$$
x^3 -5x^2 -2x +24 = (x-(-2))(x-3)(x-4)
$$
Second definition:  The ""negatives of the solutions"" is the set of values each of which is the negative of one of the values in the set of solutions.  In our example, the negatives of the solutions would be 
$$\{x=+2, x=-3, x=-4\}$$</p>

<p>And now you can see what happens to make the ""constant term"", that is, the term not involving $x$, [which is 24 in our example] equal to the product of the negatives of the solutions.  Each of the solutions $-2, 3$, and $4$ appears in our product of factors as being <strong>subtracted from</strong> x.  So the constant term is the product of the negatives of the solutions.</p>

The statement ""$f(t)$ is $O(p)$"" does not say $p$ is the <em>sharpest</em> bound you can get, but it does imply a minimal degree of sharpness. As a result, it is best to read the statement as guaranteeing a minimal degree of vanishing, not specifying the best possible bound. That is why your book tells you to call this property vanishing to ""at least"" order $p$: they don't want you to make the mistake of thinking the order is exactly $p$.</p>

<p>Just look at a concrete example. Say you know $|f|$ is bounded by a constant times $t^2$. This means $|f|$ is also bounded by a constant times $|t|$, because $t^2&lt;|t|$ for small nonzero $t$. But you don't know whether you can do better and bound $|f|$ by a higher-order power.</p>

<p>While many categorical approaches to characterizing concepts are not presented in a first-order manner, it's not unusual that they <em>can</em> be presented in a first-order manner. So the characterization of categorical products in terms of representability is not patently first-order but the characterization of categorical products in terms of universal arrows (""universal properties"") is given a fairly standard axiomatization of the notion of a category. So you simply take the universal properties as axioms. <a href=""https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/fully+formal+ETCS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This nLab page</a> describes an axiomatization of ETCS (the elementary theory of the category of sets) which includes axiomatizing categorical products, or in this particular axiomatizations case, pullbacks and a terminal object.</p>

<p>Simplifying the axioms there for pullbacks to products (which are just pullbacks along arrows into the terminal object) and using their notation and conventions produces (if I didn't make a mistake):
$$\begin{align}a=s(a),b=s(b)\vdash\exists_h\exists_k\forall_{h'}\forall_{k'}&amp;((t(h')=a\land t(k')=b \land s(h')=s(k'))\\&amp;\Rightarrow \exists!_j(c(h,j,h')\land c(k,j,k')))\end{align}$$
The postulated $h$ and $k$ correspond to the categorical product, in particular to the projection $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$. This particular axiomatization uses an arrows-only formulation of category theory so there is no product object, instead the identity arrow $s(h) = s(k)$, corresponding to the source of $h$ and $k$, represents the object.</p>

<p>In something like <a href=""https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/FOLDS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FOLDS</a>, you would have an axiom like:
$$\begin{align}A,B:\mathsf{Ob}\vdash\ &amp;\exists P:\mathsf{Ob}.\exists h:\mathsf{Hom}(P,A).\exists k:\mathsf{Hom}(P,B).\\&amp;\forall X:\mathsf{Ob}.\forall h':\mathsf{Hom}(X,A).\forall k':\mathsf{Hom}(X,B).\\&amp;\exists!j:\mathsf{Hom}(X,P).h'=h\circ j \land k' = k\circ j\end{align}$$</p>

"2394972","2395254","<p>Each qubit can be thought of as a vector in $\mathbb{C}^2$, and a system of many qubits lives in the tensor product of some copies of $\mathbb{C}^2$. For example, a three qubit system lives in $\mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2$.

<p>Gates such as $X: \mathbb{C}^2 \to \mathbb{C}^2$ can only be applied to a single qubit, and somehow you have to ""lift"" them into position so you can apply them to the correct qubit in a three qubit system.

If you've seen physics, this is the motivation for the Bra-Ket notation: in the expression $\langle a | b \rangle$, $\langle a |$ is a row vector and $| b \rangle$ is a column vector.  Together, $\langle a | b \rangle = \langle a |\text{ } | b \rangle$.</p>

<p>This might seem a little silly right now, since covectors very clearly correspond to normal vectors, but that's not always the case (for example, in the infinite-dimensional spaces studied in functional analysis).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the form $$a{\bf\hat{i}} + b {\bf\hat{j}} + c {\bf\hat{k}}$$ is exactly the same as $$\begin{bmatrix}a\\ b\\ c\end{bmatrix}$$</p>

<p>I suppose the former notation is more succint in handwriting, but I've always found column vectors to be more illustrative -- you can easily tell the difference between vectors and scalars this way.  That said, the choice between the two is ultimately a matter of convenience.</p>

We already ran into trouble with this one; do we therefore have to make special rules restricting the operations we can perform on arbitrary polynomials, just in case we decide to put one equal to some positive number when ordinary arithmetic would reduce it to the zero polynomial?</p>

we have trouble even with arithmetic we used to do with ordinary numbers.
I realize all of the above doesn't answer the main question (whether there's a foolproof way to tell which properties are ""safe"" for $\omega$),

"2394980","2395081","<p>I have no reference, but it seems to me fairly straightforward that monadic FOL would be decidable: If you only have monadic predicates, and given that any sentence in monadic FOL would have only a finite number of monadic predicates (say $n$), then you can distinguish at most $2^n$ different 'kinds' of objects in terms of them having or not having the property as expressed by the predicate for each of the $n$ predicates. And without being able to express identity (which requires an at least 2-place relation), you cannot express that there are at least two of a certain 'kind'. Ergo: if there are no models for a sentence with $2^n$ objects in its domain, then there are no models either with more than $2^n$ objects in its domain. So, to see whether some sentence is a monadic FOL valid sentence, just check see if there is a model for its negation with $2^n$ objects: if ao, then the sentence is not valid, but if not, then it is.</p>

<p>Now, onto the question.
We need to prove that $\sim$ is reflexive ($A\sim A$ for all $A\in\mathsf{M}_n$), symmetric ($A\sim B$ implies $B\sim A$), and transitive ($A\sim B$ and $B\sim C$ implies $A\sim C$).</p>

<p>For transitivity, assume $A\sim B$ and $B\sim C$. Then there are invertible matrices $S$ and $T$ such that $A=SBS^{-1}$ and $B=TCT^{-1}$. Then $ST$ is invertible and

A = SBS^{-1} = S(TCT^{-1})S^{-1} = (ST)C(ST)^{-1},

so $A\sim C$.</p>

<p>$$\vec 0\in D\implies\int_Df(\vec x)\delta(\vec x)d\vec x=f(\vec 0)$$</p>

<p>However, in this case $f(0)$ is undefined. This means that we can't generally consider this integral to be well-defined. Luckily, since the rational function of integration is bounded and continuous almost everywhere, we can still integrate it over regions containing the origin, but we'll have to treat the delta a bit more carefully (and perhaps a bit less rigorously).</p>

<p>To begin with, consider the surface of an $N$-sphere or radius $R$ centered at the origin, which I'll denote $\Sigma(R)$, with an associated $N-1$ dimensional volume differential $d\sigma$. We know the volume of this region is the surface volume of an $N$-sphere.</p>

<p>$$\int_{\Sigma(R)}d\sigma=S_{N-1}R^{N-1}$$</p>

<p>Where $S_{N-1}=\frac{2\pi^{N/2}}{\Gamma(N/2)}$ is the sphere surface constant. Since $\vec x\cdot\vec x= R^2$ everywhere in $\Sigma(R)$, we can write the following integral.</p>

<p>$$\int_{\Sigma(R)}\vec x\cdot\vec x\ d\sigma=S_{N-1}R^{N+1}$$</p>

<p>Using Euclidean coordinates:</p>

<p>$$\int_{\Sigma(R)}(x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_N^2)d\sigma=S_{N-1}R^{N+1}$$</p>

<p>$$\int_{\Sigma(R)}x_1^2\ d\sigma+\int_{\Sigma(R)}x_2^2\ d\sigma+...+\int_{\Sigma(R)}x_N^2\ d\sigma=S_{N-1}R^{N+1}$$</p>

<p>Due to symmetry, we know each of the integrals must have the same value.</p>

<p>$$\int_{\Sigma(R)}x_i^2\ d\sigma=\frac{S_{N-1}}{N}R^{N+1}\tag{1}$$</p>

<p>With this identity, we can integrate our function on $\Sigma(R)$.</p>

<p>$$\int_{\Sigma(R)}\frac{\vec x^TA\vec x}{\vec x^T\vec x}d\sigma$$</p>

<p>The denominator is is the constant $R^2$ everywhere in $\Sigma(R)$.</p>

<p>$$=\frac{1}{R^2}\int_{\Sigma(R)}\vec x^TA\vec x\ d\sigma$$</p>

<p>$$=\frac{1}{R^2}\int_{\Sigma(R)}(\alpha_1x_1^2+\alpha_2x_2^2+...+\alpha_Nx_N^2)d\sigma$$</p>

<p>Now we just have a linear combination of the integrals from $(1)$.</p>

<p>$$\int_{\Sigma(R)}\frac{\vec x^TA\vec x}{\vec x^T\vec x}d\sigma=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\alpha_i}{N}S_{N-1}R^{N-1}\tag{2}$$</p>

<p>This essentially tells us that the average value of the rational function on $\Sigma(R)$ is the constant $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\alpha_i}{N}$ for any $R&gt;0$. Now if we let $B(R)$ be a ball of radius $R$ centered at the origin, we can integrate the rational function on $B(R)$ by switching to polar coordinates.</p>

<p>$$\int_{B(R)}\frac{\vec x^TA\vec x}{\vec x^T\vec x}d\vec x=\int_0^R\int_{\Sigma(r)}\frac{\vec x^TA\vec x}{\vec x^T\vec x}d\sigma\ dr$$</p>

<p>Using $(2)$:</p>

<p>$$=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\alpha_i}{N}\int_0^RS_{N-1}r^{N-1}dr$$</p>

<p>The integral is simply the volume of an $N$-sphere, which we can write using the volume constant $V_N=\frac{\pi^{N/2}}{\Gamma(N/2+1)}$.</p>

<p>$$\int_{B(R)}\frac{\vec x^TA\vec x}{\vec x^T\vec x}d\vec x=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\alpha_i}{N}V_Nr^N\tag{3}$$</p>

<p>We can think of the Dirac delta as the limit of a sequence of symmetric distributions centered about the origin that integrate to $1$. In particular, consider the following set of distributions:</p>

<p>$$\Delta_R(\vec x)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{V_NR^N} &amp; \vec x\in B(R) \\
0                &amp; \vec x\notin B(R)
\end{cases}$$</p>

<p>Each of these has the properties mentioned above, and additionally they become increasingly localized around the origin as $R\to 0^+$. Because of this, I'll claim that the following definition is equivalent to the other definitions of the multivariate Dirac delta. (this can be justified more thoroughly, but I'll just note that both will converge to $f(\vec 0)$, provided $f$ is continuous there.)</p>

<p>$$\int_Df(\vec x)\delta(\vec x)d\vec x\equiv\lim_{R\to 0^+}\int_Df(\vec x)\Delta_R(\vec x)d\vec x$$</p>

<p>Importantly, this definition no longer requires that $f$ be continuous at $\vec 0$. We can therefore use it to evaluate the integral of interest.</p>

<p>$$\int_{\mathbb R^N}\frac{\vec x^TA\vec x}{\vec x^T\vec x}\delta(\vec x)d\vec x=\lim_{R\to 0^+}\int_{\mathbb R^N}\frac{\vec x^TA\vec x}{\vec x^T\vec x}\Delta_R(\vec x)d\vec x$$</p>

<p>$$=\lim_{R\to 0^+}\frac{1}{V_NR^N}\int_{B(R)}\frac{\vec x^TA\vec x}{\vec x^T\vec x}d\vec x$$</p>

<p>Noticing that the integral above appears in $(3)$:</p>

<p>$$=\lim_{R\to 0^+}\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\alpha_i}{N}$$</p>

<p>$$\int_{\mathbb R^N}\frac{\vec x^TA\vec x}{\vec x^T\vec x}\delta(\vec x)d\vec x=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\alpha_i}{N}$$</p>

<p>The reason this result is ""not rigorous"" is because treating the Dirac delta as a limit of distributions is very problematic here. If $f$ is continuous at the origin then the equality</p>

<p>$$\int_Df(\vec x)\delta(\vec x)d\vec x=\lim_{R\to 0^+}\int_Df(\vec x)\Delta_R(\vec x)d\vec x$$</p>

<p>holds or a wide class of well-behaved distributions. However, when we allow $f$ to be discontinuous at the origin, different distributions will give different results. In general, I believe the following can be derived.</p>

<p>$$\liminf_{\epsilon\to 0^+}\{f(\vec x):|\vec x|&lt;\epsilon\}\le\lim_{R\to 0^+}\int_Df(\vec x)\Delta_R(\vec x)d\vec x\le\limsup_{\epsilon\to 0^+}\{f(\vec x):|\vec x|&lt;\epsilon\}$$</p>

<p>Thus a different choice of distributions could have resulted in a result of $\min\{\alpha_i\}$ or $\max\{\alpha_i\}$. If we arbitrarily limit ourselves to spherically symmetric distributions, the definition is no longer inconsistent, but we now aren't talking about the standard delta function, but an entirely new function that no longer ""sees"" $f(0)$, but instead the spherically symmetric average of $f$ in the vicinity of $0$. This function is equivalent to the delta for continuous functions and defined for all locally bounded almost everywhere continuous function. By using it, we aren't computing the integral you posed (which is ill-defined), but rather a very similar looking, but arbitrarily chosen integral. Whether this result is useful at all depends on where the integral comes from.</p>

"2395129","2395160","<p>Yes, your proof is correct.  A few comments:</p>

<p>Another method of solution would be to use the angle addition identity to write $$ \sin (a+bi) = \sin a \cos bi + \cos a \sin bi = \sin a \cosh b + i \cos a \sinh b,$$
from which we conclude that $(a,b) \in \mathbb R^2$ must satisfy $$\sin a \cosh b = 2, \\ \cos a \sinh b = 0.$$  Since $\sinh b = 0$ if and only if $b = 0$, and $\cos a = 0$ if and only if $a \in \frac{\pi}{2} + \pi k$ for $k \in \mathbb Z$, we have two cases.  The first case is impossible:  if $b = 0$, then $\cosh b = 1$ and $\sin a = 2$ has no solutions for $a \in \mathbb R$.  So we must have instead $$\cosh b = 2 \csc \left(\frac{\pi}{2} + \pi k\right) = 2(-1)^k.$$  Since $\cosh b \ge 1$, it follows that $k$ must be even, and we get $b = \pm \cosh^{-1} 2$, and our solution set is $$a+bi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi m \pm i \cosh^{-1} 2, \quad m \in \mathbb Z.$$  It is worth observing that $\cosh^{-1} 2 = \ln(2 + \sqrt{3}).$</p>

We easily get the result that all singular values of $E$ are at most $\frac n2$.  Moreover, we could note that in general,

In language, for instance, there is no reason why one word should statistically appear in similar contexts to, say, the one next to it, alphabetically. 
Hence the explosion of parameters above. Continuous distributions, by assumption, don't have this issue.</p>

<p>More concretely, our problem above had $|V|^n-1$ parameters to characterize the joint distribution of $n$ variables, in the discrete case. Let's suppose we have an RV $X_i$ that takes values in $\mathbb{R}^d$ rather than $V$. At first glance, this seems to be <em>harder</em> since the number of possible values in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is larger than $|V|$ (even for $d=1$). However, what if we think that the joint distribution of $X=(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ is well approximated by a Gaussian mixture model? Then we need only specify $k$ (number of Gaussians), $W$ (vector of weights, $|W|=k$), the means $\mu_j\in\mathbb{R}^d$, and the covariances $\sigma\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$. This is only on the order of $k+k(nd+n^2d^2)$, roughly speaking. This is comparatively quite small! Much of the reason for this is that large patches of space are assumed to have probabilities smoothly varying compared to their neighbors; hence, one requires many fewer parameters to characterize large patches of space. (Even the largest deep neural networks have nowhere near close to ${\sim}10^{50}$ parameters! Hence why we prefer to do NLP in ""continuous spaces"" by embedding them).</p>

"2395463","2397321","<p>As has been pointed out in the comments, the rotation matrix that you built rotates about the origin, but you need to rotate the rectangle about some other point. A systematic way to deal with this would be to first translate the center of rotation to the origin, rotate, and then translate the result into its final position.  </p>

<p>Since you’re specifying the rectangle positions by their centers, we’ll rotate about the center of the rectangle. So, we first translate by $(-1,-2)$, rotate 90° conterclockwise, as you’ve done, and translate to the final position: $$\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;0&amp;4\\0&amp;1&amp;5\\0&amp;0&amp;1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;-1&amp;0\\1&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;0&amp;-1\\0&amp;1&amp;-2\\0&amp;0&amp;1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;-1&amp;6\\1&amp;0&amp;4\\0&amp;0&amp;1\end{bmatrix}.\tag1$$ We check: $$\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;-1&amp;6\\1&amp;0&amp;4\\0&amp;0&amp;1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}2\\4\\1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}2\\6\\1\end{bmatrix}.$$ I’ll leave the other corners for you to verify.  </p>

<p>You can save having to do one of the matrix multiplications by skipping the first translation. Applying the rotation to the rectangle rotates it about the origin—its lower-left corner—so the necessary translation to then apply is the one that takes this new center to the target. The rotated center is $(-2,1)$, so the necessary translation is now $(4,5)-(-2,1)=(6,4)$, which, not coincidentally, is the last column of the matrix derived in (1). To see why this might be so, you can write and multiply these matrices in block form: $$\left[\begin{array}{c|c}I_2&amp;\mathbf c_2 \\ \hline \mathbf 0^T&amp;1 \end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c|c}R &amp; \mathbf 0 \\ \hline \mathbf 0^T&amp;1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c|c}I_2&amp;-\mathbf c_1 \\ \hline \mathbf 0^T&amp;1\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c|c}R &amp; \mathbf c_2-R\mathbf c_1 \\ \hline \mathbf 0^T&amp;1 \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c|c}I_2 &amp; \mathbf c_2-R\mathbf c_1 \\ \hline \mathbf 0^T&amp;1 \end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c|c}R &amp; 0 \\ \hline \mathbf 0^T&amp;1 \end{array}\right].$$ Here, $I_2$ is the $2\times2$ identity matrix, $R$ is the $2\times2$ rotation matrix, and $\mathbf c_1$ and $\mathbf c_2$ are the respective rectangle centers. In the process, we’ve also shown that a translate-rotate-translate sequence is equivalent to a rotate-translate sequence.  </p>

<p>Now, there’s a quicker way to build the transformation matrix that you’re looking for by using an important property of transformation matrices: their columns are the images of the basis vectors, but that’s getting ahead of where you appear to be in this subject.</p>

<p>Note that since you haven’t specified how the vertices of the original rectangle correspond to those of the target, there are several other rigid motions (a.k.a. isometries) that will map one onto the other. For instance, you could rotate the rectangle in the opposite direction. That will also change the translation component of the transformation. Or, you could reflect the rectangle—flip it over—in various ways to get it aligned the right way.</p>

"2395499","2395555","<p>For the first part, let $F_t : [0, 1] \times X \to X$ be a transformation given by the formula $F_t(p) = (1-t) \cdot p$. It is continuous, $F_0 = \operatorname{id}_X$ and $F_1(p) = 0$ for all $p \in X$. </p>

<p>Let $G_t : [0, 1] \times X \to X$ be a transformation given by $G_t( p ) = t \cdot \pi_x(p)$ where $\pi_x : X \to I$ is the orthogonal projection. Then $G_t$ is continuous, $G_0(p) = 0$ for all $p \in X$ and $G_1[X] = I$. </p>

<p>Clearly the composition of these two transformations is a deformation retraction of $X$ onto $I$.</p>

<p>Intuitively, we pull everything to $0$ in the first phase and expand it to $I$ in the second phase.</p>

<hr>

<p>For the second part, suppose $H : [0, 1] \times X \to X$ is a strong deformation retraction onto $I$. Since </p>

<p>$$V = \left\{ (x, y) \in X : x &gt; \frac{1}{2} \right\}$$</p>

<p>is an open neighbourhood of the point $\left&lt; 1, 0 \right&gt;$ in $X$, the preimage $G = H^{-1}[V]$ is open. Moreover $[0, 1] \times \{ \left&lt; 1, 0 \right&gt; \} \subseteq G$ because $H$ is a strong deformation. By compactness of $[0, 1]$, there is open neighbourhood $U \subseteq X$ of $\left&lt; 1, 0 \right&gt;$ such that $[0, 1] \times U \subseteq G$. </p>

<p>Let $p \in U \setminus I$, specifically $p \in U \cap I_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $I_n$ is the segment with slope $\frac{1}{n}$. Now $H \big[ [0, 1] \times \{ p \} \big]$ is a connected subset of $X$, and also a subset of $V$, so it must be a subset of the connected component of $H( 0, p ) = p$ in $V$ which is $V \cap I_n$. So $H(1, p) \in V \cap I_n$, thus $H(1, p) \notin I$ which is a contradiction.</p>

<p>Intuitively, if $I$ is fixed by $H$ throughout time, a small neighbourhood of $\left&lt; 1, 0 \right&gt;$ must stay close to $\left&lt; 1, 0 \right&gt;$ during the transformation, but it can't end up being moved to $I$ without going through the origin, which is far from $\left&lt; 1, 0 \right&gt;$.</p>

"2395529","2395761","<p>Perron-Frobenius theorem asserts more than what you said in your first bullet point. In fact, when $A$ is irreducible (this includes the special case where $A$ is positive), $r=\rho(A)$, the spectral radius of $A$, is a <strong>simple</strong>, <strong>positive</strong> and <strong>dominant</strong> eigenvalue of $A$, and $A$ has a positive left-eigenvector and a positive right-eigenvector for this eigenvalue. (It follows that even when $A$ has more than one positive eigenvalues, $\rho(A)$ is the only eigenvalue that has a positive left/right-eigenvector. So, in your first bullet point, we are not talking about just any positive eigenvalue of $A$, but specifically the spectral radius $\rho(A)$.)</p>

<p>This means $A/r$ has a Jordan decomposition $A/r=P(1\oplus J)P^{-1}$, where $J$ is a Jordan normal form whose eigenvalues all have magnitudes <strong>strictly smaller</strong> than $1$. Let the first column of $P$ be $v$ and the first row of $P^{-1}$ be $w$. Then $v$ and $w$ are respectively right- and left-eigenvectors of $A$ for the eigenvalue $1$ and $w^Tv=1$.</p>

<p>It is well known that we can always make the super-diagonal of any non-trivial Jordan block arbitrarily small via a similarity transform using a diagonal matrix. That is, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, we can always pick a diagonal matrix $D$ (e.g. $D=\operatorname{diag}(1,\epsilon,\epsilon^2,\ldots,\epsilon^{n-1})$) such that $1\oplus J=D(1\oplus B)D^{-1}$ for some bidiagonal matrix $B$ whose diagonal entries (i.e. eigenvalues) are exactly those of $J$ and whose super-diagonal entries all lie inside $[0,\epsilon]$. Therefore, when $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small, the induced $\infty$-norm of $B$ (i.e. $\|B\|_\infty=\max_i\sum_j|b_{ij}|$) is strictly smaller than $1$. So, we see that $\lim_{k\to\infty} B^k=0$ and in turn

"2395602","2395790","<p>The general recipe for answering such questions is based on a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-elimination_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cut-elimination theorem</a>. The authors state in footnote 28 that the $Cut$ rule is ""admissible"" for this calculus, which is another way to say that it can be eliminated.[*] To decide whether $\bigcirc A \to \bigcirc B \vdash \bigcirc (A \to B)$ is provable, it therefore suffices to ask, ""Does it have a cut-free proof?""</p>

<p>Now, any cut-free proof of $\bigcirc A \to \bigcirc B \vdash \bigcirc (A \to B)$ must necessarily end in either ${\to}L$ or ${\bigcirc}R$, as in one of the following proof attempts:
$$
 \frac{\vdash \bigcirc A \qquad \bigcirc B \vdash \bigcirc (A \to B)}{\bigcirc A \to \bigcirc B \vdash \bigcirc (A \to B)} {\to}L
\qquad
 \frac{\bigcirc A \to \bigcirc B \vdash A \to B}{\bigcirc A \to \bigcirc B \vdash \bigcirc (A \to B)} {\bigcirc}R
$$
The first possibility can be immediately eliminated because it is not possible to prove $\vdash \bigcirc A$ for arbitrary $A$ (take $A$ to be any atomic formula). The second possibility can likewise be eliminated through a bit more case analysis of cut-free proofs: eventually we would be required to prove $\bigcirc B \vdash B$, but this is not possible for general $B$.</p>

<p>Therefore, $\bigcirc A \to \bigcirc B \vdash \bigcirc (A \to B)$ is not provable for general $A$ and $B$.</p>

<p>[*] technically, a rule is <em>admissible</em> for a sequent calculus if given derivations of the premises, we can construct a derivation of the conclusion without using the rule itself. In particular, the $Cut$ rule is admissible if given cut-free derivations of $\Gamma \vdash B$ and $B, \Delta \vdash C$, we can always construct a cut-free derivation of $\Gamma,\Delta \vdash C$.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Of course, the extra bit of reasoning which is missing from this argument is the proof of cut-elimination itself which the authors claim in the footnote.

"
"2395699","2396858","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> You are correct.</p>

<p>So, in <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/793755/given-that-xy-yx-what-could-x-and-y-be?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1"">the question you were already given the link to</a>, it is stated that $$f(x) = -\frac x{\ln x}W\left(-\frac{\ln x}x\right),$$</p>

<p>however, it is bit imprecise, because $W$ is multivalued function, with its branches denoted with $W_0$ and $W_{-1}$ and thus, if you were to plot $f$ this way in some software that has <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lambert W-function</a> implemented, you would get the same graph as by plotting $x^y-y^x=0.$</p>

<p>Thus, the first step would be to eliminate the line $y=x$ to get your $g$.</p>

<p>We will use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function#Identities"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">identities</a> </p>

<p>\begin{align}
W_0(xe^x) = x,&amp;\ x\geq -1,\\
W_{-1}(xe^x) = x,&amp;\ x\leq -1,
\end{align}</p>

<p>to identify which branch in the above definition of $f$ we need to use:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
f(x) = x &amp;\iff -\frac x{\ln x}W\left(-\frac{\ln x}x\right) = x\\
&amp;\iff W\left(te^t\right) = t,\ x = e^{-t}
\end{align}</p>

<p>By the above identities, we need to use $W_{-1}$ when $t\geq -1$ and $W_{0}$ when $t\leq -1$ to avoid $f(x) = x$. Substituting back with $x$, we get the following definition of $f$:</p>

<p>$$f(x) = \begin{cases}
-\frac x{\ln x}W_{-1}\left(-\frac{\ln x}x\right),\ 0&lt;x&lt; e,\\
-\frac x{\ln x}W_{0}\left(-\frac{\ln x}x\right),\ x\geq e,
\end{cases}$$</p>

<p>but here is the thing, $W_{-1}\left(-\frac{\ln x}x\right)$ is not defined on whole $(0,e)$. The reason is that $W_{-1}$ is only defined on $[-1/e,0)$, so we need to solve $-1/e \leq -\ln x/x &lt; 0$. We get that $x&gt;1$ so the correct definition of $f$ is </p>

<p>$$f(x) = \begin{cases}
-\frac x{\ln x}W_{-1}\left(-\frac{\ln x}x\right),\ \color{blue}{1&lt;x&lt; e},\\
-\frac x{\ln x}W_{0}\left(-\frac{\ln x}x\right),\ x\geq e.
\end{cases}$$</p>

<p>Finally, we can now give precise definition of $g$ as well (using $x^y = e^{y\ln x}$):</p>

<p>$$g(x) = \begin{cases}
\exp\left(-xW_{-1}\left(-\frac{\ln x}x\right)\right),\ 1&lt;x&lt; e,\\
\exp\left(-xW_{0}\left(-\frac{\ln x}x\right)\right),\ x\geq e.
\end{cases}$$</p>

<hr>

<p>Let us analize what is happening on $(1,e)$. We want to prove that $-xW_{-1}\left(-\frac{\ln x}x\right)$ is strictly decreasing on $(1,e)$. Let $u(x) = W_{-1}\left(-\frac{\ln x}x\right)$. By differentiating $-xu(x)$ we get $$-u(x) + \frac{(\ln x - 1)u(x)}{(1+u(x))\ln x}$$ and we want to prove it is strictly negative on $(1,e)$. Having in mind that $0&lt;\ln x&lt; 1$ and $u(x)\leq -1$ on $(1,e)$, we can manipulate the expression to get </p>

<p>$$-u(x) + \frac{(\ln x - 1)u(x)}{(1+u(x))\ln x} &lt; 0\iff u(x)+\frac1{\ln x} &gt; 0.$$</p>

<p>Now, to see this last thing is true involves some trickery which I will skip. It is not as hard as is very tedious. I can write it down if somebody would be interested in that.</p>

<p>We conclude that $-xu(x)$ is strictly decreasing on $(1,e)$ and so is $g(x)$.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, the analysis on $[e,+\infty)$ is much easier. If we denote with $v(x) = W_0\left(-\frac{\ln x}{x}\right)$, then $-1 \leq v(x) &lt; 0$ and $v(x)$ is strictly increasing on $(e,+\infty)$ since both $W_0$ and $-\ln x/x$ are. Calculating derivative of $-xv(x)$ we get </p>

<p>$$-v(x) + \frac{(\ln x - 1)v(x)}{\ln x(1+v(x))}$$</p>

<p>and like the above case, we get that $$-v(x) + \frac{(\ln x - 1)v(x)}{\ln x(1+v(x))}&gt; 0 \iff v(x)\ln x &gt; -1$$ which is true on $(e,+\infty)$ since $v(x)&gt; -1$ and $\ln x&gt; 1$. Thus $-xv(x)$ is strictly increasing on $[e,+\infty)$ and so is $g$.</p>

<hr>

<p>Having done that, it immediately follows that $g$ has minimum at $x = e$, which is easy to calculate: $g(e) = \exp(-e W_0(-e^{-1})) = \exp(-e\cdot (-1)) = e^e.$</p>

<p>Finally, let us check the limits at boundaries:</p>

<p>$$\lim_{x\to 1^+} g(x) = \exp(\lim_{x\to 1^+} (-xu(x))) = \exp(\lim_{x\to 1^+} (-xW_{-1}(-\frac{\ln x}x))) = +\infty$$ because $\lim_{x\to 0^-}W_{-1}(x) = - \infty.$</p>

<p>To verify that $g(x)\sim x$ at $+\infty$:</p>

<p>$$\lim_{x\to+\infty}\frac{g(x)}{x} = \lim_{x\to+\infty}\frac{\exp(-xv(x))}{x} = \exp(\lim_{x\to+\infty}(-xv(x) - \ln x))$$</p>

<p>and to calculate last limit, we can use Taylor expansion of $W_0$ at $0$:</p>

<p>$$\exp(\lim_{x\to+\infty}(-xv(x) - \ln x)) = \exp(\lim_{x\to+\infty}(-x(-\frac{\ln x}{x}-\frac{\ln^2x}{x^2}+\ldots) - \ln x)) = e^0 = 1.$$</p>

<p>However, $\lim_{x\to +\infty}(g(x)-x) = +\infty$.</p>

"
"2395728","2396445","<p>Yes，it is just the definition of the weak solution.  You can use many methods to show the existence of such weak solutions, say Galerkin method, which is exactly what Evans used in his book.  For a vector-valued function $u\in L^p(0,T;X)$, the weak derivative $u'$ is defined as the distribution $T(u)$ such that 
$$
\int_0^T T(u)vdt=-\int_0^T u v' dt\quad \forall v\in C_c^\infty((0,T)).
$$
Then we define $W^{1,p}(0,T;X)=\{u\in L^p(0,T;X); u'\in L^p(0,T;X)\}$. $ u'\in L^p(0,T;X)$ if and only if  there exits a $L^p$ function $u'$ such that for any $f\in X'$, the function $t\to \langle f, u(t)\rangle$ is absolutely continuous, and $\langle f, u'\rangle=\frac{d}{dt}\langle f, u(t)\rangle$. </p>

<p>I suppose the sectional curvature $R$ actually means Riemann curvature instead, since sectional curvatures are usually defined on planes in tangent spaces intead of on $\ts^4T_xM .$</p>

<p>First note that $\om^i\w\om^j\w \Om^i_j$ is a $4$-form, and this is where the four inputs $i,j,k,l$ come from. By the shuffle definition of wedge product, we have $$\om^i\w\om^j(e_m,e_n)=\om^i(e_m)\om^j(e_n)-\om^i(e_n)\om^j(e_m)=\e^{ij}_{mn},$$ where $\e^{ij}_{mn}=1$ when $(m,n)=(i,j),$ $-1$ when $(m,n)=(j,i),$ and $0$ otherwise. </p>

<p>We know that $\Om^i_j(X,Y)=-R(X,Y,e_i,e_j),$
so for $i,j,k,l$ distinct we have
\begin{align*}
0=-&amp;\om^i\w\om^j\w \Om^i_j(e_i,e_j,e_k,e_l)\\=&amp;\sum_{\si\in Sh_{2,2}}(-1)^\si\om^i\w\om^j(e_{\si(i)},e_{\si(j)})R(e_{\si(k)},e_{\si(l)},e_i,e_j)\\
=&amp;R(e_k,e_l,e_i,e_j)\\
=&amp;R(e_i,e_j,e_k,e_l),
\end{align*}
where $Sh_{2,2}$ means $(2,2)$ shuffles, i.e., $\si(i)&lt;\si(j),\si(k)&lt;\si(l).$ 
$\newcommand{\np}{\wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc}$
Now, we have
\begin{align*}
W=R-\frac{1}{n-2}(Ric-\frac{S}{n}g)\wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc g-\frac{S}{2(n-2)}g\np g.
\end{align*}
By definition of Kulkarni-Nomizu product $\wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc,$ we have $T\np g(e_i,e_j,e_k,e_l)=0$ for any 2-tensor $T$ and distinct $i,j,k,l.$ This yields the desired result
$$W(e_i,e_j,e_k,e_l)=0.$$</p>

"
"2395751","2395811","<p>You can't remove a position just because it leaves a win for the opponent.  The main idea behind combinatorial game theory (not emphasized in most expositions on the subject, but it is implicit in how the definitions are set up) is that the value of a game $G$ tells us not only how to play $G$, but also how to play $G + X$ for <em>any</em> game $X$. We can only remove a move from $G$ without changing its value if that move would not be a good move in $G + X$ for <em>any</em> game $X$.  </p>

<p>So how do we simplify a game?  In general, there are two ways of simplifying games: Deleting dominated positions, reversing reversible positions.  This is discussed in ONAG, Chapter 10, Theorem 68.</p>

<p>In your example for $\uparrow + \mbox{ }\ast$, everything is correct up to this form:</p>

<p>$$G = \{\ast,\uparrow|\:0,\uparrow\}$$</p>

<p>On the right side of $G$, we can indeed remove $\uparrow$, but the reason isn't because $\uparrow$ is a win for Left.  The reason is because $0 &lt; \,\,\uparrow$, so 0 dominates $\uparrow$ for Right (we say that $\uparrow$ is a dominated option).  In <em>any</em> context, $G + X$, Right should never move to $\uparrow$ if 0 is available as an alternative, because $0 + X$ will always be better than $\uparrow + \,X$ for Right (in the sense that if Right wins the latter then Right also wins the former).</p>

<p>On the left side of $G$, the option $\uparrow$ is a <em>reversible option</em>.  I'll let you look up the details in ONAG (or Winning Ways), but the idea is as follows.  If Left moves to $\uparrow$, Right can follow with a move to $\ast$.  But $\ast &lt; \, G$ (because $G =\,\uparrow +\,\ast$ and $\uparrow\, &gt; 0$), which is saying that if Left moves to $\uparrow$, Right can immediately follow with a move to $\ast$ that leaves Left in a worse position than the original $G$.  This means that there is no reason for Left to move to $\uparrow$ unless he plans to continue following through after Right's response to $\ast$ (as opposed to playing in some other component $X$; remember that we are studying $G+X$ for any game $X$). But after Right's response to $\ast$, Left's only move is to 0.  </p>

<p>The upshot of the previous paragraph is that we can replace Left's option $\uparrow$ with a Left option directly to 0.</p>

<p>In summary, in $G$, we have deleted $\uparrow$ from the right side, and replaced $\uparrow$ with 0 on the left side, giving the simplified form $$\{\ast, 0 | 0 \}$$ as claimed by Conway.</p>

<p>Proof: For $n\in \mathbb N$ let $d_n=\frac {q-p}{n}$ and let $a_j=a+jd_n$ for $0\leq j\leq n.$ The graph of $f$ on the interval $[a_j,a_{j+1}]$ is covered by the rectangle  $[a_j,a_{j+1}]\times [f(a_j)-Kd_n,\;f(a_j)+Kd_n].$  This rectangle has area $2K(d_n)^2.$ There are $n$ such rectangles, so the content of the graph of $f$ on $[p,q]$ cannot exceed $$n\cdot 2K(d_n)^2 =2K(q-p)^2/n.$$ Since $n$ can be any natural number, the content of the graph of $f$ on $[p,q]$ is zero.</p>

<p>Let $A$ be a non-identity element of $SO(3)$.  Then $A$ has a 1-diml eigenspace (the axis of rotation), about which we rotate by an angle $\theta$.  This eigenspace intersects the unit sphere somewhere, so write this point of intersection as

<p>Your approach, while it does identify the fact that the 18 triangles are independent, fails to find the extra 1-cycle $ab+bc+ca$.  This is because the 18 triangles only can get $2(ab+bc+ca)$.  Over a field this would not be an issue, but $\mathbb{Z}$ does not have division by 2.

<p>If what you want is an explicit description of a basis of 1-cycles, here is a computational trick from graph theory: (1) take any spanning tree of the graph (2) count the number of edges outside the spanning tree. Each edge corresponds to an independent cycle by attaching the unique shortest path through the tree between the two endpoints. Spanning implies there is such a path (otherwise you can add that edge to make the tree bigger). In your example, the complement of a spanning tree has 19 edges. These span the 1-cycles because an arbitrary 1-cycle will be cut up by the spanning tree, and anything completely inside the tree is not a cycle or 0.</p>

"2395881","2396091","<p>They should have had a Kronecker $ \delta $; a Dirac delta makes no sense in that context since it is a sum over $ n$ and not an integral. Based on my skim on the next page, this does not seem to affect those results much.</p>

<p>The correct derivation is as follows. The first equation is
$$
{\cal N}_L=\frac{L!}{2 L} \sum_{(n_q)_{q \in \mathbb{N}}} \delta(\Sigma_q n_q, L)  \prod_q \frac{N_q!}{n_q! (N_q-n_q)!}\left(\frac{q^2}{Nc}\right)^{n_q}$$
where $ \delta(m,n) $ is the Kronecker delta:
$$
\delta(m,n) = \frac{1}{2 \pi } \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{ i x ( m - n) } dx
$$
Putting this into the formula gives
$$
{\cal N}_L=\frac{L!}{2 L} \frac{1}{2 \pi }  \sum_{(n_q)_{q \in \mathbb{N}}} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{ i x L - \sum_q i x n_q}  \prod_q \frac{N_q!}{n_q! (N_q-n_q)!}\left(\frac{q^2}{Nc}\right)^{n_q} dx \\ =\frac{L!}{2 L} \frac{1}{2 \pi }  \sum_{(n_q)_{q \in \mathbb{N}}} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{ i x L}  \prod_q \frac{N_q!}{n_q! (N_q-n_q)!}\left(\frac{q^2 e^{-i x}}{Nc}\right)^{n_q} dx \\ =\frac{L!}{2 L} \frac{1}{2 \pi } \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{ i x L}  \prod_q \left(1 - \left(\frac{q^2 e^{-i x}}{Nc}\right)\right)^{N_q} dx. $$
In the last line, I used the binomial theorem to do the sums over $ (n_q)_{q \in \mathbb{N} } $. Moving on, rewriting the product over $ q $ as a sum in the exponent,
$$
\frac{L!}{2 L} \frac{1}{2 \pi } \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{ i x L}  \exp \left( \sum_q \log \left(1 - \left(\frac{q^2 e^{-i x}}{Nc}\right)\right) N_q \right) dx
$$
and recognizing that $$ \frac{1}{N} \sum_q \log \left(1 - \left(\frac{q^2 e^{-i x}}{Nc}\right)\right) N_q = \left\langle \log \left(1 - \left(\frac{q^2 e^{-i x}}{Nc}\right)\right) \right\rangle$$
gives the final answer. </p>

"2395895","2396291","<p>There's a missing assumption $g\ge 0$; without it the statement is false since $u(x,t)\le g(x)$ for all $t\ge 0$. </p>

<p>An intuitive way to think of the minimum of $\frac{|x-y|^2}{4t} + g(y)$ is that it's the smallest number $C$ for which the equation $g(y) = C- \frac{|x-y|^2}{4t}$ has a solution. Well this is not quite intuitive yet, but think of the family $C- \frac{|x-y|^2}{4t}$ parameterized by $C$ as an upside-down paraboloid rising from $C=0$ until it meets the graph of $g$. Then the claim is: when  the paraboloid is very flat ($t$ is large),  it can't rise far before hitting the graph of $g$. Then the statement becomes obvious because $g$ decays at infinity: that far-away, low part of the graph of $g$ will get in the way of the rising paraboloid.</p>

<p>But ""it's obvious"" still isn't a proof, so let's fix $x$ and suppose $u(x,t) \ge \epsilon$ for some large $t$. Then $g(y)  + |x-y|^2/(4t) \ge \epsilon  $ for all $y$. Pick $y$ such that $g(y) \le \epsilon/2$ and conclude that 
$$
t\le \frac{|x-y|^2}{2\epsilon} \tag{1}
$$
So, for every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exist $t_0$ such that $u(x,t)&lt;\epsilon$ when $t&gt;t_0$. The very definition of $\lim_{t\to\infty}u(x,t) = 0$.</p>

<p>And the above can be made uniform with respect to $x$, using the assumption
$g(x)\le \frac{M}{|x|}$. Indeed, any $y$ with $|y|\ge 2M/\epsilon$ will do now, so  in (1) we can be assured to have $|x-y|\le 2M/\epsilon$ no matter what $x$ is, leading to<br>

"2395941","2395991","<p>If you think of a probability as the fraction of the time something happens, it is conceptually clear that the probability that two things happen must be no greater than the probability that either one of them happens individually.  So $\Pr[A\cap B]\le \Pr[A]$ and $\Pr[A\cap B]\le\Pr[B]$.</p>

<p>The question is, in what way does $\Pr[A\cap B]$ get reduced relative to $\Pr[A]$ or $\Pr[B]$?  Let's say $\Pr[A]=\frac{3}{5}$ and $\Pr[B]=\frac{2}{3}$, so that $A$ happens $\frac{3}{5}$ of the time and $B$ happens $\frac{2}{3}$ of the time.  If one didn't think about it carefully, one might think that $B$ happens on $\frac{2}{3}$ of those occasions when $A$ happens and therefore that $A\cap B$ happens $\frac{3}{5}\cdot\frac{2}{3}=\frac{2}{5}$ of the time, in just the same way as $\frac{2}{3}$ of $\frac{3}{5}$ of a cake is $\frac{2}{5}$ of a cake.   But that is, in fact, only true when $A$ and $B$ are independent.  It could well be the $B$ happens whenever $A$ happens, so that $\Pr[A\cap B]=\Pr[A]\cdot1=\Pr[A]$.  Or it could be that $B$ never happens when $A$ happens so that $\Pr[A\cap B]=\Pr[A]\cdot0=0$.  In fact, $\Pr[A\cap B]$ can take any value between $0$ and $\Pr[A]$ depending on whether the occurrence of $A$ makes $B$ less likely, leaves the probability of $B$ unchanged, or makes $B$ more likely.</p>

<p>Of course this discussion really hasn't got away from the conditional definition.  The general formula for $\Pr[A\cap B]$ is
$$
\Pr[A\cap B]=\Pr[A]\cdot\Pr[B\mid A].
$$
Independence is precisely the condition that the occurrence of $A$ makes $B$ neither more nor less likely, $\Pr[B\mid A]=\Pr[B]$, so that the formula becomes $\Pr[A\cap B]=\Pr[A]\cdot\Pr[B]$.

First, we note that if $A,B$ are any sets such that $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$, then $$\text{diam}(A)+\text{diam}(B) \geq \text{diam}(A \cup B)$$ Indeed, for any $x \in A$ and $y \in B$, we let $z \in A \cap B$ and we have that $$|x-y| \leq |x-z|+|z-y| \leq \text{diam}(A)+\text{diam}(B)$$ Now given our partition $\{A_k\}_{k=1}^N$, we assume wlog that $\overline A_k \cap \overline A_{k+1} \neq \emptyset$ for all $k&lt; N$ (this must hold after some reordering of the $A_i$, by the connectedness of $S_r$). Then by repeatedly applying the above observation (and using the fact that any set and its closure have the same diameter) we find \begin{align*}\text{diam}(S_r) &amp;\le \text{diam}(A_1)+ \text{diam} \bigg( \bigcup_{k=2}^N A_k \bigg) \\ &amp; \leq \text{diam}(A_1)+\text{diam}(A_2)+\text{diam}\bigg( \bigcup_{k=3}^N A_k \bigg) \\ &amp;\leq \text{diam}(A_1)+\text{diam}(A_2)+\text{diam}(A_3)+ \text{diam}\bigg( \bigcup_{k=4}^N A_k \bigg) \\ &amp;\dots \dots \dots \\ &amp;\leq \sum_{k=1}^N \text{diam}(A_k)

However, we can attack this with a more naive approach:</p>

<p>First, we know that the Galois group of a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_{\deg(f)}$, and when $f$ is irreducible, this subgroup is <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TransitiveGroup.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">transitive</a>$^\dagger$.  Therefore, the Galois group of any irreducible cubic polynomial must be either $S_3$ or $A_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}_3$.  If the cubic polynomial in question has complex roots, complex conjugation will be a nontrivial automorphism of the splitting field.  Since complex conjugation is an element of the Galois group of order $2$, we'll have $\text{Gal}(f) \cong S_3$ per <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_theorem_(group_theory)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lagrange's theorem</a>. </p>

<p>So for irreducible cubic polynomials, we know $\text{Complex roots} \implies S_3$ Galois group.  But what of cubics with all real roots?  Will we necessarily have $\text{Gal}(f) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3$?  Is $\text{Gal}(f) \cong S_3$ still possible?  At this point, I think the discriminant argument is the easiest way to proceed.  Some hints are below:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> It is always the case that $D \in \mathbb{Q}$, and anything in $\mathbb{Q}$ is fixed by elements of $\text{Gal}(f)$.  Next, consider the tower of fields $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D}) \subset \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D}, \alpha)$, where $\alpha$ is one of the roots of $f$.  Note that the latter field is the splitting field of $f$ (why?).  </p>

"
"2396057","2396074","<p>The Chinese remainder theorem does not apply here.  To apply the Chinese remainder theorem to the ideals $(a)$ and $(b)$, you would need to know that $(a)+(b)$ is the whole ring $R$, which may not be the case (consider $R=k[x,y]$, $a=x$, $b=y$).</p>

<p>In general, multiplication by $a$ will be injective on $R/(b)$ (since $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime) but not surjective.   So for even $i$, you will get that $Tor_i^{R/(ab)}(R/(a),R/(b))$ is the cokernel of multiplication by $a$ on $R/(b)$, which is $R/(a,b)$.</p>

"2396080","2396150","<p>So $v$ is a unit vector which is ""optimal"" in the sense that $\| Av \|_2$ is as large as possible.  Let $x$ be a vector that is orthogonal to $v$.  We want to show that $Ax$ is orthogonal to $Av$.</p>

<p><strong>If this were not the case, then $v$ would not be optimal, because we could <em>improve</em> $v$ by perturbing it a bit in the direction $x$!</strong></p>

<p>I'll explain the intuitive idea first. When we perturb $v$ in the direction $x$, the norm of $v$ does not change (at least to a very good approximation).  Imagine standing on the surface of the earth, and $v$ is the vector from the center of the earth to your current location.  If you take a step in a direction orthogonal to $v$, your distance from the center of the earth does not change. You are walking on the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>However, when $v$ is perturbed in the direction of $x$, the vector $Av$ is perturbed in the direction of $Ax$. And if $Av$ is not orthogonal to $Ax$, then the change in the value of $Av$ is <em>non-negligible</em>. So, by perturbing $v$ in the direction of $x$ (or perhaps opposite the direction of $x$), we obtain a unit vector $\tilde v$ for which $\| A \tilde v\|_2$ is larger than $\| Av \|_2$. This shows that $v$ is not optimal after all, which is a contradiction.</p>

<hr>

<p>That is the intuition, and it is simple and clear. It remains only to convert this intuition into a rigorous proof.</p>

<p>To get a rigorous proof, we will have to deal with the fact that $\tilde v = v + \epsilon x$ is not actually a unit vector, even though its norm is very close to $1$ when $\epsilon$ is tiny. So, we introduce the normalized vector
$$
\hat v(\epsilon) = \frac{v + \epsilon x}{\sqrt{1 + \epsilon^2}},
$$
which is a true unit vector. Let
$$
f(\epsilon) = \| A \hat v(\epsilon) \|_2^2.
$$
Because $v$ is optimal, we see that $f'(0) = 0$.  And if we compute $f'(0)$ explicitly (which is a straightforward calculus exercise), we will find that $\langle Av, Ax \rangle = 0$.
Here are the details:
\begin{align}  
f(\epsilon) &amp;= \frac{1}{(1 + \epsilon^2)} \langle Av + \epsilon Ax, Av + \epsilon Ax \rangle \\
&amp;= \left(\frac{1}{1 + \epsilon^2}\right) \| Av \|_2^2 + \left(\frac{\epsilon}{1 + \epsilon^2}\right) \langle Av, Ax \rangle + \left(\frac{\epsilon^2}{1 + \epsilon^2}\right) \| Ax \|_2^2.
\end{align}
Using basic calculus we see that
$$
f'(0) = \langle Av, Ax \rangle = 0.
$$</p>
"
"2396087","2396164","<p>Sure, here's a demonstration of that first inequality. We have
$$
\lambda_1 = \min \{x^*Ax : x = (x_1,x_2,x_3)^T \in \Bbb C^3, \|x\| = 1\}\\
\leq \min\left\{ x^*Ax : x = (x_1,x_2,x_3)^T \in \Bbb C^3, \|x\| = 1, x_3 = 0\right\}\\

"
"2396110","2396505","<p>It depends how you define ""impossible"". </p>

<p>Colloquially speaking, you could define it to mean if the chance is less than some tiny $\epsilon$, then it is ""impossible"". 
Then you could solve for the number of picks that would satisfy that.
Most people would probably be unsatisfied with that though. (Even if $\epsilon=10^{-1000}$ the event <em>could</em> still technically happen)</p>

<p>In stricter sense of the word, one might ask for the probability to be $0$. 
This is not miniscule; it means literally zero.
In this case, the number of picks would have to go to infinity; in the situation described, this will <em>never</em> happen, because there will always be a non-zero chance of picking a string of one color, no matter how long that string is. No matter how small $0.99^n$ is (or how large $n$ is), the probability is positive.</p>

<p>In fact, for me personally, even zero probability is not strong enough for me to call an event ""impossible"". For instance, consider choosing a real number $c\in\mathbb{R}$ uniformly in the interval $[7,13]$. What is the probability of choosing <em>exactly</em> $c=9.713$? It is <strong>zero</strong>. But is it <em>possible</em>? Yes. It is a number inside the interval. To me, therefore, it is not <em>impossible</em>.

<p>Anyway, I don't think finding a retract (which also lets you write down an explicit extension in the definition of a cofibration) is ""simpler"" than your method, but here's how.  </p>

<p>We need to show that $$(X \times I \times \{0\}) \cup_{X \times \{0\} \times \{0\}} (X \times \{0\} \times I) \subset X \times I \times I$$ is a retract.

<p>By the primitive element theorem $K=\Bbb{Q}(\alpha)$ for some $\alpha\in K$. The minimal polynomial $m(x)$ of $\alpha$ is then necessarily a cubic. But, as $K/\Bbb{Q}$ is normal, all the zeros of $m(x)$ are in $K$.</p>

<hr>

<p>Extras for the question about an arbitrary polynomial $f(x)$ with splitting field $K$. Consider a non-linear irreducible factor of $f(x)$. It cannot be a quadratic for then $[K:\Bbb{Q}]$ would be even. It cannot be $\ge4$ for then $[K:\Bbb{Q}]$ would also be $\ge4$. Ergo, that irreducible factor must be cubic.</p>
"
"2396160","2396479","<p>(1) Yes, you could think of it as knowing $X_0$ gives no new information about $X_{n+m}$ if $X_n$ is known. By the Markov property, one could say that, <em>conditioned on the present</em>, the future does not depend on the past.</p>

<p>(2) I think this is because you are assuming that the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Variations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Markov process is stationary</a> (i.e. it is time-homogeneous), which means the state-to-state transition probabilities do not change over time. It does also relate to the Markov property as well of course. In this case:
$$ P(X_{n+m}=j\,|\,X_n=k) = P(X_{n+m+s}=j\,|\,X_{n+s}=k) $$
In words, going from state $k$ to state $j$ in $m$ steps is always the same. Hence, set $s=-n$ to get:
$$ P(X_{n+m}=j\,|\,X_n=k) = P(X_{m}=j\,|\,X_{0}=k) $$
In essence, only the time <em>difference</em> matters. Hence, translation of <em>both</em> indices in time does not change the value.</p>

<p>With regards to your question, I would not say that it is irregardless of the current state; rather, it is because the process acts the same once it reaches a given state, no matter how it got there. Hence, going from $s_1$ to $s_2$ in $t$ steps is always the same; it doesn't matter if you arrived at $s_1$ at time $0$ or at time $n$ (due to stationarity), as the chance of reaching $s_2$ in $t$ steps remains the same.</p>

"2396180","2396198","<p>First of all I applaud you for the username.</p>

<p>I'll do an induction proof for you, and show you why I do everything. Hopefully this will answer all your questions.</p>

<p>Suppose we have the following:</p>

<p>$$
f(n) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
        n, &amp; \text{for } 0\leq n\leq 2\\
        3f(n-2)+2f(n-3), &amp; \text{for } n&gt;2\\
        \end{array}\right\}
$$</p>

<p>Let's prove $f(n)&lt;2^n$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$</p>

<p>Let's define a predicate.</p>

<p>For all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, let $P(n):f(n)&lt;2^n$</p>

<p>Pf of $\forall n, P(n)$.</p>

<hr>

<p>Base case(s)</p>

<p>First of all, notice the when we recurse ($n&gt;2$), we have to ""go back"" at most $3$ numbers, hence the $n-3$. This should suggest that we have $3$ base cases.</p>

<p>As for which ones, well definitely we must prove $P(0)$, and after that, we prove 2 more, so we prove $P(1),P(2)$. So in the inductive step, when we ""go back"", we have these base cases to work with, so we are okay. If you only proved $P(0)$, then in the inductive step you would get stuck, because you don't know anything regarding $P(n-2)$.</p>

<p>Let $n=0$</p>

<p>Then $f(n)=0$, by definition</p>

<p>$&lt; 2^0 = 1$</p>

<p>$\therefore P(0)$ holds.</p>

<p>Now do $P(1)$ and $P(2)$</p>

<hr>

<p>Induction Step:
For of all, since we proved $P(0-2)$, now we let $n&gt;2$, or equally $n\geq 3$, so we enter the induction step.</p>

<p>Let $n&gt;2$</p>

<p>Suppose $P(j)$ holds where $0\leq j\leq n-1, j\in\mathbb{N}$. [IH]</p>

<p>What does this say? This says let $j$ be an arbitrary natural number between $0$ and $n-1$, both inclusive. This says that suppose $P(0)\land P(1)\land\dots\land P(n-1)$ hold. This is how I write my IH, it's very clear. Moreover, you can also write this:</p>

<p>Suppose $P(j)$ holds where $0\leq j\lt n, j\in\mathbb{N}$. [IH]</p>

<p>We want to prove that $P(n)$ holds. It's much easier to prove $P(n)$ holds, rather then assuming $P(n)$ and proving $P(n+1)$.</p>

<p>$f(n)=3f(n-2)+2f(n-3)$, by definition of recursive step</p>

<p>$&lt;3\cdot 2^{n-2}+2\cdot 2^{n-3}$, by IH, since $0\leq n-3&lt;n-2&lt;n$</p>

<p>$=6\cdot 2^{n-3}+2\cdot 2^{n-3}$</p>

<p>$=8\cdot 2^{n-3}$</p>

<p>$=2^n$</p>

<p>$\therefore P(n)$ holds.</p>

<hr>

<p>We have showed it holds for all $\mathbb{N}$, and so our proof is done. For proving how many base cases, think about how many steps the recursion ""goes back"", and proceed from there. For writing your induction hypothesis, it becomes much easier with a predicate and proving $P(n)$. If you can understand the way I wrote mine, just use that. Assume the predicate holds within that range, where $0$ is your first base case, and $n-1$ is what you assume it holds to. Then prove $P(n)$. Hope you found this answer useful.</p>
"
"2396184","2396213","<p>The notation you are using is a bit off. For example $\in$ is the symbol indicating that an element belongs to a set, so saying things like</p>

and<br>
$$\{w_1,w_2,...,w_q\}\in \{kv_1 + kv_2 + ...kv_r\}$$ </p>

<p>For the proof itself, the ""only if"" direction (that is, if $\mathrm{span}\{v_1,\ldots,v_r\}=\mathrm{span}\{w_1,\ldots,w_q\}$, then you have the statement about linear combinations) follows from the definition of span. Can you see why?</p>

<p>As for the other direction, what you need to show is that if each $v_i$ is a linear combination of the $w_j$, then $\mathrm{span}\{v_1,\ldots,v_r\}\subset \mathrm{span}\{w_1,\ldots,w_q\}$. Likewise, if each $w_j$ is a linear combination of the $v_i$, then $\mathrm{span}\{v_1,\ldots,v_r\}\supset \mathrm{span}\{w_1,\ldots,w_q\}$. I'll prove one and leave the rest to you.</p>

<p>Since $v_i$ is a linear combination of the $w_j$, by definition we have $v_i\in \mathrm{span}\{w_1,\ldots,w_q\}$, for each $i=1,\ldots,r$. Since $\mathrm{span}\{w_1,\ldots,w_q\}$ is a vector space, it is closed under taking sums of vectors and scalar multiplication, so we are free to take linear combinations of elements inside $\mathrm{span}\{w_1,\ldots,w_q\}$.</p>

<p>In particular, we can take ANY linear combinations of $S=\{v_1,\ldots, v_r\}$, and it will still lie in $\mathrm{span}\{w_1,\ldots,w_q\}$. Thus, by defintion 
$$\mathrm{span}\{v_1,\ldots,v_r\}\subset \mathrm{span}\{w_1,\ldots,w_q\}.$$</p>

<p>This proves one direction. I leave showing $\mathrm{span}\{v_1,\ldots,v_r\}\supset \mathrm{span}\{w_1,\ldots,w_q\}$, and the ""only if"" direction to you. I hope this helps.</p>

"2396199","2396233","<p>It shouldn't be too bad. I will focus on the case where the elements (vectors) in the last column have a different dimension than the elements in the first $m-1$ columns.... So, Assume you are given an $n\times m$ matrix where the (vectors) of the first $m-1$ columns have $k_1$ elements, and the vectors in the last column each have $k_2$ elements. If we count the elements in each vector for each vector in some particular row (say row $i$), we get</p>

<p>$\sum _{j=1} ^{m} |A_{ij}|$<br>
 $=$  $\sum _{j=1} ^{m-1} |A_{ij}|+ \sum _{j=m-1} ^{m} |A_{ij}|$</p>

<p>Each term in the sum on left has value $k_1$ and the single term in the sum on the right (the size of the vector in the last column) is $k_2$</p>

<p>Thus we have $(m-1 \cdot k_1 )$$+k_2$ elements in each row. Call this quantity $Q$</p>

<p>Since there are $n$ rows, you have exactly $n\cdot Q$ elements total. </p>

<p>Now, given $l$ (some id of an element as you described) you can first determine the row by computing $\lfloor \frac{l}{Q} \rfloor$ (floor function). Call this value $V$</p>

<p>The same idea applies to finding the column. Once you know your row, you are essentially ""starting from 0"" when counting over columns, so to figure out how many elements into the given row $l$ is, compute
$l - V\cdot Q$ (or use the mod function and take $l$ mod $Q$).</p>

<p>The quantity $l - V\cdot Q$ tells you the number of elements you need to count over in the given row in order to find your element. I would break this into two cases, </p>

<p>case 1) If  $l - V\cdot Q \geq (m-1)\cdot k$ then you know you are in the last column and it should be smooth sailing from there.</p>

<p>case 2) o.w. $l - V\cdot Q &lt; (m-1)\cdot k$
to determine the column just compute:
$col$=$\lfloor (l - V\cdot Q )/ k \rfloor$</p>

<p>Last, the element number in the vector is given by the remainder of (l - V\cdot Q )/ k, i.e.$elt_in_vector=(l - V\cdot Q )/ \mod k$</p>

"2396226","2396240","<p>In general $$\int_{0}^{2\pi} f(\theta)\,d\theta$$ is not the area of the curve, even when $f(\theta)&gt;0$ for all $\theta$. This is because for $\Delta\theta$, the area is estimated by a triangle, not a rectangle. In particular, you have a triangle with lengths $f(\theta),f(\theta+\Delta \theta)$ and angle $\Delta\theta$. The triangle area is thus 
$$\frac{1}{2}f(\theta)f(\theta+\Delta\theta)\sin \Delta\theta.$$</p>

<p>Turns out, $\sin\Delta x\sim \Delta x$ is good enough. Thus, to get the area bounded by $f(\theta)$, you want:</p>

"2396307","2397027","<p>The question is about the sum of a $5$-subset of $\{1,2,\dots,80\}$, taken modulo $10$. </p>

<p>Yes, there are some tricky ways to enumerate those. </p>

<p>Denote $\varepsilon_k = e^{\pi k i/5}$, $k=1,\dots,9$, $10$th roots of unity. Then 
$$\tag{1}
\sum_{k=0}^9 \varepsilon_k^n = \begin{cases}
10, &amp; 10\mid n,\\
0, &amp; 10\nmid n.

$$</p>

<p>Note that 
$$
F(u,z) = \prod_{j = 1}^{80} (1+ u z^j) = \sum_{j,n} A(j,n) u^j z^n,
$$
where $A(j,n)$ is the number of $j$-subsets with sum $n$. 
Therefore, the number of $5$-subsets with sum equal to $0$ modulo $10$ is equal, thanks to $(1)$, to 
$$
[u^5]\frac{1}{10}\sum_{k=0}^9 F(u,\varepsilon_k),
$$
(the coefficient before $u^5$). </p>

<p>If $\varepsilon_k$ is a primitive root (i.e. $k=1,3,7,9$), then (noting that $\varepsilon^{10}_k = 1$)
$$
F(u,\varepsilon_k) = \Big(\prod_{n=0}^{9}(1+u \varepsilon_k^{n})\Big)^{8} = \big(1 - (-u)^{10}\big)^{8} = (1-u^{10})^8,
$$
since $\varepsilon_k^n$, $n=0,\dots,9$, are different $10$th roots of unity.</p>

<p>If $k=2,4,6,8$, then $\varepsilon_k$ is a primitive $5$th root of unity, so, similarly,
$$
F(u,\varepsilon_k) = \big(1 - (-u)^{5}\big)^{16} = (1+u^5)^{16}.
$$
Further,
$$
F(u,\varepsilon_5) = \big(1-(-u)^2\big)^{40} = (1-u^2)^{40}.
$$
Finally,
$$
F(u,\varepsilon_0) = F(u,1) (1+u)^{80}.
$$</p>

<p>Therefore, the number of $5$-subsets with sum divisible by $10$ is
$$
[u^5]\frac{1}{10}\big( 4(1-u^{10})^8 + 4(1+u^5)^{16} + (1-u^2)^{40} + (1+u)^{80} \big)\\
 = \frac25 {16 \choose 1} + \frac1{10}{80\choose 5} = 2\,404\,008.
$$</p>

<p>The number of $4$-subsets:
$$
[u^4]\frac{1}{10}\big( 4(1-u^{10})^8 + 4(1+u^5)^{16} + (1-u^2)^{40} + (1+u)^{80} \big)\\

<p>For instance, consider the additive group $\mathbb{G}_a=\mathbb{A}^1$ over $\mathbb{R}$.

\underset{x,y}{\text{minimize}}\ \quad \quad x^2+3y^2-y\\

$$
To put it in Lagrangian form, we simply restate the problem as
$$
L(x,y,\lambda) = x^2+3y^2-y + \lambda(x^2+2y^2-2)

What we need to do now is to find all the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush%E2%80%93Kuhn%E2%80%93Tucker_conditions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">KKT points</a>. To do so, we solve the following problem

\frac{\partial L}{\partial y}=0 \iff 6y-1+4\lambda y=0\quad (2)\\
\lambda(x^2+2y^2-2)=0 \quad (3)
$$
First, assume that $\lambda=0$, then we must have (from $(1)$ and $(2)$) $x=0,y=1/6$. This is our first KKT-point. To find the others, assume that $\lambda\neq 0$. Then from $(1)$ we get either $x=0$ or $\lambda=-1$ from $(2)$. This yields the points $(x,y)=(0,1)$, $(x,y)=(0,-1)$, and $(x,y) = (\frac{\pm\sqrt(3)}{2},\frac{1}{2})$. Now lets check which point is minimium/maximum:
$$
f(0,1/6) = -\frac{1}{12}\\
f(0,1) = 2\\
f(0,-1) = 4\\
f(\frac{\sqrt(3)}{2},\frac{1}{2})=1\\
f(\frac{-\sqrt(3)}{2},\frac{1}{2})=1
$$
Thus the minimum is $-\frac{1}{12}$ attained at $(x,y) = (0,\frac{1}{6})$ and the maximum is $4$ attained at $(x,y) = (0,-1)$.</p>

The three points $e^{2i\alpha}$, $e^{2i\beta}$, $e^{2i\gamma}$ therefore again form an equilateral triangle on $S^1$, so that the stated claim holds true.</p>

$$\begin{cases} v_1'y_1+v_2'y_2=0 \\ v_1' y_1'+v_2' y_2'=f(x) \end{cases}$$
Where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are the two fundamental solutions to $y''+p(x)y'+q(x)y=0$. Hence, in your case, we have:
$$\begin{cases} v_1'\cdot x+v_2'\cdot \frac{1}{x}=0 \\ v_1'-v_2'\cdot \frac{1}{x^2}=\frac{1}{2+x} \end{cases}$$
Solving the above system by elimination, we see that the problem boils down to evaluating the following 2 integrals:
$$v_1=\int \frac{1}{2(x+2)}~dx\tag{1.1}$$
$$v_2=-\int \frac{x^2}{2(x+2)}~dx \tag{1.2}$$
Recall that Variation of Parameters assumes that the particular solution will be given in the form of $(2)$, therefore all you need to do is substitute the results from $(1.1)$ and $(1.2)$ you obtain.

"
"2396582","2396658","<p>For a rigorous proof lets recast our problem a bit. Assume $f:[-1,1]\to \Bbb R$ is differentiable, $f(0)=0$ but for $x&gt;0$ you have $f(x)&gt;0$. We want to show that there is a contradiction if there exists a continuous $g:\Bbb R\to \Bbb R$ so that $f'(x)=f(x)g(f(x)+x)$. If you want I can explain how solving this problem is the same as solving the above one.</p>

<p>Since $f(0)=0$ we can find a differentiable $h$ so that $f(x)=xh(x)$ (this is sometimes called the Morse Lemma, specifically $h(x)=\int_0^1 f'(tx)\,dt$). It follows that
$$f'(x)=h(x)+xh'(x)\overset!= f(x)g(f(x)+x)=xh(x)g(x(h(x)+1))$$
for $x&gt;0$ divide by $xh(x)$ (because $f$ is non-zero here, so too must $h$) to get:
$$g(x h(x)+x)=\frac1x+\frac{h'(x)}{h(x)}\qquad\text{whenever }x&gt;0$$
Now taking the limit $x\to0^+$ gives $g(0)$ on the left, so it should also do so on the right. First note that $\frac{h'(x)}{h(x)}=\partial_x\ln(h(x))$ and if the term on the right is to have a limit you must have that
$$\partial_x \ln(h(x)) = -\frac1x + c(x)$$
where $C(x)$ is some continuous function. So
$$\ln(h(x)) = \ln(1/x) + C(x)$$
where $C(x)$ is a continuous anti-derivative of $c$. It follows by taking exponentials (remember $h(x)$ is positive) that
$$h(x)=\frac{e^{C(x)}}x$$
for $x&gt;0$. This is a contradiction to $h(x)$ being <em>continuous</em> at $0$, let alone differentiable.</p>

"2396587","2397455","<p>As is often the case with ""at least one"" events, it seems easier to work with the events' complements.  We use a generating function approach, with a computer algebra system to ease the computations.</p>

<p>$A^c$ is the event that all the rows contain at least one zero.  The generating function for the number of ways to place $r$ zeroes in a 16 by 3 matrix with at least one zero in each row is
$$f(x) = \left( \binom{3}{1} x + \binom{3}{2} x^2 + \binom{3}{3}x^3 \right)^{16}$$
The coefficient of $x^{24}$, which is the number of ways to place $24$ zeroes in the matrix with at leaast one zero in each row, is
$[x^{24}]f = 2,348,209,259,370$,
so 
$$\Pr(B^c) =\Pr(A^c) = [x^{24}]f \; / \; \binom{48}{24} \approx 0.0728181$$
and
$$\Pr(B) = \Pr(A) \approx \boxed{0.927182}$$</p>

<p>Continuing, $A^c \cap B^c$ is the event that each row contains at least one zero and at least one one, or equivalently, each row contains one or two zeroes.  This time the generating function is
$$g(x) = \left( \binom{3}{1} x + \binom{3}{2} x^2 \right)^{16}$$
and the coefficient of $x^{24}$, which is the number of ways to place $24$ zeroes in the matrix with one or two zeroes in each row, is $[x^{24}]g = 554,011,299,270$, so
$$\Pr(A^c \cap B^c) = [x^{24}]g \; / \;\binom{48}{24} \approx 0.0171799$$
Therefore
$$\begin{align}
\Pr(A \cap B) &amp;= 1-\Pr((A \cap B)^c) \\
&amp;= 1 - \Pr(A^c \cup B^c) \\
&amp;= 1-[\Pr(A^c) + \Pr(B^c) - \Pr(A^c \cap B^c)] \\

"
"2396589","2397558","<p>An interesting question in game theory would be the ever-elusive definition of what it means for an agent/person/player to be 'rational.'  </p>

<p>To motivate, imagine a world with one person in it, trying to do his or her best in the face of outside forces.  Within such a context, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the person either knows the true probabilities with which events may happen, or at the least has some subjective beliefs about this.  In such a world then, given these beliefs about what events they are facing, it makes sense to deem a person rational if they act in such a way as to maximize their expected utility (where the expectation is taken with regard to their beliefs/the true probabilities over events).  </p>

<p>Consider now game theory, where multiple (even just two) equally clever people are matched up against each other.  Even in the simplest possible context when the payoffs/structure of the game and the rationality of both players is common knowledge (either formally or informally construed), what it means to be rational is much more difficult and elusive thing, and indeed arguments over its definition have at least implicitly been the driving force behind the small cottage industry of refinements to the basic Nash equilibrium.</p>

<p>If you already have a background in basic game theory, depending upon your mathematical level you might find it interesting to discuss the various motivations for Nash equilibrium versus sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium, and perhaps, depending upon your mathematical background, things such as trembling-hand perfect equilibrium or sequential equilibrium.</p>

\sup |\sigma(T)| = \|T\|

Therefore you get the inequality you need. Since from $$\|T\| \in \sigma(T)\subseteq \overline{N(T)}$$
we conclude

<p>For you further question in the comments:
There is a theorem which says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem</strong> If $\mathcal{A}$ is a unital Banach-algebra and $A\in\mathcal{A}$ then $\sigma(A) \neq \emptyset$ and \begin{align}
 \sup_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)} |\lambda| = \max_{\lambda \in \sigma(A)}
 |\lambda| = \lim_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \|A^n\|^{\frac{1}{n}} =
 \inf_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \|A^n\|^{\frac{1}{n}}. \end{align}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found only a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_radius#Bounded_Linear_Operators"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia reference</a> so far. I will also use $\|TT^*\| = \|T\|^2$.
However using these two facts and the fact that $T^2$ is also normal
$$
\|T^2\|^2 = \|(T^2)^*(T^2)\| = \|(T^*T)^2\| = \|(T^*T)^* (T^* T)\| = \|T^*T\|^2 = (\|T\|^2)^2
$$
By induction $\|T^{2^k}\|= \|T\|^{2^k}$ therefore
$$
\sup_{\lambda \in \sigma(T)} |\lambda|= \lim_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \|T^n\|^{\frac{1}{n}}
= \lim_{k\in\mathbb{N}} \|T^{2^k}\|^{\frac{1}{2^k}} = \|T\|

"2396907","2396915","<p>Any vector in the reflection plane will be mapped into itself, so the eigenvalue will be 1.  Such vectors span a space of dimension 2, so, yes, there are your two eigenvalues of 1.  Any vector lying on the line perpendicular to the plane and passing through the origin will be mapped into its own negative, so there is your eigenvalue of -1.  And, modulo an overall scaling factor, there is only one such vector, so there will be only one eigenvalue of -1.  So I think you are right.</p>

<p>You can find the type of base you are looking for by rotating your coordinates so that $z$ is normal to the reflection plane.  You can rotate your coordinates around that axis any way you like and you will get the diagonal matrix you are looking for.</p>

<p>One procedure for getting that rotation would be to first take the gradient of your expression</p>

<p>$\nabla(ax+by+cz) = a\hat{x}+b\hat{y}+c\hat{z}$</p>

<p>The gradient is always normal to the function, so you know that you have here the normal to the plane.  So take the vector $(a,b,c)$ and normalize it, and you have the vector normal to the plane.  Now, at this point, you just need any two other vectors that are normal to each other and also normal to this vector.  One way to get one would be to take this new vector, call it $\hat{w}$, and cross it with $\hat{x}$, $\hat{w}\times\hat{x}$ and normalize that to get a vector $\hat{v}$.  Then take $\hat{v}\times\hat{w}$ to get $\hat{u}$.  Your new basis is $\hat{u}, \hat{v}, \hat{w}$.  But you have to be prepared for the exception when $\hat{w}\times\hat{x} = 0$.</p>

<p>After you have your new vectors, you have to calculate 9 dot products to get the transformation matrix you need.  If you have a vector in $\hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{z}$ coordinates, say $(q,r,s)$, you transform it to the $\hat{u}, \hat{v}, \hat{w}$ basis by multiplying by</p>

Now $\log(\cdot)$ is everywhere increasing so it is sufficient to show that $h(\gamma)$ is everywhere monotonic decreasing. We have

"
"2397051","2397427","<p>I will try to answer this question as I understand it, based on a quick scan
of parts of the article linked in your Comment.</p>

<p>'Discretization' or 'discrete approximation' of a continuous distribution
means (a) to divide the possible continuous values into non-overlapping intervals
( or 'bins') that cover the entire span of the observed data and then (b) to assign increasing numerical values (often integers) to bins of increasing continuous values. </p>

<p>'Equal areas' means that the bins contain (about) the same numbers of
subjects so that corresponding population bins are of (about) equal probability.
Then the integers that correspond to the bins are (about) equally likely.
It seems the rationale for wanting equal probabilities is to simplify simulations, because the integers representing the bins can be sampled
strictly at random.</p>

<p>The answer to your question is that means and standard deviations can be
approximately preserved if the discretization is done with care. Some information is lost when continuous values are
reduced to bins (and then integer values), so the preservation cannot be
exact. In general, the greater the number of bins, the greater the accuracy.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the population of some test scores is distributed $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu = 100,\,\sigma = 15), $ 
 and you have $n = 10\,000$ observations from that distribution.
Then you could pick cutpoints between ten bins roughly to match the deciles
of the sample. Here is a specific example with data simulated using
R statistical software:</p>

<pre><code>set.seed(1234); n = 10000  
x = rnorm(n, 100, 15)
mean(x);  sd(x)
## 100.0917       # exact sample mean
## 14.81294       # exact sample SD

q = quantile(x, (0:10)/10); q
       0%       10%       20%       30%       40%       50% 
 49.05905  81.07926  87.44960  92.54443  96.54166 100.06952 
      60%       70%       80%       90%      100% 
103.80729 107.79283 112.57182 118.96523 154.27160 
</code></pre>

<p>So that the bins are roughly $[49.06, 81.08), [81.08, 87.49), \dots
[112,57, 118.97), (118.97, 154,28].$ </p>

<p>For comparison, here is a plot of the population density of $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu = 100,\,\sigma = 15),$
with vertical lines at <em>population</em> deciles. The lines divide the area under the
curve into ten equal parts (although, due to an optical illusion the outer
areas may look larger at first, or even second, glance).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uQr7k.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uQr7k.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Notice that the sample mean and SD of the 10,000 (""continuous"") observed values are not far from the population mean
and SD, respectively.</p>

<p>We can use the <code>hist</code> function in R to get the corresponding interval
midpoints (rounded to integers) and frequencies.</p>

<pre><code>hist.stats = hist(x, br=q, plot=F)
f = hist.stats$counts
m = round(hist.stats$mids)
f; m
## 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000  # frequencies
## 65   84   90   95   98  102  106  110  116  137    # midpoints
</code></pre>

<p>Thus we have completed the 'equal areas discretization', where the integers
that represent the bins are their rounded midpoints.</p>

<p>Now the sample mean $A = \bar X$ and standard deviation $S$ can be
approximated as $100.3$ and $18.4,$ respectively, using the formulas</p>

<p>$$\bar X \approx \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{10} f_jm_j}{n}\;\;\text{and}\;\;\;
S \approx \sqrt{\frac{\sum_j f_j(m_j - \bar X)^2}{n-1}}.$$</p>

<pre><code>a = sum(f*m)/n;  s = sqrt(sum(f*(m-a)^2)/(n-1))
a;  s
## 100.3         # aprx 'discretized' sample mean
## 18.36964      # aprx 'discretized' sample SD
</code></pre>

<p>For many purposes these would be useful approximations of $\bar X$ and $S$
and thus useful estimates of the population $\mu$ and $\sigma.$</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Without the 'equal area' restriction, this method was used before the
computer age to simplify computations of sample means and SDs. 
Traditionally, it is the bin <em>widths</em> that are made equal, not the
bin <em>frequencies</em>. Nowadays, the histogram procedures in most statistical
software make histogram bins of equal widths by default. </p>

<p>The same formulas as above
(involving bin frequencies and midpoints) can be used to approximate
$\bar X$ and $S.$  In general, I suppose the method of equal widths
gives somewhat better approximations of $\bar X$ and $S.$ Below is a
histogram of the simulated $X_i$s above, with frequency labels atop
histogram bars.</p>

<p>The positions of the husbands and wives do not need to alternate since the wives may sit in adjacent seats.  For instance, the seating arrangement $H_1W_1H_2W_2W_3H_3$ is permissible since no two of the husbands sit in adjacent seats.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A group of $6$ people consisting of $3$ married couples are to be seated together in a straight row. How many different ways are there of seating the $6$ people if no husband is to sit next to another husband?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Method 1:</strong>  We arrange the wives, then insert the husbands among the wives.</p>

<p>Arrange the husbands in some order, say alphabetically, then hand each of them a chair.</p>

<p>Lay out three chairs for the wives.  The wives can arrange themselves in those chairs in $3!$ ways.  For each such arrangement arrangement, there are four spaces in which we can place the husbands, two between successive wives and two at the ends of the row.
$$\square W_1 \square W_2 \square W_3 \square$$
To ensure that the husbands do not sit in adjacent positions, they must choose three of these four spaces.  The first husband has four choices where to place his chair, the second has three, and the third has two.  Hence, the number of permissible seating arrangements is 
$$3! \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 3!4!$$ </p>

<p><strong>Method 2:</strong>  We use the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Inclusion-Exclusion+Principle&amp;title=Special%3ASearch&amp;fulltext=Search"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Inclusion-Exclusion Principle</a>.</p>

<p>The six people can be arranged in $6!$ ways.  From these, we must exclude those arrangements in which two husbands sit in adjacent seats.</p>

<p>A pair of husbands sit in adjacent seats:  There are $\binom{3}{2}$ ways to choose a pair of husbands who sit in adjacent seats.  This gives us five objects to arrange, the block consisting of the pair of husbands and the other four people.  The objects can be arranged in $5!$ orders.  Within the block, the two husbands can be arranged in $2!$ orders.  Hence, there are 
$$\binom{3}{2}5!2!$$
arrangements in which two husbands sit in adjacent seats.</p>

<p>However, 
$$6! - \binom{3}{2}5!2! = 0$$
Clearly, we have subtracted too much since the seating arrangement stated above shows it is possible to seat the three couples so that no two husbands sit in adjacent seats.</p>

<p>The reason we have subtracted too much is that we have subtracted those cases in which all three husbands sit together twice, once when we counted the leftmost and middle husband as our designated pair and once when we counted the rightmost and middle husband as our designated pair.  We only want to subtract them once, so we need to add those cases to the total.</p>

<p>Two pairs of adjacent husbands:  This can only occur if all three husbands sit in a block.  This gives us four objects to arrange, the block of three husbands and the three wives.  The four objects can be arranged in $4!$ ways.  Within the block, the husbands can be arranged in $3!$ ways.  Hence, there are 
$$4!3!$$
seating arrangements with two pairs of adjacent husbands.</p>

<p>Total:  By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of permissible seating arrangements is

"2397249","2397477","<p>A lot of algebraic geometry is developed by analogy with differential geometry.</p>

<p>In differential geometry, we speak of <em>manifolds</em> rather than varieties. The main feature of the definition of a manifold is that it is covered by <em>coordinate charts</em>: open sets $U$ together with a (smooth) homeomorphism $x : U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ (or alternatively, to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$).  The individual components of $x$ are called coordinates.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the pair of functions $(x,y)$ defined on the Euclidean plane after choosing coordinate axes.</p>

<hr>

<p>The situation here is not too different. On $\mathbb{A}^n_K$, affine $n$-space over a field $K$, the standard 'coordinate chart' has coordinates given by the $n$ variables. Since we're doing algebra, the 'functions' we can make out of these are polynomials.</p>

<p>The term ""coordinate function"" here refers to a function we can build out of coordinates &mdash; much like the ring of smooth continuous real-valued functions on a manifold. The coordinate ring is the ring of all such functions. (although, I don't think the phrase ""coordinate function"" tends to be used this way in differential geometry)</p>

<p>For subvarieties $V \subseteq \mathbb{A}^n_K$, we understand coordinate functions to be restrictions of coordinate functions on $\mathbb{A}^n_K$, thus we use the quotient ring of the coordinate ring of $\mathbb{A}^n_K$.</p>

<p>Furthermore, since every element of $K[V]$ can be viewed as the image of $t$ under a unique $K$-homomorphism $K[t] \to K[V]$, we can actually identify coordinate functions on $V$ with algebraic maps $V \to \mathbb{A}^1_K$.</p>

$$\oint_C\left(M~dx+N~dy\right)$$

"2397263","2397357","<p>Your middle morphism ($k_\star$) is not quite right. The correct morphisms are:
$$ 0 \to H_1(S^1) \to \mathbb Z \oplus \mathbb Z \overset{\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b\end{bmatrix} \mapsto \begin{bmatrix} a + b \\ - a - b\end{bmatrix}}\longrightarrow \mathbb Z \oplus \mathbb Z \overset{\begin{bmatrix} c \\ d\end{bmatrix} \mapsto c + d}{\longrightarrow}\mathbb Z \to 0$$
So the kernel of $k_\star$ has a single generator, namely, $(1,-1)$, hence $H_1(S^1) \cong \mathbb Z$.</p>

<p>But how can we be sure that $k_\star$ is as I've written it? I'll explain...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Suppose $U$ and $V$ are your two open arcs covering your $S^1$, i.e. $U$ and $V$ are your two $B^1$'s. Then $U \cap V$ has two path-connected components, so $$H_0(U \cap V) \cong \mathbb Z \oplus \mathbb Z,$$ as you correctly identified. (You're also right to observe that $U \cap V$ is homotopy-equivalent to $S^0$.) Anyway, the generator $(1,0) \in H_0(U \cap V) $ is the homology class of any point in the first  connected component of $U \cap V$, and the generator $(0,1) \in H_0(U \cap V) $ is the homology class of any point in the second connected component.</p></li>
<li><p>$U$ has a single path-component, so we simply have $$H_0(U) \cong \mathbb Z.$$ We'll denote the generator of $H_0(U)$ as $1 \in \mathbb Z$. This generator is the homology class of any point in $U$.</p></li>
<li><p>Under the inclusion map $U \cap V \hookrightarrow U$, a point in the first path-component of $U \cap V$ simply becomes a point in $U$. A point in the second path-component of $U \cap V$ also becomes a point in $U$. Therefore, the inclusion map $U \cap V \hookrightarrow U$ includes the map
$$ H_0(U \cap V) \to H_0(U)$$
given by
$$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \mapsto 1, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} \mapsto 1..$$</p></li>
<li><p>The same remarks apply to $V$: the inclusion map $U \cap V \hookrightarrow V$, includes the map
$$ H_0(U \cap V) \to H_0(V)$$
given by
$$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \mapsto 1, \ \ \ \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} \mapsto 1.$$</p></li>
<li><p>By the definition in your textbook, the map $$k_\star : H_0(U \cap V) \to H_0(U) \oplus H_0(V)$$ is obtained by taking the direct sum of the two inclusion-induced maps that I described above in the previous two bullet points. There is one caveat, which is that we must insert a minus sign into the action of the second map (the one involving $H_0(V)$); this extra minus sign is a part of how $k_\star$ is defined in the textbook. So the action of $k_\star$ on our generators is:
$$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \mapsto \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ - 1\end{bmatrix} , \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \ \ \ \ 
 \begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 1\end{bmatrix} \mapsto \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ - 1\end{bmatrix} , \\
$$
which matches what I wrote originally.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>For completeness, I'll also explain how to work out the action of $j_\star$.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The full space $S^1 = U \cup V$ has a single path-component, so
$$ H_0(S^1) \cong \mathbb Z$$
The generator $1 \in H_0(S^1)$ is the homology class of any point in $S^1$.</p></li>
<li><p>Under the inclusion $U \hookrightarrow S^1$, a point in $U$ simply becomes a point in $S^1$. So the map
$$ H_0(U) \to H_0(S^1) $$
induced by this inclusion map is given by
$$ 1 \mapsto 1.$$</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, the inclusion map $V \hookrightarrow S^1$ induces the map
$$ H_0(V) \to H_0(S^1) $$
defined by
$$ 1 \mapsto 1.$$</p></li>
<li><p>By definition, the map
$$ j_\star : H_0(U) \oplus H_0(V) \to H_0(S^1)$$
is given by applying the two inclusion-induced maps described in my previous two bullet-points to $H_0(U)$ and $H_0(V)$ separately, then adding up the two answers. In other words, it is given by
$$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \mapsto 1, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \mapsto 1.$$</p></li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, it is perhaps worth checking that ${\rm Im}(k_\star) = {\rm Ker}(j_\star)$ - and this is true, because both ${\rm Im}(k_\star)$ and ${\rm Ker}(j_\star)$ are generated by $(1, -1) \in H_0(U) \oplus H_0(V)$. We should also check that ${\rm Im}(j_\star) = H_0(S^1) $, and indeed this is true as well.</p>

"2397303","2397508","<p>I understand why you're confused!  Perhaps Bob explains this in the lectures (I haven't watched the videos), but from the PDF notes and homework alone I don't see how you could guess what's going on here; and it's actually a really subtle thing that it took me a long time to even vaguely understand.</p>

<p>There are a lot of different ways of presenting logic as a formal system.  Three of the most common are (1) Hilbert systems, (2) natural deduction, and (3) sequent calculus.  Bob disparages Hilbert systems a bit on p9 of the week 1 notes; they do have a conceptual explanation in terms of combinatory logic and closed categories, but they're not relevant to the point here.  Natural deduction and sequent calculus both work with ""entailments"" $\Gamma\vdash A$ separate from implication, making explicit a context of ""hypotheses"", and both divide the logical rules into ways to ""use"" things and ways to ""prove"" things; the differences are in the details.</p>

<p>The ""prove"" rules are called ""introduction"" rules in natural deduction and ""right"" rules in sequent calculus, but in both cases they look basically the same: they introduce a new connective in the <em>consequent</em> of the <em>conclusion</em>.  (In $\Gamma\vdash A$ the $\Gamma$ is the <em>antecedents</em> or <em>context</em> or <em>hypotheses</em> while $A$ is the <em>consequent</em>, whereas in a rule $\frac{J_1 \quad J_2}{J_3}$ the judgments $J_1,J_2$ above the line are <em>premises</em> and the $J_3$ below the line is the <em>conclusion</em>.)  By contrast, the ""use"" rules of natural deduction are called ""elimination"" rules and ""get rid of"" a connective in the <em>consequent</em> of a <em>premise</em>, whereas the ""use"" rules of sequent calculus are called ""left"" rules and introduce a new connective as an <em>antecedent</em> of the <em>conclusion</em>.  Thus for instance the elimination rule for $\vee$ in natural deduction is</p>

<p>$$\frac{ \Gamma,A\vdash C \qquad \Gamma,B\vdash C \qquad \Gamma\vdash A\vee B }{\Gamma\vdash C} $$</p>

<p>whereas the left rule for $\vee$ in sequent calculus is</p>

<p>$$\frac{\Gamma,A\vdash C \qquad \Gamma,B\vdash C}{\Gamma,A\vee B \vdash C}$$</p>

<p>Thus, in natural deduction, to prove $C$ using a ""case split"" on $A\vee B$, you do three things: (1) prove $A\vee B$, (2) prove $C$ assuming $A$, and (3) prove $C$ assuming $B$.  Whereas in sequent calculus, to prove $C$ using a case split on $A\vee B$, you have to <em>already have $A\vee B$ as a hypothesis</em>, and then you do only (2) and (3).</p>

<p>It follows that the ""transitivity"" or ""using lemmas"" rule (which is also called ""composition"", ""substitution"", and ""cut"") has a different status in the two cases.  In natural deduction, transitivity is <em>built into</em> most of the rules: e.g. if you have a lemma that proves $A\vee B$, there's hardly anything to prove when claiming that such a lemma can be used in the middle of another proof to justify a case split, since the primitive rule for ""using a $\vee$"" says that you get to give a proof of $A\vee B$, so you can just slot in the proof of the lemma.  In sequent calculus this is not the case: to justify using a lemma for $A\vee B$, you have to inspect the proofs of the lemma and of the theorem that wants to use the lemma and match up the corresponding parts inductively; this is called <em>cut elimination</em> or <em>cut admissibility</em>.</p>

<p>Overall, this difference means that sequent calculus is more ""spartan"": there are fewer proofs and less redundancy.  In natural deduction, you can do all sorts of detours in a proof, introducing a new statement and then immediately eliminating it.  Sequent calculus forbids that, mandating that new connectives be introduced (never eliminated) as you pass <em>downwards</em> through the proof; this has many nice metatheoretic consequences like the ""subformula property"".  There is a formal way of ""eliminating the redundancy"" in natural deduction, called <em>normalization</em>: basically whenever you eliminate something that was introduced, you can excise that part of the proof.  Such normalization corresponds (roughly) to the more involved process of cut-elimination in sequent calculus, and the ""normal"" natural deduction proofs correspond (again, roughly) to the proofs of sequent calculus.  Under the Curry-Howard correspondence to $\lambda$-calculus, a natural deduction proof can contain ""redexes"" such as $(\lambda x.M)(N)$, which can be $\beta$-reduced to $M[N/x]$ (i.e. $M$ with $N$ substituted for $x$), whereas a sequent calculus produces the normal forms directly without allowing any redexes.</p>

<p>The solution given by Bob to the exercise you're wondering about, then, is the solution that you would have to give in a <em>sequent calculus</em>, whereas the simple argument you suggest works only in a <em>natural deduction</em>, because it involves an elimination rule acting on a connective in a premise.  So it's no wonder you were confused, because the notes (at least) don't say anything about sequent calculus, presenting only the rules of natural deduction!  I don't know what Bob intended here; perhaps it was made clearer in the lectures or by personal communication to the students.</p>

<p>Finally, the kind of induction Bob is doing that you may not be used to is called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_induction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">structural induction</a>.  Induction on natural numbers is just one kind of induction; you can do induction on any kind of ""inductively generated"" structure; here he is inducting on proofs, which are generated inductively from inference rules.</p>

"2397358","2397375","<p>A relation is asymmetric if and only if it is anti-symmetric and irreflexive.</p>

<p>So, the second definition can be rewritten as:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Irreflexive</p></li>
<li><p>Anti-symmetric</p></li>
<li><p>Transitive</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And now the relation between the two definitions is a little more clear:  they are both transitive and anti-symmetric, but the strict one is irreflexive, and the non-strict one is reflexive.</p>

<p>Note that a 'non-strict' partial order is not the same as a relation that is anti-symmetric, transitive, but not strict, for it could be anti-symmetric, transitive, but neither reflexive nor irreflexive ... I also wish there was a term for relations that are anti-symmetric and transitive (and I believe 'order' fits the bill just right) ... but I get the impression that we don't consider such 'in-between orders' because they are mathematically not that interesting ... see also:</p>

<p><a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2210560/orders-partial-orders-strict-partial-orders-total-orders-strict-total-orders"">Orders, Partial Orders, Strict Partial Orders, Total Orders, Strict Total Orders, and Strict Orders</a></p>

<p>As far as the connection with trichotomy goes: There I do not understand the textbook. Trichotomy for any relation $R$ is that for any two objects $x$ and $y$: $xRy$ or $yRx$ or $x=y$. Put differently: if $x \not = y$, then either $xRy$ or $yRx$, which is also known as a 'connex' relationship: every two different elements are 'connected'. Thus, for example, $\subseteq$ is not connex, as $\{ 1 \}$ and $\{ 2 \}$ do not stand in the $\subseteq$ relation in any way, but $\le$ is connex ... which is also why we call it a 'total' order (a relation is 'total' when for any $x$ and $y$, either $xRy$ or $yRx$ ... note that connex/trichotomy plus reflexive implies total).</p>

<p>But $\le$ is clearly not strict. That is, $\le$ is a partial order that is connex (i.e for which trichotomy holds), but it is not a strict partial order. </p>

<p>So, frankly, I disagree with the book on that one: the difference between 'non-strict' and 'strict' is not 'connex' or trichotomy (<em>that</em> is the difference between partial and total). Rather, the difference between 'strict' and 'non-strict' is the difference between reflexive and irreflexive.</p>

Your function <code>f</code> depends on not just abstract symbolic functions, but also their derivatives. The problem is that <code>subs(f,th,v)</code> by itself returns zero. This is because the substitution also replaces the <code>th(t)</code> inside <code>diff(th(t),t)</code> with a constant symbolic variable that is not a function of time. The derivative of a constant is zero so your entire function simplifies to zero.</p>

<p>To work with an equation like this you need to replace <code>diff(th(t),t)</code> with something else so that it is not impacted by the substitution. This can be done fairly painlessly by using the <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/subs.html#btqh71e-1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">multiple substitution</a> capabilities of <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/subs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>sym/subs</code></a>:</p>

syms x dx
v2 = subs(v,{th,diff(th,t)},{x,dx}); % Order does not matter if done at same time
v3 = diff(v2,x);
dvdth = subs(v3,{x,dx},{th,diff(th,t)})
</code></pre>

<p>Or more compactly (but very hard to read):</p>

<pre><code>syms t a1 a2 m2 th(t) p(t) x dx
v = m2*a1*a2*diff(p,t)*diff(th,t)*cos(th-p);
dvdth = subs(diff(subs(v,{th,diff(th,t)},{x,dx}),x),{x,dx},{th,diff(th,t)})

"2397713","2397739","<p>1) If you want to use closed + bounded $\implies$ convergent subsequence, then you have to start with a sequence.  But this is a weasely way to address your question.  Here's a better way.  </p>

<p>Suppose there were no <em>best</em> approximation in $U$.  Then there is surely a sequence of successively improving approximants in $U$.  (Otherwise: ""Hey, look!  We found the best approximant."")  The rest of the proof goes on to show that the resulting sequence has an eventually constant subsequence.  (It's worth pointing out there can be multiple best approximants and our starting sequence can eventually settle down to just output these ""with some random pattern of repetition"".  But then at least one of them is repeatedly infinitely often, so there is a convergent subsequence.)</p>

<p>If you start by writing down (one of) the best approximants, then you are of course done.  How do you do this generically and simultaneously for all finite dimensional subspaces of all normed spaces?  That's trickier.  Are we even sure that sequences of improving approximants ever settle down in unfamiliar spaces and/or with unfamiliar norms?</p>

<p>2) ""$||\phi - u_n|| \longrightarrow d$"" means for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there exists a positive integer $N$, such that for all $n &gt; N$, $||\phi - u_n|| \in (d- \varepsilon, d + \varepsilon)$.  Consequently, the first term on the right hand side is bounded by, say, $d + 1$ for sufficiently large $n$.  So the right hand side is bounded by $||\varphi|| + d + 1$.  (In fact any number $||\varphi|| + d + \varepsilon$ for $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ is established as an upper bound by this argument.)</p>

<p>3) After the first equation, I have an infimum on the right-hand side.  There's no reason to believe that the infimum is actually attained by any $u \in U$.  (In fact, this is what we are trying to prove: that there is a $u$ for which the infimum is attained.)  Also, I have a limit on the left-hand side.  Again, there's no reason to assume that there is a $u_n$ that makes ""$\rightarrow$"" actually ""$=$"".  So you have a sequence of $u_n$ that can get you as close as you like to $d$ and you know there are elements of $U$ that can get you as close as you like to $d$ from above.  How do you know that you can ever actually attain $d$?  </p>

<p>(It's counterfactual for this problem, but could be a useful example of how the idea your third question suggests doesn't quite work.  Suppose the limit on the left-hand side were only approached from below.  Then the <em>upper bound</em> for the left-hand side would match the <em>lower bound</em> for the right-hand side.  But that wouldn't tell you that any value appearing in the sequence on the left agreed with any value in the set on the right.  Unless both actually attain their bounds.  So there's more to do.)</p>

"2397723","2397771","<p><strong>It's been a while since I've had to explain the process of solving second order ODE's, so if anyone finds a mistake in this please do let me know</strong></p>

<p>In order to solve this differential equation you would have to learn how to solve Second-Order Differential equations in general. The equation you have provided is known as a Second-Order Inhomogenous Linear Ordinary Differential Equation with Constant Coefficients.</p>

<p>These are of the form (<em>Note that $q$ in this equation ONLY is not the same as your  charge function q</em>):</p>

<p>$$y''+py'+qy=r(x)$$</p>

<p><em>Second-Order</em>: Involves the second derivative of $y$</p>

<p><em>Linear</em>: It is of the form $p_0(x)\frac{d^ny}{dy^n}+p_1(x)\frac{d^{n-1}y}{dy^{n-1}}+p_2(x)\frac{d^{n-2}y}{dx^{n-2}}+...+p_ny(x)=r(x)$</p>

<p><em>Inhomogenous</em>: $r(x) \neq 0$</p>

<p><em>Constant Coefficients</em>: $p$ and $q$ are constants.</p>

<p>Your equation in this form is:</p>

<p>$$-Lq''+Rq'+\frac{q}{C}=-V\Rightarrow q''-\frac{R}{L}q'-\frac{1}{LC}q=\frac{V}{L}$$</p>

<p>To solve this we must do the proceed with the following steps:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Finding the complementary solution</p>

<p>We start by solving the equivalent homogenous problem $y''+py'+qy=0$</p>

<p>Setting $V=0$</p>

<p>$$ q''-\frac{R}{L}q'-\frac{1}{LC}q=0$$</p>

<p>Now we need to find what is known as an <strong>auxillary equation</strong>. We consider that $q$ is of the form $e^{mt}$.</p>

<p>$$q=e^{mt},\,q'=me^{mt},q''=m^2e^{mt}$$</p>

<p>If we plug these in and rearrange, we get:</p>

<p>$$e^{mt}(m^2-\frac{R}{L}m-\frac{1}{LC})=0$$</p>

<p>Since $e^{mt}\neq0$, then $(m^2-\frac{R}{L}m-\frac{1}{LC})=0$ </p>

<p>This is a quadratic equation with solutions:</p>

<p>$$m_{1,2}=\frac{\frac{R}{L}\pm\sqrt{\frac{R^2}{L^2}-\frac{4}{LC}}}{2}\Rightarrow m_1=\frac{\frac{R}{L}+\sqrt{\frac{R^2}{L^2}-\frac{4}{LC}}}{2},m_2=\frac{\frac{R}{L}-\sqrt{\frac{R^2}{L^2}-\frac{4}{LC}}}{2}$$</p>

<p>The discriminant of the roots $\Delta = \frac{R^2}{L^2}-\frac{4}{LC}$ causes three different cases to arise:</p>

<p><em>Case 1</em>:$\Delta&gt;0$, which tells us we have two <em>distinct</em> real roots, and in this case we get two linearly independent solutions:</p>

<p>$$q_1=e^{m_1t},q_2=e^{m_2t}$$ </p>

<p>which gives us the complementary solution:</p>

<p>$$q_c(t)=C_1e^{m_1t}+C_2e^{m_2t}$$</p>

<p><em>Case 2:</em>$\Delta=0$, which tells us we have a double repeated root ($m_1=m_2=m$), and in this case we get two linearly independent solutions:</p>

<p>$$q_1=e^{mt},q_2=te^{mt}$$ </p>

<p>which gives us the complementary solution:</p>

<p>$$q_c(t)=C_1e^{mt}+C_2te^{mt}$$</p>

<p><em>Case 3:</em>$\Delta&lt;0$, which tells us we have a two <em>distinct</em> complex roots and in this case we get two linearly independent solutions:</p>

<p>$$q_1=e^{(a+ib)t}=e^{at}(\cos bt+i\sin bt), q_2 = e^{(a-ib)t}=e^{at}(\cos bt-i\sin bt)$$</p>

<p>which gives us the complementary solution:</p>

<p>$$q_c(t)=e^{at}[C_1(\cos bt+ i\sin bt)+C_2(\cos bt - i \sin bt)]$$</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> We find the particular solution (or particular integral), and this usually is a trial-and-error approach where your decision depends on the form that $r(x)$ comes in. In our case $r(x)=V$, which is just a constant function of $t$. So we will make the guess that $q_p=A$, another constant function of $t$.</p>

<p>Plugging this in we get: 
$$-\frac{A}{LC}=\frac{V}{L}\Rightarrow A=-CV$$ 
And if my knowledge of Electrical Physics is correct, I believe that $CV=Q$</p>

<p>Therefore,</p>

<p>$$q_p=-CV=-Q$$</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now that we have our complementary and particular solutions, all we need to do is add them together to get our general solution. Hence for cases $1$ and $3$,</p>

<p>$$q(t)=q_c+q_p\Rightarrow q(t)=C_1e^{m_1t}+C_2e^{m_2t}-Q$$</p>

<p>or for case $2$,</p>

<p>$$q(t)=q_c+q_p\Rightarrow q(t)=C_1e^{mt}+C_2te^{mt}-Q$$</p>

<p>The constants $C_1,C_2$ and $Q$ can only be determined by knowing values of $q(t)$ at different times $t$, which brings two new problems in differential equations known as Initial-Value Problems and Boundary-Value Problems.</p>

<p>I believe in your specific equation the electrical circuit is undamped, which means $\Delta&lt;0$ and that is how the ""exponentially decreasing sine wave function arises"".</p>

<p>Hope this gives you some insight on how to solve Second-Order ODE's.</p>

$$60000=400(2\sqrt{25}+0)+C \implies C=56000$$
Therefore, we obtain the population at $t=5$ as:
$$P(5)=400(2\sqrt{5^2+25}+5)+56000=2000(2\sqrt{2}+1)+56000 \approx 63656.8542$$</p>

<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>

<p>Setting the appropriate bounds and separating variables:
$$\int_{60000}^{P(5)} dP=\int_0^5 400\left(1+\frac{2t}{\sqrt{25+t^2}}\right)~dt$$
Evaluating the integrals, we obtain:
$$P(5)-60000=2000(2\sqrt{2}-1)$$
Solving for $P(5)$ gives us the population at $t=5$ years:
$$\begin{align}P(5)&amp;=2000(2\sqrt{2}-1)+60000\\&amp;=2000(2\sqrt{2}+1)+56000 \end{align}$$
The answer is the same as in Method 1.</p>

"2397781","2397789","<p>Sure, this occurs naturally. Consider $F = \mathbb Q$ and its algebraic closure $K = \bar{\mathbb Q}$. Now consider $\mathbb Q$ as a subfield of $K' = \mathbb C$. </p>

<p>$\mathbb C$ is algebraically closed, its an extension of $\mathbb Q$ but it is not algebraic over $\mathbb Q$.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> Here is another example. Let $F$ be a finite field and let $K$ be its algebraic closure. Let $F \subseteq F'$ be an extension of $F$ of sufficiently large cardinality (i.e. uncountable) and let $K'$ be the algebraic closure of $F'$. (*)</p>

<p>$K'$ is a field extension of $F$ that is algebraically closed but it cannot be algebraic over $F$ because its cardinality is too large. I.e. there are only countable many polynomial roots over $F[X]$ but $K'$ contains uncountably many elements - most of which cannot be algebraic over $F$. In this fashion you can get an arbitrarily large 'gap' between the cardinality of the algebraic closure of $F$ and an algebraically closed extension. (The fact that $F$ is finite is irrelevant here - I simply thought it might help to make this example more approachable.)</p>

<p>(*) Note that $F'$ exists by the existence of the infinite field $K$ and the upward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem, but you can also just view it as a field extension $F' = F(x_i \mid i \in I)$ with indepenent $x_i$ and $I$ uncountable.</p>

$$\tag{*}    \lim_{j\to +\infty}      \int_{\mathbb R^N}u_{n_j} (x)v(x)\mathbf 1_{B_R}(x)\mathrm dx =\int_{\mathbb R^N}u_R (x)v(x)\mathbf 1_{B_R}(x)\mathrm dx.      $$<br>
By the diagonal process, the subsequence can be chosen independently of $R$, hence (*) holds for a fixed sequence $\left(n_j\right)_{j\geqslant 1}$. 
Also, observe that $u_R=u_{R'}$ on $B_R$ if $R \lt R'$ hence we can safely remove the dependence in $R$ write $u_R=u$. For the moment, we got the following: there exists an increasing sequence of integers $\left(n_j\right)_{j\geqslant 1}$ and a function $u$ such that for any integer $R$ and any $v\in\mathbb L^\infty$, 
 $$     \lim_{j\to +\infty}      \int_{\mathbb R^N}u_{n_j} (x)v(x)\mathbf 1_{B_R}(x)\mathrm dx =\int_{\mathbb R^N}u (x)v(x)\mathbf 1_{B_R}(x)\mathrm dx.      $$<br>
Now, we use the tightness assumption: for any positive $\varepsilon$, there exists $R$ such that for all $j$,
$$\left\lvert \int_{\mathbb R^N}u_{n_j} (x)v(x)\left(1- \mathbf 1_{B_R}(x)\right) \mathrm dx\right\rvert\leqslant \varepsilon\left\lVert v\right\rVert_{\mathbb L^\infty}              $$ 
and the same holds with $u_{n_j}$ replaced by $u$. This proves that $u_{n_j}\to u$ weakly in $\mathbb L^1$.       </p>

"2397994","2398004","<p>A linear operator $P$ on a space $V$ is a projector if it satisfies $P^2=P$. When that is the case, the image of$~P$ (acting from the left on vectors) is a subspace $A\subseteq V$ with (by definition) $P\cdot v\in A$ for all $v\in V$, and moreover $P|_A=\mathrm{id}_A$. Dually there is an image subspace $B\subseteq V^*$ for $P$ acting on the right on the dual space $V^*$, with (again by definition) $\phi\cdot P\in B$ for all linear forms $\phi\in V^*$, and $P$ acts on the right as the identity on$~B$.

<p>The first term is bounded, and the second integral is $O(\sqrt{n})$ as one sees from the boundedness of $\sin \sqrt{t}$ and $\lbrace t\rbrace - \frac{1}{2}$. It thus remains to estimate</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\int_1^n \cos \sqrt{t}\,dt &amp;= 2\int_1^{\sqrt{n}} u\cos u\,du \\
&amp;= 2u\sin u \biggr\rvert_1^{\sqrt{n}} - 2\int_1^{\sqrt{n}} \sin u\,du \\
&amp;= 2\sqrt{n}\sin \sqrt{n} - 2\sin 1 + 2\cos \sqrt{n} - 2,
\end{align}</p>

<p>which clearly is in $O(\sqrt{n})$.</p>

<p>Generally, for $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, we obtain</p>

<p>$$\sum_{k = 1}^n \cos k^{\alpha} = \frac{\cos 1 + \cos n^{\alpha}}{2} + \int_1^n \cos t^{\alpha}\,dt - \alpha\int_1^n p_1(t)t^{\alpha-1}\sin t^{\alpha}\,dt,\tag{$\ast$}$$</p>

<p>where $p_1(t) = \lbrace t\rbrace - \frac{1}{2}$. We can estimate the first integral substituting $u = t^{\alpha}$ and integrating by parts:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\int_1^n \cos t^{\alpha}\,dt &amp;= \frac{1}{\alpha} \int_1^{n^{\alpha}} u^{\frac{1}{\alpha}-1}\cos u\,du \\

\end{align}</p>

<p>The first term is $\frac{1}{\alpha}\bigl(n^{1-\alpha}\sin n^{\alpha} - \sin 1\bigr)$, and using $\lvert \sin u\rvert \leqslant 1$ we see that the remaining integral also belongs to $O(n^{1-\alpha})$.</p>

<p>For the integral</p>

<p>$$\alpha\int_1^n p_1(t)t^{\alpha-1}\sin t^{\alpha}\,dt,$$</p>

<p>we immediately obtain an $O(n^{\alpha})$ bound using the boundedness of $p_1$ and $\sin$. For $\alpha \leqslant \frac{1}{2}$, this is smaller than the bound on the other integral. For $\alpha &gt; \frac{1}{2}$, we still have an $O(n^{\alpha})$ bound for the sum, which suffices to conclude that</p>

<p>$$\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{\cos k^{\alpha}}{k}$$</p>

<p>converges. But we can lower the bound using integration by parts:</p>

<p>$$\int_1^n p_1(t) t^{\alpha-1} \sin t^{\alpha} = p_2(t)t^{\alpha-1}\sin t^{\alpha}\biggr\rvert_1^n - (\alpha-1)\int_1^n p_2(t)t^{\alpha-2}\sin t^{\alpha}\,dt - \alpha \int_1^n p_2(t)t^{2(\alpha-1)}\cos t^{\alpha}\,dt$$</p>

<p>where the first two terms on the right are bounded, and the last integral is elementarily bounded by $C\cdot n^{2\alpha - 1}$. Continuing integration by parts, we find that the last integral in $(\ast)$ belongs to $O(n^{1 - m(1-\alpha)})$ for every $0 &lt; m \leqslant \frac{1}{1-\alpha}$, and then eventually we obtain</p>

<p>$$\int_1^n p_1(t)t^{\alpha-1}\sin t^{\alpha}\,dt \in O(1),$$</p>

<p>so the sum belongs to $O(n^{1-\alpha})$ for every $\alpha \in (0,1)$ [this is also true for $\alpha = 0$ and $\alpha = 1$].</p>

<p>$$\bigl(2m - \tfrac{1}{3}\bigr)\pi \leqslant k^{\alpha} \leqslant \bigl(2m + \tfrac{1}{3}\bigr)\pi,$$</p>

<p>we see that the bound above is sharp. For $n \approx \bigl((2m+\frac{1}{3})\pi\bigr)^{1/\alpha}$, we have $\Theta(n^{1-\alpha})$ successive terms that are $\geqslant \frac{1}{2}$, whence the partial sum must have had at least order $\ell^{1-\alpha}$ for some $\ell \leqslant n$.</p>

"2398054","2398139","<p>Your logic is entirely right, but I believe you've miscounted the ways of having 3+2+2 flavours.</p>

<p>Since each pair of cones must share one flavour that the third doesn't have, and there are ways of choosing a pair of cones, three of your flavours must be assigned in this way - e.g. flavour $A$ to cones $1$ and $2$, $B$ to cones $1$ and $3$, and $C$ to cones $2$ and $3$ - leaving one flavour, $D$.</p>

<p>As you rightly note, this leftover flavour can then either be placed on no cones, 1 cone, or 2 cones, but not all 3. </p>

<ul>
<li>If we have 2+2+2, one flavour is left out, and permuting the other three is the same as permuting cones. There are thus $4!/3! = 4$ ways to assign flavours.</li>
<li>If we have 3+2+2, e.g. $ABD$, $AC$, and $BC$, then one flavour only appears once, and on the 3-scoop cone ($D$) and one flavour is not on that cone ($C$). Swapping the other two flavours ($A$ and $B$) is the same as swapping the 2-scoop cones, so $A$ and $B$ are indistinguishable. So there are $4!/2! = 12$ ways of doing this. <strong>This is where we differ</strong>.</li>
<li>If we have 3+3+2, e.g. $AB$, $ACD$, and $BCD$, then swapping $A$ and $B$ is equivalent to swapping the latter two cones, while $C$ and $D$ are clearly indistinguishable from each other. We have two pairs of indistinguishable flavours, so there are $4!/(2!*2!)=6$ ways of assigning flavours.</li>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Let us switch to the side question how to extract the leading behavior of
$f_n' = \sum\limits_{k=0}^n f_k$.<br>
The OGF of $f_n'$ is given by the formula.</p>

<p>$${\rm OGF}' = \sum_{k=0}^n f_n' x^n = \frac{\rm OFG}{1-x} =
\frac{\cos\theta_0\sqrt{1-cx} - \sin\theta_0\sqrt{1+cx}}{1-x}$$</p>

<p>When $a = 0$, OCF' is just constant $0$ and all $f_n' = 0$.</p>

<p>When $a = \frac12$, $c = 1$ and OCF' reduces to $\sqrt{1-x}$. It is easy to show $f_n'$ falls of like $n^{-1/2}$.</p>

<p>For the remaining cases, what happens depends on whether $a$ is far way or near $\frac12$.  </p>

<p>When $a$ is far away from $\frac12$, everything is relatively simple.</p>

<p>The numerator of OCF' has two branch cuts ends at $\pm \frac1c$ and an zero at $x = 1$. This cancels out a potential pole from denominator. OGF' remains to be regular at $x = 1$ and the leading behavior of $f_n'$ is controlled by the behavior of OGF' at $\pm \frac1c$.</p>

<p>For $x$ sufficiently close to $\frac1c$, we have the expansion</p>

<p>$$\frac{\sqrt{1-cx}}{1-x} = -\frac{c}{1-c}\frac{\sqrt{1-cx}}{1 - \frac{(1-cx)}{1-c}}
= -\sum_{\ell=0}^\infty\frac{c}{(1-c)^{\ell+1}} (1-cx)^{\ell+\frac12}

$$</p>

<p>Notice for any $\alpha &gt; 0$ and $|z| &lt; 1$,</p>

<p>$$(1-z)^\alpha = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \binom{\alpha}{k} z^k
\quad\text{ and }\quad
(-1)^k\binom{\alpha}{k} = \frac{1}{\Gamma(-\alpha)k^{\alpha+1}}(1 + O(k^{-1}))\;$$</p>

<p>As far as leading behavior of $f_n'$ are concerned, we only need to keep the $\ell = 0$ term in $(*1a)$.<br>
This is because contributions from the $\ell &gt; 0$ terms have an extra factor $\frac{1}{((1-c)n)^\ell}$ attached to them. Since $a$ is far way from $\frac12$, $(1-c)$ will not be too small and we can safely all of these.</p>

<p>Once again, contribution from the $\ell &gt; 0$ terms have an extra factor $\frac{1}{((1+c)n)^\ell}$ attached to them. We only need to keep the $\ell = 0$ term in $(*1b)$ in the extraction of leading behavior of $f_n'$. </p>

<p>At the end, we find when $a$ is far from $\frac12$, the leading behavior of $f_n'$ is of the form $O(n^{-3/2})$.</p>

<p>$$f_n' \approx \frac{c^{n+1}}{2\sqrt{\pi n^3}}\times \begin{cases}

\frac{\cos\theta_0}{1-c} - \frac{\sin\theta_0}{1+c}, &amp; n \text{ odd}\\
\end{cases}
$$</p>

<p>For the final case when $a$ is close to $\frac12$, the situation is more
complicated. I have no idea how to extract the leading behavior in a form depends on $a$ uniformly. </p>

<p>When $a \to \frac12^-$, $\frac{1}{1-c}\to \infty$. One no longer able to blindly ignore all the $\ell &gt; 0$ terms in expansion of $(*1a)$.
One consequence of this is when $a \to \frac12^-$, above approximation fails to reproduce the $O(n^{-\frac12})$ behavior of $f_n'$ at $a = \frac12$.</p>

<p>If one want the leading behavior of $f_n'$ for $a$ near $\frac12$, one
should consider how to vary $a$ as one sends $n$ to infinity.</p>

"2398131","2398135","<p>If you want a realistic answer to this, you would of course need to take into account that you can't pack the Boeing 'perfectly'; there will be lots of gaps and spaces depending on how the cargo bay is shaped.  Even if you had a perfect rectangular box you would of course still have gaps between the poker chips, since they are round.</p>

<p>But for a rough approximation, maybe do exactly that: consider the Boeing cargo bay to be a rectangular box, and consider stacking the chips as little rectangular 'boxes' (a hexagonal packing would be more efficient, but someone else can do the math for that ...) of 39mm by 39mm. So then the volume of a single chip is $39 \cdot 39 \cdot 3.3 \ =5019.3 mm^3$</p>

<p>Proving existence of (2) $\implies$ (1). In order to prove (2), all we have to do is prove that there exists <em>a</em> positive root, since by strict monotonicity, we know it will be unique. As such, since $f$ is differentiable on $(0, \infty)$, and we know that $f(0) = -a &lt; 0$ and we also know $f(x)\to \infty$ whenever $x \to \infty$ then there exists at least one $x\in (0, \infty)$ such that $f(x)=0$ as we know $f$ is continuous (by its differentiability).

"2398152","2398364","<p>Since $2^a = 3^b \iff a\ln 2 = b\ln 3$, under the constraint that $\nu + \mu = N$ we have $2^{\nu} = 3^{\mu}$ for $\nu = \frac{\ln 3}{\ln 6}N$ and $\mu = \frac{\ln 2}{\ln 6}N$. The smallest distance $\lvert 2^n - 3^m\rvert$ for $m,n$ integers with $n + m = N$ therefore occurs when $n = \lfloor \nu\rfloor$ or $n = \lceil \nu\rceil$. Writing $\delta = n - \nu$, we thus have $-1 &lt; \delta &lt; 1$ and</p>

<p>$$D = \lvert 2^n - 3^m\rvert = \lvert 2^{\nu + \delta} - 3^{\mu - \delta}\rvert = \exp \biggl( \frac{(\ln 2)(\ln 3)}{\ln 6}N\biggr)\cdot \lvert 2^{\delta} - 3^{-\delta}\rvert.$$</p>

<p>Thus</p>

<p>$$\ln D = \frac{(\ln 2)(\ln 3)}{\ln 6}N + \ln \lvert 2^{\delta} - 3^{-\delta}\rvert.$$</p>

<p>Since $C := \frac{(\ln 2)(\ln 3)}{\ln 6} \approx 0.4250012479336228$, the first term corresponds to your straight line, and that the exact values are close to that line is equivalent to $\delta$ not being too close to $0$. The inequality $\lvert \delta\rvert &lt; 1$ implies $\lvert 2^{\delta} - 3^{-\delta}\rvert &lt; 3^1 - 2^{-1} = \frac{5}{2}$, so $\ln D$ can never be much above that line. But $\delta$ can sometimes be very close to $0$. If $N$ is the denominator of a convergent of $\frac{\ln 3}{\ln 6}$, then</p>

<p>$$\biggl\lvert \frac{\ln 3}{\ln 6} - \frac{K}{N}\biggr\rvert &lt; \frac{1}{N^2},$$</p>

<p>so $\lvert \nu - K\rvert &lt; \frac{1}{N}$, hence $\lvert\delta\rvert &lt; \frac{1}{N}$, and then</p>

<p>$$2^{\delta} - 3^{-\delta} = \exp(\delta\ln 2) - \exp (-\delta\ln 3) = \delta\ln 6 + O(\delta^2),$$</p>

<p>whence $\ln D \approx C\cdot N + \ln \delta &lt; C\cdot N - \ln N$ in that case.</p>

<p>Of course a difference of $\approx \ln N$ is still small relative to $C\cdot N$. However, depending on the irrationality measure of $\frac{\ln 3}{\ln 6}$, there may be convergents where $\frac{K}{N}$ is much closer than $\frac{1}{N^2}$. If the irrationality measure is finite - and that's overwhelmingly likely - then the distance is bounded below by a power of $N$, and then we have $\lvert CN - \ln D\rvert \in O(\ln N)$. But if the irrationality measure is infinite, then $\lvert CN - \ln D\rvert$ can be of larger order than $\ln N$.</p>

"2398162","2398554","<p>No. For example, the class of (strict) linear orders in the language $\{&lt;\}$ is equal to its own reflexive reduction. But this class is not axiomatizable in first-order logic without equality. The problem is with expressing the trichotomy condition: $\forall x\, \forall y\, (x&lt;y \lor y&lt;x \lor x = y$).</p>

<p>As a silly way of seeing that this class is not axiomatizable, note that any two nonempty sets in which $&lt;$ is interpreted as $\emptyset$ are indistinguishable in first-order logic without equality. But such a set is a strict linear order if and only if it has size $1$.</p>

<hr>

<p>More generally, elementary-without-equality classes are closed under the following ""blow-up"" operation. Let $M$ be any first-order structure in a relational language, let $M'$ be any set, and let $f\colon M'\to M$ be any surjective map of sets. We turn $M'$ into a structure by setting $(a_1,\dots,a_n)\in R^{M'}$ if and only if $(f(a_1),\dots,f(a_n))\in R^M$. The idea is that we've replaced every element $b\in M$ with a nonempty set of elements $f^{-1}(\{b\})$. </p>

<p>Now you can prove by induction that for any formula $\varphi$ without equality and any tuple $\overline{a}$ from $M'$, $M'\models \varphi(\overline{a})$ if and only if $M\models \varphi(f(\overline{a}))$. In particular, $M$ and $M'$ satisfy the same sentences. So if you have a class of structures which is not closed under ""blow-up"", there's no hope for it to be axiomatizable in first-order logic without equality.</p>

"2398188","2398465","<p>Let me assume (for simplicity) that $E[X(t)]=0$ for each $t$. If $Y:=\int_{\mathcal T} X(t)\,dt$ is to be Gaussian, then it must have finite moments. So, let's also assume that

This is more than enough (by Cauchy-Schwarz) to ensure that 
$E[Y^2]&lt;\infty$, and will be needed below to justify the use of Fubini's theorem.  Let $L^2$ denote that Hilbert space of square-integrable random variables on the probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal F, P)$ of the $X(t)$, and let $\Gamma$ be the closure in $L^2$ of the linear span of $\{X(t): t\in\mathcal T\}$. Each random variable in $\Gamma$ is normally distributed (with mean $0$). To show that $Y$ is normally distributed it suffices to show that $Y\in\Gamma$; or, what is the same, that $Y\in(\Gamma^\perp)^\perp$. (Here $\perp$ indicates orthogonal complement.) That is, we must show that if $Z\in\Gamma^\perp$ (namely, if $Z\in L^2$ and $E[ZG]=0$ for every $G\in\Gamma$) then $E[ZY]=0$ as well. So fix $Z\in\Gamma^\perp$.

"2398190","2398206","<p>The 'standard' way to think about this is to say: the bowler needs an average of $170$ over $90$ games, so the bowler needs $90 \cdot 170 = 15300$ points total. So far, the bowler has managed $21 \cdot 164 = 3444$ points, so the bowler still needs $15300-3444=11856$ points, meaning that for the remaining $90-21=69$ games, the bowler needs $\frac{11856}{69} \approx 171.8$ points on average per game.</p>

<p>But here is another way to think about this:</p>

<p>For those first $21$ games the bowler was $6$ points behind the goal of getting $170$ points. So, the bowler 'lost' $6 \cdot 21 = 126$ points that the bowler needs to make up in the remaining $90-21=69$ games. That is, the bowler needs to make up $\frac{125}{69} \approx 1.8$ points per game by getting that many points over $170$ on average. So that would mean the bowler needs to bowl $\approx 170+\frac{125}{69} \approx 171.8$ points per game for the remaining season on average.</p>

<p>I not only like this approach of 'losing ground' and 'gaining ground' conceptually, but as you can see it sometimes simplifies the math in that you don't work with as big of numbers ... Indeed, I have found that there are many instances where the math is simple enough with this method that you can do this in your head, and fairly quickly too. </p>

<p>For example, if it would have been an $84$-game season, then there would have been $63$ games remaining, which is $3$ times the number of past games, so with an average 'loss' of $6$, the bowler should make an average 'gain' of $2$, so the bowler should average $172$ for the remaining games ... indeed, even though the numbers with $90$ total games do not work out to nice whole numbers, I was immediately able to tell that the bowler should average a little under $172$ just eye-balling the numbers. So this is a powerful method!</p>

If you plug this into the sum you get:
$$\frac{n!}{(n-3)!} \sum \limits_{k=3}^{n}\binom{n-3}{k-3} = \frac{n!}{(n-3)!} \sum \limits_{k=0}^{n-3}\binom{n-3}{k}  = \frac{n!}{(n-3)!} \cdot 2^{n-3}$$</p>

f(x) = f(g^n(x)) \to f(y), \forall x, n\to \infty.

So <strong>every frame validating $K'$ also validates the ""trivialization"" principle</strong> $$(*)\quad(\Diamond q)\implies (\Box q).$$ But this statement clearly implies that in such a frame, no world sees more than one world (if $aRb, aRc,$ and $b\not=c$, set $q$ true at $b$ so that $a\models\Diamond q$ and set $q$ false at $c$ so that $a\models\neg\Box q$).</p>

"2398501","2398525","<p>Suppose $(f_n)$ is Cauchy in $C^0([0,1])$. Then for each $x\in[0,1]$ we have

Thus $(f_n(x))$ is Cauchy in $\mathbb{R}$ for each $x\in[0,1]$. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is complete, there exists $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = \lim_n f_n(x)$ for each $x\in[0,1]$. It remains to show that $f\in C^0([0,1])$ and $f_n\to f$ in $C^0([0,1])$.</p>

By the fact that $(f_n)$ is Cauchy, we can choose $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $\|f_n-f_m\|_\infty &lt; \varepsilon/3$ for all $n,m\geq N$. Since $f_N$ is continuous at $x_0$, there exists $\delta&gt;0$ such that $|x-x_0|&lt;\delta$ implies

<p>Let $\vec a_n$ be the columns of $A$. Then the left side of your first inequality can be written as:</p>

<p>It follows from the properties of matrix multiplication that the entries of $A^*A$ are dot products of its columns. Specifically:</p>

<p>$$(A^*A)_{ij}=\vec a_i\cdot\vec a_j$$</p>

<p>If we take the trace, we sum over indices</p>

<p>$$\text{Tr}(A^*A)=(A^*A)_{1,1}+(A^*A)_{2,2}+...=\sum(A^*A)_{nn}=\sum\vec a_n\cdot\vec a_n$$</p>

<p>Now if we let $\sqrt{\ }$ denote an elementwise square root, we can take the trace of $\sqrt{A^*A}$ by taking the square root of the elements in the sum.</p>

<p>The problem is that $\vec x\cdot\vec x'=\vec v\cdot\vec w$ is only true when $\vec x$ is coplanar with $\vec v$ and $\vec w$ (and the origin). If $\vec x$ is not in this plane, then the angle between it and its image after rotation will be less than the angle between $\vec p$ and $\vec q$. The extreme example of this is $\vec x=\vec u$ itself. Every rotation about $\vec u$ leaves it fixed, so the angle between $\vec x$ and $\vec x'$ is zero regardless of the rotation angle.  </p>

<p>The reason for this is that a rotation acts only on the component of a vector that’s orthogonal to the rotation axis, i.e., on its projection onto a plane perpendicular to $\vec u$. Imagine a unit sphere with $\vec u$ as the north pole. $\vec v$ and $\vec w$ are then on its equator and the angle between them is the difference in their longitudes. For any other unit vector $\vec x$, the angle between the projections of $\vec x$ and $\vec x'$ onto the equatorial plane is indeed equal to the rotation angle—this again the difference in longitudes—but the angle between $\vec x$ and $\vec x'$ themselves is measured in the plane defined by them and the origin. The greater the latitude of $\vec x$, the smaller this true angle gets.</p>

"2398634","2398845","<p>One of the most important uses of beta distributions is in Bayesian
statistical analysis of binomial data. Beta distributions are used for
prior and posterior distributions. I will give an elementary example below.</p>

<p>In Bayesian statistics a beta distribution is used as a model for the
binomial success probability, which I will denote as $\theta$ (instead of $p$).
[Bayesian analysis treats $\theta$ as a random variable, rather than as
an unknown fixed parameter.]</p>

<p>Suppose you are wondering whether Proposition A will get a majority of
the vote at the next election. The circumstances are that Prop A had to
have some support in order to get on the ballot. Also a similar proposition
passed with about 65% of the vote at the last election. That may be
good or bad: perhaps good because it may show voters favor such propositions;
perhaps bad because such propositions require a slight increase in property
taxes and it may be too soon to ask again.
Everything considered, you think Prop A may be favored by slightly more
than half of the voters, but that the election is likely to be close. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because
  $0 \le \theta \le 1$ a beta distribution seems appropriate because
  beta distributions have support $[0,1].$ </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no precisely correct
prior distribution for $\theta,$ because it should reflect your personal
opinion. 
Suppose you choose the prior distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(\alpha_0 = 330, \beta_0=270).$
The 'kernel' of its PDF (omitting the constant of integration) is 
$f(\theta) \propto \theta^{\alpha - 1}(1-\theta)^{\beta-1},$ where the 
symbol $\propto$ indicates omission of the constant. It has mean 0.55, mode 0.5502, and median 0.55006. Also, 
$P(0.51 &lt; \theta &lt; 0.59) \approx 0.95,$ as computed in R statistical software.</p>

<pre><code>qbeta(.5, 330, 270)                         #  'qbeta' is inverse CDF
## 0.5500556
pbeta(.59, 330, 270) - pbeta(.51, 330, 270) #  'pbeta' is CDF
## 0.9513758
</code></pre>

<p>Now suppose that a well-run poll of $n = 1000$ randomly chosen likely voters
shows $x = 620$ in favor of Prop A and $n - x  = 380$ opposed. The likelihood
function corresponding to these results is 
$f(x|\theta) \propto \theta^x(1-\theta)^{n-x}.$</p>

<p>Bayes Theorem states that the posterior distribution $f(\theta|x)$ is found
by multiplying the prior and likelihood functions:
$$f(\theta|x) \propto \theta^{\alpha_0 - 1}(1-\theta)^{\beta_0-1}
\times \theta^x(1-\theta)^{n-x}.$$</p>

<p>In our example, $$f(\theta|x) = 
\theta^{\alpha_0 + x -1}(1-\theta)^{\beta_0 + n - x -1} = 
\theta^{\alpha_n - 1}(1-\theta)^{\beta_n - 1},$$
where $\alpha_n = 950$ and $\beta_n = 650.$
We recognize $f(\theta|x)$ as the kernel of $\mathsf{Beta}(950, 650).$</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We say that the beta prior and the binomial likelihood are 'conjugate' 
  (mathematically compatible). [Without conjugacy we would not be able to
  recognize the posterior distribution so easily, and we would have to
  use a different form a Bayes' Theorem in which a denominator might
  need to be integrated by numerical methods.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, a 95% posterior probability interval for $\theta$ is $(0.570, 0.618).$</p>

<pre><code>qbeta(c(.025,.975), 950, 650)
## 0.5695848 0.6176932
</code></pre>

<p>A melding of the information in the prior and the likelihood has given a
somewhat more optimistic estimate of the chances Prop A will pass, than
did our prior distribution.</p>

<hr>

<p>Notes: (1) If we had used the noninformative prior distribution $\mathsf{Unif}(0,1) \equiv \mathsf{Beta}(1,1),$ then the posterior distribution would have
been $\mathsf{Beta}(621,381)$ with a 95% posterior probability interval
$(0.589, 0.650).$ This is numerically the same (to three places) as a frequentist Agresti-style 95% confidence interval for $\theta$. However, Bayesian and frequentist interval estimates have somewhat different interpretations.</p>

"2398646","2398755","<p>Your idea is correct. The expression<br>
$$\alpha \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(n\alpha)$$
is like Riemann sum for $\int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,d\xi$, except, of course, Riemann sums are normally considered on a finite interval. Dealing within this kind of sum is a bit annoying, so let's focus on the left hand side of $(1)$ instead. Suppose there are constants $C$ and $p&gt;1$ such that<br>
$$
|f(x)|\le C|x|^{-p}

for large $x$. This isn't a super strong assumption; reasonable integrable functions tend to decay like that. 
As $\beta\to\infty$, we get
$$
\left| \sum_{k\ne 0} f(k\beta) \right| \le \beta^{-p}\sum_{k\ne 0}|k|^{-p} \to 0

<p>Of course, so does the right hand side since they are equal. At this point I'm inclined to cop out by saying: suppose also that $\hat f$ is integrable; then the Fourier inversion formula holds.
$$
f(0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,d\xi

$$\alpha \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(n\alpha)\to \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,d\xi\tag2$$
as $\alpha\to 0 $.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Proving $(2)$ directly seems awkward. 
If $f$ is integrable, then $\hat f$ is uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$. 
which tells us that $\alpha \hat f(n\alpha)$ is uniformly close to $\int_{n\alpha}^{(n+1)\alpha}\hat f(\xi)\,d\xi$. Unfortunately, a uniform bound isn't much good with infinitely many terms. We need something like 
$$\left|\alpha \hat f(n\alpha) - \int_{n\alpha}^{(n+1)\alpha}\hat f(\xi)\,d\xi\right| &lt; \frac{C(\alpha)}{n^p} \tag3$$
with $p&gt;1$, and $C(\alpha)\to 0$ as $\alpha\to 0$; this way the errors add up to a small quantity. By the mean value theorem the left hand side of $(3)$ is bounded by $\alpha^2 \sup_{[n\alpha, (n+1)\alpha]}|\hat f'|$ so if we have $|\hat f'|\le C/|x|^p$ for some $1&lt;p&lt;2$, then $(2)$ follows. This is a relatively strong assumption compared to the first part of this post.</p>

"2398670","2398674","<p>Taking the last two digits of a number is equivalent to taking the number $\bmod 100$.  You can write a large number as $100a+10b+c$ where $b$ and $c$ are the last two digits and $a$ is everything else.  Then $(100a+10b+c)^2=10000a^2+2000ab+200ac+100b^2+20bc+c^2$.  The first four terms all have a factor $100$ and cannot contribute to the last two digits of the square.  The term $20bc$ can only contribute an even number to the tens place, so cannot change the result.  To have the last digit of the square odd we must have $c$ odd.  We then only have to look at the squares of the odd digits to see if we can find one that squares to two odd digits.  If we check the five of them, none do and we are done.</p>

  <p>The original image of a basis for

Let $T$ act on both side, we have $\sum_{j\in\Gamma_2^0}k_j \beta_j=0$, thus $k_j=0(j\in \Gamma_2)$. Hence $\sum_{i\in\Gamma_1^0}k_i\e_i=0$ and $k_i=0(i\in\Gamma_1)$. Therefore, $\{\e_i\}_{i\in \Gamma_1}\cup\{\alpha_j\}_{j\in\Gamma_2}$ is linear independent.$\blacksquare$</p>

<p>As for rigor, there isn't much to say. I'll write it in steps :</p>

<p>1) To  show that $(0,1]$ is not complete under the absolute value metric, it is enough to find a Cauchy sequence in $(0,1]$ which does not converge in $(0,1]$.</p>

<p>2) Define $a_k = \frac 1k$ for all $k \in \mathbb N$. Clearly, $0 &lt; a_k \leq 1$ for all $k$, hence $\{ a_k\} \subset (0,1]$.</p>

<p>3) $|a_k - a_l|= |\frac 1k - \frac 1l| = |\frac{l-k}{kl}|$. Given $\epsilon &gt; 0$, choose $M$ so large that $\frac 1M &lt; \frac \epsilon 2$. Then, 
$$
l,k &gt; M \implies \left|\frac 1l - \frac 1k\right| \leq \left|\frac 1l\right| + \left|\frac 1k\right| &lt; 2\frac \epsilon 2 &lt; \epsilon
$$<br>
So the  sequence $\{a_k\}$ is Cauchy.</p>

<p>4) Note that  $|a_k - 0| = |a_k| = \frac 1k$ can be made less than $\epsilon &gt; 0$ by simply taking $k &gt; \frac 1 \epsilon$. Hence, $a_k \to 0$. However, $0 \notin (0,1]$, hence $\{a_k\}$ is a Cauchy sequence which is not convergent in $(0,1]$.</p>

"2399158","2399190","<p>In the double sum, if you take all the terms corresponding to $(x-\alpha)^ {-j}$ and $(x-\overline{\alpha})^{-j}$, then this partial sum  can be written
$$S = \frac{A(x)}{(x-\alpha)^n(x-\overline{\alpha})^n}$$
where $A$ is a polynomial of degree $&lt;2n$. You can divide $A(x)$ by $(x-\alpha)(x-\overline{\alpha})$,
$$A(x) = A_1(x)(x-\alpha)(x-\overline{\alpha}) + b_n x + c_n$$
so that
$$S = \frac{A_1(x)}{(x-\alpha)^{n-1}(x-\overline{\alpha})^{n-1}} + \frac{b_n x + c_n}{(x-\alpha)^n(x-\overline{\alpha})^n}$$

$$\overline{\left(\frac{f(\overline{x})}{g(\overline{x})}\right)}
= \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$$
Applying this to the complex decomposition yields
$$\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \sum\sum \frac{\overline{a_{i j}}}{x-\overline{\alpha_i}} + \overline{p(\overline{x})}$$
The uniqueness of the decomposition shows that $p$ has real coefficients and also that the quantity $S = S(x)$ above satisfies $\overline{S(\overline{x})} = S(x)$. It follows that
$$A(x) = S(x)(x-\alpha)^n(x-\overline{\alpha})^n$$

"
"2399212","2399258","<p>I assume you are looking for the probability of drawing the green marble exactly on the $Z$-th draw, right?</p>

<p>Well, if you think about this just intuitively, the chance of drawing the green ball on the 7th draw should be the same as drawing it on the 13th draw: the problem is equivalent to randomly distributing the marbles to $n$ different people; clearly everyone has a $\frac{1}{n}$ chance of getting the green  marble.</p>

<p>Indeed, note that the sum of all probabilities should add up to $1$, which is <em>not</em> the case with your calculations. In fact, for the last draw you have $Z=n$, and so by your formula you would have a probability of $\frac{1}{n-Z+1}=\frac{1}{n-n+1}=\frac{1}{1}=1$ of drawing the green marble on the last draw.... clearly not right! But if the chance is $\frac{1}{n}$, then clearly the probabilities do add up to $1$.</p>

<p>Ok, but why doesn't the order matter? If I hand out the marbles one by one, why wouldn't the 7th person not have some kind of advantage or disadvantage compared to the 13th person? How does the math work out so that everyone has exactly $\frac{1}{n}$ probability of getting the green marble?</p>

<p>Well, like you said, to get the marble on the first draw is $\frac{1}{n}$. But to get it on the second draw is to not get it on the first draw and then get it on the next draw. So that would $\frac{n-1}{n}\cdot \frac{1}{n-1}=\frac{1}{n}$.  Now you try to get the right formula for drawing the marble on the third draw ... and you'll see the general pattern.</p>

<p>BY the way, if you meant to find the probabilities of drawing the green marble in any of the first $Z$ draws, then that probability will be $\frac{Z}{n}$. Again, intuitively go back to distributing the marbles among $n$ people: what is the chance that among any $Z$ of them, one has the green marble? GIven that they each have a chance of $\frac{1}{n}$, and given that these are mutually exclusive, you can just add them all up, so you get $\frac{Z}{n}$.</p>

<p>OR, doing the 'one by one' math: the probability to get the green marble on either of the first two draws is 1 minus the probability of not getting it on either draw, so that would be $1-\frac{n-1}{n}\cdot \frac{n-2}{n-1}=1-\frac{n-2}{n}=\frac{2}{n}$.  Again, I'll leave it up to you to find the general expression for any $Z$, but note that your formula in your Post does also not match up with these probabiliies.</p>

"2399367","2399399","<p>+1 good question. This is a point of vagueness in a lot of heuristic descriptions of groups and symmetries. I think one confusing point is when you talk of rotation - do you mean it dynammicaly (here I'm rotating the square around, taking some time up to do so), or all at once (via the function that does the rotation).</p>

<p>The difference between the two is the difference between, one the one hand, a path in $SO_2(\mathbb{R})$ starting at the identity matrix and ending at a rotation matrix $M$, and, on the other hand, that rotation matrix $M$.</p>

<p>It's true that you can find paths of transformations in $SO(2)$ that bring the letter $R$ back to itself. However, these paths start and stop at the same point, namely the identity matrix.</p>

<p>When we talk about symmetries of subset $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, we generally interpret it the second way - as the subgroup $GL_2(\mathbb{R})$ (or the affine group if you are allowed translations) consisting of the  matrices that fix the set $S$ and preserve all distances. (The choice between linear and affine symmetries also reminds me to tell you that you generally need to specify the symmetries of your object as belonging to some subgroup of the group of bijections, depending on the properties you want those symmetries to preserve. When people talk about symmetries in Euclidean space, they typically have in mind isometries.)</p>

<p>(Note that here there are two possible choices - do we want matrices $M$ so that as sets $MS = S$ or do we want to require that for all $s \in S$, $Ms = s$. When we talk about the symmetries of physical shape in Euclidean space we generally mean the former. The latter is <em>much</em> more restrictive. However, there are situations when we mean the latter (pointwise) option. For example, automorphisms of a field extension of $E$ over $F$ are taken to mean (among other requirements) that they fix $F$ pointwise.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, $SO(2)$ is a circle, and the path you describe (besides being set theoretically non-trivial), is also homotpically non-trivial, and indeed generates the fundamental group of $SO(2)$, which is $\mathbb{Z}$.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the $^{\text{(fallacious)}}$ idea that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">correlation implies causation</a> is equivalent (by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraposition"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">contrapositive</a>) to the $^{\text{(also fallacious)}}$idea that a lack of causation implies a lack of correlation. </p>

<p>Perhaps the folks over at the <a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/"">English Language &amp; Usage Stack Exchange</a> can clarify the non-mathematical use of the word ""independent"" better than I can. </p>

<p>We know that for any two events, regardless of independence, the following is true:</p>

<p>$$P(T_1 \cap T_2) = P(T_1) P(T_2 \,|\, T_1)$$</p>

<p>Suppose, for contradiction, that $T_1$ and $T_2$ are statistically independent. By definition,  $$P(T_1 \cap T_2) = P(T_1)P(T_2) $$</p>

<p>In order for the first and second equations above to both be satisfied, it must be the case that $$P(T_2\,|\,T_1)=P(T_2)$$</p>

<p>This is a contradiction. If the first test is positive, the second test clearly must be more likely to also be positive. Therefore, $$P(T_2 \,|\, T_1) \neq P(T_2) \,\,\implies \,\,P(T_1 \cap T_2) \neq P(T_1)P(T_2) \,\, \implies \,\, T_1 \text{ and } T_2 \text{ are not independent }$$</p>

By proving $l = u$ that will prove that $l = u = r$ would be such a point but not that it is unique.  You can't assume wlog that $l &lt; u$.  You can prove that if $l &gt; u$ leads to a contradiction (as $u &lt; x &lt; l \implies x \not \in A \cup B$) and that $u &gt; 1$ leads to a contradiction ($l &lt; x &lt;u \implies \exists a\in A; b\in B: b &lt; x &lt; a$).

"2399791","2399801","<p>Hint:$$\lim_{n \to \infty}\sqrt[n]{2^n+3^n+5^n}=\\\lim_{n \to \infty}\sqrt[n]{5^n((\frac 25)^n+(\frac 35)^n+1)} \to 5$$You can facotr $max\{|x_i|\}$ in radical ,to proove what you need 
$$||\vec x||_\infty=\lim_{n \to \infty}\sqrt[n]{\sum_{i=1}^m|x_i|^n} $$take $max\{|x_i|\}=M$ so $M \geq \underbrace{|x_i|}_{i=1,2,3,...m}$
now
$$\lim_{n \to \infty}\sqrt[n]{\sum_{i=1}^m|x_i|^n}=\\\lim_{n \to \infty}\sqrt[n]{|x_1|^n+|x_2|^n+...+M^n+...+|X_m|^n}=\\
\lim_{n \to \infty}M\sqrt[n]{(\frac{|x_1|}{M})^n+(\frac{|x_2|}{M})^n+...+(\frac{M}{M})^n+...+(\frac{|x_m|}{M})^n}=\\
M\sqrt[n]{0+0+...+1+0+0+..}=\\M=max\{|x_i|\}$$</p>
