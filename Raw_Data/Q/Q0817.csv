I know it's roots are $\sigma_i(\alpha),$ but What is the proof to know that all the $\sigma_i's$ are different?</p>

<p>Proposition: If $\mathbf K:\mathbf F&lt;\infty,$ and is Galois, then it is normal and separable.</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong>
(summary of t.gunn's proof  :)</p>

<p>Let $\alpha\in\mathbf K.$</p>

<p>The minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ is</p>

<p>$$ f_\alpha(x) := \prod_{\beta \in G \cdot \alpha} (x - \beta). $$
Indeed:</p>

<p>First, note that $f_\alpha(\alpha) = 0$, which follows since $\alpha = \operatorname{id}(\alpha) \in G \cdot \alpha$.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Second, note that $f_\alpha \in \mathbf{F}[x]$, </p></li>
<li><p>Third note that $f_\alpha$ is minimal. Indeed if $f(\alpha) = 0$ then $f(\sigma(\alpha)) = \sigma(f(\alpha)) = \sigma(0) = 0$ for all $\sigma \in G$. Thus $\sigma(\alpha)$ is a root for all $\sigma \in G$. Thus $f_\alpha \mid f$.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, we note that $f_\alpha$ splits over $\mathbf{K}$ and is separable, by construction.</p>

"2376243","2376254","proof that a finite bounded set converges","<p>I'm having trouble understanding the part of the solution below which proves that every bounded sequence that's finite converges, which comes from theorom 3.8 (chapter title: ""numerical sequences and Series"") of ""Principles of Mathematical Analysis"" by rudin.  The theorem basically states that every bounded sequence contains a convergent subsequence.  </p>

<p>My interpetation is that $E$ is bounded but $\left\{s_n\right\}$ is not.  So we just assume that $\left\{s_n\right\}$ continues to take inputs.  Visually.  I see this as a parabola where $z$ is some point on one side of the maxima thus the subsequence includes the point on the other side which takes on the same value in the range?</p>

<p>btw, $E$ refers to the range of $\left\{s_n\right\}$</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If $E$ is finite, then then there is at least one point of $E$, say $z$, and a sequence $\left\{n_k\right\}$ where $n_1&lt;n_2&lt;...$, such that $s_{n_1}=s_{n_2}=...z$.  The subsquence $\left\{s_{n_k}\right\}$ obtained in this manner evidently converges</p>

  <li>$\vdash p\rightarrow(q\rightarrow p)$</li>
  <li>$\vdash(p\rightarrow(q\rightarrow r))\rightarrow((p\rightarrow q)\rightarrow(p\rightarrow r))$</li>
  <li>$\vdash(\neg p\rightarrow\neg q)\rightarrow(q\rightarrow p)$</li>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>$p,\space p\rightarrow q\vdash q$</li>
  </ul>

<p>Is this sufficient to characterize all of propositional logic? In other words, can every proof in propositional logic be reduced to combinations of solely these symbols and applications of purely these rules? I'm aware every formula can be reduced to combinations of $\neg$ and $\rightarrow$, or to define other logical connectives in terms of only these for ease of use, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>$p\land q:=\neg(p\rightarrow\neg q)$</li>
<li>$p\lor q:=\neg p\rightarrow q$</li>
</ul>

<p>Wikipedia gives a list of common rules of inference <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rules_of_inference#Rules_of_classical_predicate_calculus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, is it possible to do a similar thing and define all of these rules of inference using only the information given in the introduction, i.e. take, for instance, disjunctive syllogism:</p>

<p>$$\frac{p\lor q,\space\neg p}{\therefore q}$$</p>

<p>$$\frac{\neg p\rightarrow q,\space\neg p}{\therefore q}$$</p>

<p>And any other of the given rules on that page? If not, what is the minimal set of rules of inference? I ask this as a mental exercise, obviously it is not practical to reduce everything to this smallest sufficient set of rules, in the same way that we use $\land$, $\lor$, and $\leftrightarrow$ in addition to the other two for ease of use.</p>

<p>Also, if my understanding is right, we can take any two of the three axioms and turn them into rules of inference as long as we leave at least one element in our set of axioms, but please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

For instance if $G=C_2$ then the group matrix is given by:
$X_G = \begin{pmatrix}
x &amp; y\\ 
y &amp; x
\end{pmatrix}$. It has determinant $\det(X_G) = x^2-y^2$.
The question: For which natural numbers $n$ do we have $n = x^2-y^2$ is given by Fermat where he says that every odd number has such a presentation and this is used in Fermat factorization.</p>

<p>Now we want to make things a little more complicated and hopefully also more interesting:</p>

<p>Let $G$ be the Klein Four group. Then the group matrix of $G$ is given by:
$X_G=\begin{pmatrix}
 x_1&amp; x_2 &amp;x_3  &amp;x_4 \\ 
 x_2&amp;  x_1&amp; x_4 &amp; x_3\\ 
 x_3&amp;  x_4&amp; x_1 &amp; x_2\\

$ It has determinant $\det(X_G) = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4)\cdot(x_1 + x_2 - x_3 - x_4)\cdot(x_1 - x_2 + x_3 - x_4)\cdot(x_1 - x_2 - x_3 + x_4)$</p>

<p>If one asks the question:
For which natural numbers $n$ do we have $n=\det(X_G)$ then because of a theorem from Dedekind we have $nm=\det(X_G)\cdot\det(Y_G) = \det(X_G\cdot Y_G) = \det(Z_G)$ hence it is enough to ask for which primes $p$ do we have such a representation.</p>

<p>For $G=$ Klein four group and $p\equiv 1 \mod(4)$ we have a solution:
$x_1=x_2=x_3=\frac{p-1}{4}$, $x_4=\frac{p+3}{4}$ which might be verified with your favorite algebra system (I recommend SAGE).</p>

<p>Now my question is: Let $p \equiv 3 \mod(4)$ be a prime.
Is it true, that $\det(X_G) = p$ has no solutions in natural numbers? If so, how to prove it? (I have a straightforward idea on how one might prove this, but it would be interesting to compare different solutions to this problem).</p>

<p>My guess is that $G=\operatorname{Hol}(H)=H\rtimes \operatorname{Aut}(H)$. For example, let $H=\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2=\{1,x,y,xy\}$, then $\operatorname{Aut}(H)\cong S_3$, where each symmetry permutes the $3$ non-identity elements of $H$. $G=\operatorname{Hol}(H)=(\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2)\rtimes_\varphi S_3$:$$\varphi:S_3\rightarrow\operatorname{Aut}(\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2)\cong S_3$$$$\varphi(12)=\sigma_{(12)}:x\mapsto y,y\mapsto x,xy\mapsto xy$$$$\varphi(123)=\sigma_{(123)}:x\mapsto y,y\mapsto xy,xy\mapsto x$$$$\vdots$$</p>

<p>We kind of embed both $H$ and $\operatorname{Aut}(H)$ in a larger group, in this case $G=\operatorname{Hol}(H)\cong S_4$, and $H\unlhd G$. Every automorphism $\sigma$ of $H=\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2$ appears in the codomain of $\varphi$ and it corresponds to exactly one element in $S_3$ ($\varphi$ is a bijection). If we see $S_3$ as a subgroup of $S_4$, then $\sigma$ corresponds to $g=(1,\sigma)\in G$ s.t. conjugation by $g=(1,\sigma)$ when restricted to $H$ is $\sigma$, because this is exactly how we define a semidirect product: $K$ acts on $H$ by conjugation. e.g. $\sigma_{(12)}:x\mapsto y,y\mapsto x,xy\mapsto xy$ corresponds to the ordered pair $g=(1,(12))\in G$ s.t. conjugation by $g$ when restricted to $H$ (used during construction of the semidirect product) is $\sigma_{(12)}$.</p>

  <p>A sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$ is called a flasque sheaf if every restriction map $\mathcal{F}(U)\rightarrow \mathcal{F}(V)$ is a surjective map.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question is as follows : </p>

<p>If  $0\rightarrow \mathcal{F}'\xrightarrow{\psi} \mathcal{F}\xrightarrow{\varphi} \mathcal{F}''\rightarrow 0$ is an exact sequence of sheaves, and $\mathcal{F}'$ is a flasque sheaf, then, the sequence of abelian groups $0\rightarrow \mathcal{F}'(U)\xrightarrow{\psi(U)}\mathcal{F}(U)\xrightarrow{\varphi(U)} \mathcal{F}''(U)\rightarrow 0$ is exact. </p>

<p>Fix an open subset $U\subseteq X$. It suffices to prove that $\mathcal{F}(U)\xrightarrow{\varphi(U)} \mathcal{F}''(U)$ is surjective. Given $s\in \mathcal{F}''(U)$ there exists an open cover $\{V_i\}$ and $t_i\in \mathcal{F}(V_i)$ such that $\varphi(V_i)(t_i)=s|_{V_i}$ in the following commutative diagram<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kA6JD.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kA6JD.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I am trying to prove that these sections $t_i\in \mathcal{F}(V_i)$ glue together to give a section $t\in \mathcal{F}(U)$ i.e., $t|_{V_i}=t_i$. Then,
$$\varphi(U)(t)|_{V_i}=\varphi(V_i)(t|_{V_i})=\varphi(V_i)(t_i)=s|_{V_i}.$$
By identity axiom, we then conclude that $\varphi(U)(t)=s$.</p>

<p>I still have not used that $\mathcal{F}'$ is a flasque sheaf. I am confused what open sets should I consider whose restriction map is a surjective map. As we are talking about restrcition $t_i|_{V_i\cap V_j}$ of an element in $\mathcal{F}(V_i)$ I think surjectivity of restriction maps of these open sets 
$V_i,V_i\cap V_j, V_j$ gives some result.</p>

<p>We have </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/t5ccG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/t5ccG.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>To use that restriction maps corresponding to $\mathcal{F}'$ are surjective, we need to get an element in $\mathcal{F}'(V_i\cap V_j)$. Suppose $a\in \mathcal{F}(V_i\cap V_j)$ is such that $\varphi(V_i\cap V_j)(a)=0$ then $a=\psi(b)$ for some $b\in \mathcal{F}'(V_i\cap V_j)$.</p>

<p>We have 
$$\begin{align}\varphi(t_i|_{V_i\cap V_j}-t_j|_{V_i\cap V_j})
&amp;=\varphi(t_i|_{V_i\cap V_j})-\varphi(t_j|_{V_i\cap V_j})\\
&amp;=\varphi(V_i)(t_i)|_{V_i\cap V_j}-\varphi(V_j)(t_j)|_{V_i\cap V_j}\\
&amp;=(s|_{V_i})|_{V_i\cap V_j}-(s|_{V_j})|_{V_i\cap V_j}\\
&amp;=s|_{V_i\cap V_j}-s|_{V_i\cap V_j}=0\end{align}$$
So, $$t_i|_{V_i\cap V_j}-t_j|_{V_i\cap V_j}=\psi(a_{ij})$$ for some $a_{ij}\in \mathcal{F}'(V_i\cap V_j)$.
As restriction maps are surjective, there exists $b_i\in \mathcal{F}'(V_i)$
such that $b_i|_{V_i\cap V_j}=a_{ij}$ for all $i,j$.</p>

<p>Then $\psi (V_i)(b_i)\in \mathcal{F}(V_i)$. I do not think this way would lead me anywhere near the final step. </p>

<p>First, I have some questions regarding the notation and definitions in the question. What exactly does $T^n$ mean? I haven't seen this notation before and it is not explained in the question. Does it just mean the $n$-th composition of $T$ with itself? For example $T^2 = T \circ T$, $T^3 = T \circ T \circ T$, so $T^n = \underbrace{T \circ T \circ \cdots \circ T}_{n \text{ times}}$? Also what does $T+I$ mean? Is that just another linear transformation defined as $(T+I)(\mathbb{x}) = T(\mathbb{x}) + I(\mathbb{x})$ where $I(\mathbb{x})$ is the identity linear transformation on $\mathbb{R}^k$?</p>

<p>Now actually proving the question. I know that if $T$ was invertible then it is one-to-one and onto. So to show it is not invertible, we just need to show that it is not one-to-one or not onto (or both). Similarly, to show that $T+I$ is invertible, we must show it is one-to-one and onto. I am also given a hint that the inverse of $T+I$ is a polynomial function of $T$, but I have no idea of where that comes into play for the question. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I am having trouble seeing how this is true. Here is the best solution I could come up with. Let $A_p \in M_{m \times n}$ have its $p$-th column equal to $A$' $p$-th column, with zeros elsewhere, and let  $B_q$ be matrix whose $j$-th column is $B$'s $j$-th column, with zeros elsewhere. Clearly then $A = \sum A_p$ and $B = \sum B_q$. Then </p>

<p>$$AB = \sum_{p,q=1}^n A_p B_q$$</p>

<p>$$= \sum_{p=1}^n A_p B_p + \sum_{p \neq q}^n A_p B_q$$</p>

<p>I claim that $A_p B_q = 0$ if $p \neq q$. To see this, consider the $(i,j)$-th entry of $A_pB_q$:</p>

<p>$$(A_pB_q)_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n (A_p)_{ik}(B_q)_{kj}$$ </p>

<p>$$= (A_p)_{ip}(B_q)_{pj} + (A_p)_{iq}(B_q)_{qj} + \sum_{k \neq p,q}^n (A_p)_{ik}(B_q)_{kj}$$</p>

<p>Now, if neither $k=p$ nor $k=q$, then $(A_p)_{ik}=(B_q)_{kj}=0$, which means the sum on the LHS vanishes. When $k=p$, $(B_q)_{pj}=0$ since $B_q$ has zeros across every row, except possibly the $q$-th row; and a similar conclusion is drawn when $k=q$. Thus $(A_pB_q)_{ij}=0$. </p>

<hr>

<p>As I was typing this up, I made a crucial mistake: I thought that the $p$-th column of  $A_pB_P$ was equal to $AB$ and had zeros elsewhere. I tried this on specific $3 \times 3$ $A$ and $B$ and found that every entry of $A_1B_1$ was nonzero; I did find that the $1$-st and $3$-rd column of my example were multiples of each other. So, it may be possible to fix this proof, but I cannot see it. </p>

<p>In any case, these matrices $A_pB_p$ are clearly not necessarily rank $1$ matrices.

<p>I guess a starting point should be these formulas for the real and imaginary parts of the Riemann zeta function:</p>

<p>This gives:
$$\frac{1}{2} t \left(\log (\pi )-\psi ^{(0)}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)\right)$$

$$2.6860917096128327911 t$$
where $\psi ^{(0)}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)$ is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamma_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Polygamma</a> function.</p>

<p>Then I would compare it to the series expansion of:
$$\frac{\zeta \left(\frac{1}{2}+i t\right)-\zeta \left(\frac{1}{2}-i t\right)}{\frac{1}{2} (2 i) \left(\zeta \left(\frac{1}{2}+i t\right)+\zeta \left(\frac{1}{2}-i t\right)\right)}$$</p>

<p>I know that: $$\log (\pi )=\frac{\zeta '(0)}{\zeta (0)}-\log (2)$$ but that won't take me far will it?</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>I misread the Mathematica manual at first and missed that this is an equality:</p>

<p>Therefore the task is to show that:

<ol>
<li>Prove that AM-GM holds for two variables</li>
<li>Prove that if AM-GM holds for $k$ variables then it holds for $2k$ variables</li>
<li>Prove that if AM-GM holds for $k$ variables then it holds for $k-1$ variables</li>
</ol>

<p>If I prove all of these, I will have proved AM-GM. I have proved (1) and (2), but I am still struggling with (3). </p>

<p><strong>Proof for (1)</strong></p>

<p>By the Trivial Inequality, we know that the first statement is true. Therefore
\begin{align}
(a-b)^2 \ge 0 \implies\\
a^2-2ab+b^2 \ge 0 \implies \\
a^2+2ab+b^2 \ge 4ab  \implies\\
a+b \ge 2\sqrt{ab}  \implies\\
\frac{a+b}{2} \ge \sqrt{ab}\hspace{3mm}\blacksquare\\
\end{align}</p>

<p><strong>Proof for (2)</strong></p>

<p>Let our numbers be $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_{2k}$. Denote $$x = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{k}a_i}{k}, y = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=k+1}^{2k}a_i}{k}$$ 
We know that by AM-GM for 2 variables, that $$\frac{x+y}{2}\ge \sqrt{xy}$$
By our definition of $x, y$ this means that $$\frac{x+y}{2} = \frac{\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{2k}a_i}{k}}{2}=\frac{a_1+a_2+a_3+\ldots+a_{2k}}{2k}$$
Again by definition, $$\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{x_1+x_2+\ldots+x_k}{k}\right)\left(\frac{x_{k+1}+x_{k+2}+\ldots+x_{2k}}{k}\right)}$$ By AM-GM for $k$ variables, $$\sqrt{\left(\frac{x_1+x_2+\ldots+x_k}{k}\right)\left(\frac{x_{k+1}+x_{k+2}+\ldots+x_{2k}}{k}\right)} \ge \sqrt{\sqrt[k]{x_1x_2\ldots x_k}\sqrt[k]{x_{k+1}x_{k+2}\ldots x_{2k}}}$$ This is simply equal to $$\sqrt[2k]{x_1x_2x_3\ldots x_{2k}}\hspace{3mm}\blacksquare$$</p>

<p>However, I have no idea how to proceed on (3). I tried using the definition of AM and GM but did not come up with anything useful. Feel free to point out any errors or flaws on my proofs for (1) and (2).</p>

But how do we view those functors as modules then?
I would assume that this is done by considering the abelian group $F(R)$, where the scalar multiplication is defined by $R \to F(R), f \mapsto F(f)$, since $\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{A}(R,R) = R$. Does it work this way? Is there a good reference where this is spelled out? <br>
Also, which modules correspond to the representable presheaves? Clearly, $R_R$ should be one, but do I get more?

"2376928","2376976","What is the significance of the quotient $m/m^2$?","<p>This is a curious question as much as anything. In many situations in commutative algebra, $m$ and $m^2$ (or better, $m^k$ and $m^{k+1}$, with $k \geq 0$ an integer) occur together, where $m$ is a maximal ideal of a ring $R$, or $m$ is an $R$-module, where sometimes there are assumptions on the quotient $m/m^2$ or conditions on some ideal/module lying between the powers: $m^2 \subseteq I \subseteq m$.</p>

<p>I have always wondered what the significance of this is. What is the algebraic (or maybe geometric) intuition relating $m$ with $m^2$ (in either context)? For example, say that $R$ is local for simplicity. Then $K = R\otimes \frac{R}{m}$ is the residue field, and considering $K$ as an $R$-module, $K \otimes m = m/m^2$. If on the other hand $m$ is any $R$-module, other properties of $m/m^2$ become interesting. Do these examples hint at anything? Matsumura's Commutative algebra is riddled with quotients and powers of this form, but I have never gotten (or remembered) any explanation or intuition as to why the above situations arise so often.

<p>Is there a small error in part (a)?
Technically, a set $Y$ is in $D$ if and only if $Y$ extends $X_\phi$ for some $\mathcal{L}$-sentence $\phi$. So all $Y$ have some $X_\phi$ as a subset - where $X_\phi$ is the whole set of all finite theories containing $\phi$.
By my reasoning, then, every $Y \in D$ must, for some $\phi$, contain all finite theories $\Delta$ that contain $\phi$.</p>

<p>So, choose $A$ and $B$ in $D$; then for some $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$,
\begin{equation}
X_{\phi_1} \subset A \subset I
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
X_{\phi_2} \subset B \subset I
\end{equation}
So the intersection of $A$ and $B$ must contain $X_\psi$ for some $\psi$, but why is $A \cap B$ guaranteed to contain this, and what would $\psi$ be? I was thinking of $\psi = \phi_1 \land \phi_2$ because $A \cap B$ contains every finite theory that contains both $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, but just because a theory contains $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ doesn't mean it contains $\phi_1 \land \phi_2$, because there's nothing mentioned about taking logical completion and that doesn't make sense in this context. The proof on ProofWiki is slightly different than this one so I was wondering if this was a bug.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Theorem: Let $K:F$ be a extension and $A_F^K=\{\alpha\in K:\alpha$ is algebraic over $F\}$. Prove that if $K$ is algebraically closed, then $A_F^K$ is algebraically closed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Proof (Arturo Magidin):</strong></p>

<p>Let $A_F^K = \{ a\in K\mid a\text{ is algebraic over }F\}$, and let $f(x)\in A_F^K[x]$ be a non-constant polynomial. We may assume $f(x)$ is monic,
$$f(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0,\quad a_i\in F,\quad n\gt 0.$$
Since $a_i\in A_F^K$, then $a_i$ is algebraic over $F$ for all $i$, so the field $E=F(a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1})$ is a finite extension of $F$. </p>

<p>Now $f(x)\in A_F^K[x]\subseteq K[x]$, so we know that $K$ contains a root $r$ of $f(x)$, since $K$ is algebraically closed. Therefore, $[E(r):E] \leq n$ is finite, so $[E(r):F] = [E(r):E][E:F]$ is also finite. Therefore, $[F(r):F] \leq [E(r):F]$ is finite, so $r$ is algebraic over $F$. Since $r$ is algebraic over $F$, then $r\in A_F^K$. Thus, $f(x)$ has a root in $A_F^K$.</p>

<p>This shows that every non-constant polynomial in $A_F^K(x)$ has a root in $A_F^K.$</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why $E$ is a finite extension of $F?$, why $[E(r):E] \leq n$, why $[F(r):F] \leq [E(r):F]$, and why did he concluded that $r$ is algebraic over $F?$</p>

Answer: (a)<br>
\begin{eqnarray*}
P( y \le y_0 ) &amp;=&amp; P ( y \ge \frac{u_0}{3} ) = \int_{-1}^{\frac{u_0}{3}} \big( \frac{3}{2} \big)y^2 \, dy \\

f(u_1) &amp;=&amp; \frac{3u_1^2}{54} \\
f(u_1) &amp;=&amp; \frac{u_1^2}{18} \\
\end{eqnarray*}
Now, we need to find the limits for the function. When $y = -1$ then $u_1 = -3$. When $y = 1$ then $u_1 = 3$. Hence we have:<br>
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(u) = \begin{cases}
\big( \frac{u^2}{18} \big), &amp;\text{for} -3 \le u \le 3 \\

f(u_2) &amp;=&amp; \frac{3(3 - u_2)^2}{2} \\

Now, we need to find the limits for the function. When $y = -1$ then $u_2 = 4$. When $y = 1$ then $u_2 = 2$. Hence we have:<br>

f(u_3) &amp;=&amp; 3u_3^{ \frac{1}{2} } \\
\end{eqnarray*}
Now, we need to find the limits for the function. Observe that $u_3$ is always greater than or equal to $0$. Hence,
the lower bound for $u_3$ is $0$. When $y = 1$, $u_3 = 1$. Hence we have:<br>

<p>Now when I take $G=\mathbb{Z}/3$ and $A$ to be the trivial $G$ module $\mathbb{Z}/3$, this characterization says that $|H^2(\mathbb{Z/3},\mathbb{Z/3})|=|\mathbb{Z/3}|=3$ is the number of group extensions $ 0 \to \mathbb{Z/3} \to K \to \mathbb{Z/3} \to 0$.</p>

<p>The only subgroups of $\mathbb{Z/3} \oplus \mathbb{Z/3}$ of order $3$ are the ones generated by $(1,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$ and there are automorphisms of this group that permute the generators any way one likes.

<p>now in the normal direction $e_n$ it wouldn't make sense to se $p^n(0) = g_{x_n}(\mathbf x(0))$, rather he defines the $n$-th component of $\mathbf p(0)$ implicitly by $F(\mathbf p(0), z(0), \mathbf x(0)) = 0$, which means that the PDE is solved on the boundary point $\mathbf x(0)$.</p>

"2377194","2377705","Showing tensor product of reduced f.g $k$ algebra is reduced where I should assume $k$ algebraically closed.","<p>This is a rough idea I have to prove the statement of the following. I want to prove algebraically the product of varieties is variety where variety means irreducible algebraic set. </p>

<p>Let $A,B$ be f.g. reduced $k$ algebra and I should assume $k$ algebraically closed. Then $A\otimes B$ is reduced. </p>

<p>From Noether normalization, I obtain $k[x_1,\dots, x_n]\to A$ as integral extension and $k[y_1,\dots, y_m]\to B$ as integral extension. And Noether normalization does not require $k$ algebraically closed. So I obtained the following natural map. Denote $R_1=k[x_1,\dots, x_n],R_2=k[y_1,\dots, y_m]$.</p>

<p>$R=R_1\otimes R_2=k[x_1,\dots, x_n,y_1,\dots, y_m]\to A\otimes B$. It suffices to show any $0\neq a\otimes b\in A\otimes B$ is integral over $R$. Clearly $a\otimes 1$ integral over $R$ and $1\otimes b$ integral over $R$ as well. So $R\to R[a\otimes 1]\to R[a\otimes 1,1\otimes b]$ are the extensions and both extensions are finite. So I conclude that $a\otimes b$ is integral over $R$. So if I have $0\neq x,y\in A\otimes B$ and $xy=0$ say $x$ satisfies equation $f(z)=0$ and $y$ satisfies $g(z)=0$ where $f,g\in R[z]$ are monics. Choose $f,g$ containing constant term say $f_0,g_0\in R$. Then I check $f(x)g(y)=0$ by plugging in $x$ and $y$ values correspondingly. However $xy=0$ implies $f_0g_0=0$. Since $R=k[x_1,\dots, x_n,y_1,\dots, y_n]$ is integral domain, I conclude that $g_0=0$ or $f_0=0$ which is contradiction. So $xy\neq 0$ for any $0\neq x,y\in R$.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I also stumbled upon a paper 'Haar Measures on Hopf $C^*$-Algebras' by Quan (I don't know if enclosing the link would be legal). The idea of using Markov-Kakutani fixed point theorem is really breathtaking (in my opinion), but still, the author needs to assume that the compact quantum group is cocommutative. I would also like to avoid this restriction.</p>

<p>My attempt: To be explicit, denote $+_{V}: V \times V \rightarrow V$ and $\cdot_{V}: \mathbb{Q} \times V \rightarrow V$ as the vector addition and scalar multiplication in the vector space $V$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and similarly, denote $+_{W}: W \times W \rightarrow W$ and $\cdot_{W}: \mathbb{Q} \times W \rightarrow W$ as the vector addition and scalar multiplication in the vector space $W$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Let $T: V \rightarrow W$ be any additive function.

I am not very familiar with differential equations but know enough to observe that the solution in Eq. 5 seems to involve one.  Could someone please explain how the result in Eq. 5 is determined?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>

<p>Let,
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[X^{-1}]
=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{x}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right)\,\mathrm{d}x\,.
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Substitute $y=x/\sigma$ and introduce $a=\mu/\sigma$ to give
\begin{equation}
\tag{1}
\mathbb{E}[X^{-1}]
=\frac{1}{\sigma}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{y\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\tfrac{1}{2}(y-a)^{2}\right)\,\mathrm{d}y\,.
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Define $I(a)$ to be
\begin{equation}
\tag{2}
I(a)
=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{y\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\tfrac{1}{2}(y-a)^{2}\right)\,\mathrm{d}y\,.
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Then
\begin{equation}
\tag{3}
\exp\left(\tfrac{1}{2}a^{2}\right)\,I(a)
=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{y\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\tfrac{1}{2}y^{2}+ay\right)\,\mathrm{d}y\,,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{align}
\tag{4}
\frac{\partial}{\partial a}\left[\exp\left(\tfrac{1}{2}a^{2}\right)\,I(a)\right]
&amp;=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\tfrac{1}{2}y^{2}+ay\right)\,\mathrm{d}y\\
&amp;= \exp\left(\tfrac{1}{2}a^{2}\right)\,.
\end{align}</p>

<p>Thus
\begin{equation}
\tag{5}
\exp\left(\tfrac{1}{2}a^{2}\right)\,I(a)
=\int_{0}^{a}\exp\left(\tfrac{1}{2}t^{2}\right)\,\mathrm{d}t\,,
\end{equation}
the limits being determined by the fact that $I(a)=0$ when $a=0$. Therefore
\begin{equation}
\tag{6}
I(a)
=\exp\left(-\tfrac{1}{2}a^{2}\right)\int_{0}^{a}\exp\left(\tfrac{1}{2}t^{2}\right)\,\mathrm{d}t\,,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{align}
\tag{7}
\mathbb{E}[X^{-1}]
&amp;=\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}\exp\left(-\frac{\mu^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right)\int_{0}^{\mu}\exp\left(\frac{t^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right)\,\mathrm{d}t\,,\\
&amp;=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sigma}\,\mathcal{D}_{+}\left(\frac{\mu}{\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right)\,.
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{D}_{+}(z)$
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}_{+}(z)=
e^{-z^{2}}\int _{0}^{z}e^{t^{2}}\,\mathrm{d}t\,,

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wMA7t.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Above, $\frac{g(b) - g(a)}{b-a} =1.1751$. Mean Value Theorem gives us $C_2=0.1613$. Clearly, $C_1\neq C_2$. The equation in general can be written as, $$\frac{f'(C_1)}{g'(C_2)} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{g(b) - g(a)} \neq \frac{f'(C_1)}{g'(C_1)}(or) \frac{f'(C_2)}{g'(C_2)} $$ </p>

<p>The proof of L'Hospital's rule was worked out using the equation $\frac{f'(C)}{g'(C)} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{g(b) - g(a)}$. It does not convince me to a good extent. Am I missing a point here, thereby complicating the work? </p>

<hr>

<p>I went ahead and tried approaching the proof of L'Hospital's rule in a different way. If the below proof is right, then I'm quite sure that it is not a new way of approach. </p>

<p>Given, functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are continuous and differentiable in an interval containing a point $a$. The two functions take zero values at $a$, say. We have, $\lim_{x\rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$. This limit, at first look, takes an indeterminate form $\frac{0}{0}$. An indeterminate form can take any value( or no value ). We can write, $$\lim_{x\rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)h}{g(x)h}$$ Where $h\neq0$. Further we can write, $$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{(f(a+h)-f(a-h))2h}{(g(a+h)-g(a-h))2h}$$ Where once again the limit takes the same indeterminate form. Mean Value Theorem gives us, $$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f'(C_1)}{g'(C_2)}$$</p>

<p>As $h$ gets close to zero, $C_1$ and $C_2$ get close to $a$. We can then write, $\lim_{x\rightarrow a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}= \lim_{x\rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$. Here, we assume that $g'(x) \neq 0$.</p>

<p>Could there be any flaw in this approach? </p>

"2377674","2377817","The first derivative of a product of two polynomials","<p>Consider the differentiation of functions which are a product of two polynomials, such as $y = (x^2-1)(x+1)$</p>

<p>Let <em>u</em> = $x^2-1$, and <em>v</em> = $x+1$</p>

<p>Then, $y=uv$ ........................<strong>(1)</strong></p>

<p>where <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> are both functions of <em>x</em></p>

<p>From the first principles of differentiation:</p>

<p>$y+{\partial y} = (u + {\partial u})(v +{\partial v})$</p>

<p>= $uv + u{\partial v} + v{\partial u} + {\partial u}{\partial v}$ ........................<strong>(2)</strong></p>

<p><strong>(2)-(1)</strong>:</p>

<p>${\partial y} = u{\partial v} + v{\partial u} + {\partial u}{\partial v}$ ........................<strong>(3)</strong></p>

<p>Divide <strong>(3)</strong> by ${\partial x}$:</p>

<h1>$\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$ = $u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac {\partial u \partial v}{\partial x}$</h1>

<p>Take the limits on both sides:</p>

<h1>$\lim_{\partial x\to 0} \frac {\partial y}{\partial x} = u \lim_{\partial x\to 0} \frac {\partial v}{\partial x} + v \lim_{\partial x\to 0} \frac {\partial u}{\partial x} + \lim_{\partial x\to 0} \frac {\partial u}{\partial x} {\partial v} $</h1>

<p>As ${\partial x\to 0}$, ${\partial v}$ in general also tend to zero.</p>

<h1>$\lim_{\partial x\to 0} \frac {\partial y}{\partial x} = u \lim_{\partial x\to 0} \frac {\partial v}{\partial x} + v \lim_{\partial x\to 0} \frac {\partial u}{\partial x} + \lim_{\partial x\to 0} \frac {\partial u}{\partial x} (0)$</h1>

<h1>$\lim_{\partial x\to 0} \frac {\partial y}{\partial x} = u \lim_{\partial x\to 0} \frac {\partial v}{\partial x} + v \lim_{\partial x\to 0} \frac {\partial u}{\partial x}$</h1>

<h1>Since $\lim_{\partial x\to 0} \frac {\partial y}{\partial x} = \frac {dy}{dx}$, hence, $\frac {\partial v}{\partial x}\to \frac {dv}{dx} and \frac {\partial u}{\partial x}\to \frac {du}{dx}$</h1>

<p>Generally, </p>

<h1><strong>$$ \frac {d}{dx} (uv) = u \frac {dv}{dx} + v \frac {du}{dx}$$</strong></h1>

<p>This is known as the <strong>product rule</strong> for differentiation.</p>

<p>Everything that I wrote up there is the exact copy of what is written on my school textbook.</p>

<p>My question here is, when it said </p>

<h2>""As ${\partial x\to 0}$, ${\partial v}$ in general also tend to zero"",</h2>

<p>how come <strong>only</strong> the <strong>$\lim_{\partial x\to 0} \frac {\partial u}{\partial x} {\partial v} $</strong> is affected, making it <strong>$\lim_{\partial x\to 0} \frac {\partial u}{\partial x} (0)$?</strong> How come the <strong>$u \lim_{\partial x\to 0} \frac {\partial v}{\partial x}$</strong> is not affected too, since it also has the value $\partial v$</p>

<p>Although I know how to use the equation in questions, I'm just curious on how they derive the formula. I am aware that the other way of solving this question would be by expanding the function and finding its $ \frac {dy}{dx}$ from there.</p>

<p>I've also tried to look for other sources but non of them seem to really answer my question. My older brother told me it's unnecessary that I understand the whole process behind it since I'm still in high school and that I only need to know how to correctly apply the formula when solving questions. He did say that if I do insist on understanding it in depth then that's for when I do a Master's degree? I hope by posting this question I don't confuse myself even more.</p>

<hr>

<p>Given an integer $n$ there are $\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil-1$ perfect squares less than $n$, so there are $\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil-1$ numbers $n-m^2$ that all must be prime powers in order to be an exception.

Thus, the probability of $n-m^2$ to be a prime power is 
$\frac{1}{\ln (n-m^2)}$ and the probability $P_n$ for n to be an exception is: 
$$P_n=\prod_{m=1}^{\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil-1}\Big(\frac{1}{\ln (n-m^2)}\Big)$$</p>

  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The authors provide us with some hints. So I may as well incorporate them in the following attempt:</p>

<p><strong>We proceed with induction on $|P|$.</strong> The cases are trivial for $|P|=p$ or $p^2$. <br>If $|P|=p^3$, $P\cong\Bbb Z_{p^2}\times\Bbb Z_p,$ or $\cong\Bbb Z_p\times\Bbb Z_p\times\Bbb Z_p$, or $\cong\Bbb Z_{p^2}\rtimes\Bbb Z_p$, or $\cong(\Bbb Z_p\times\Bbb Z_p)\rtimes\Bbb Z_p$.<br>For an abelian group, every subgroup is normal. Both $\Bbb Z_{p^2}\times\Bbb Z_p$ and $\Bbb Z_p\times\Bbb Z_p\times\Bbb Z_p$ obviously contain such subgroup $U$.</p>

<p>If $P\cong(\Bbb Z_p\times\Bbb Z_p)\rtimes\Bbb Z_p=\langle a,b,c$ s.t. $a^p=b^p=c^p=1,ab=ba,cac^{-1}=ab,cbc^{-1}=b\rangle$, take $U=\langle a,b\rangle$.</p>

<p>If $P\cong\Bbb Z_{p^2}\rtimes\Bbb Z_p=\langle d,e$ s.t. $d^{p^2}=e^p=1,ede^{-1}=d^{1+p}\rangle$, take $U=\langle d^p,e\rangle$. $d^p$ and $e$ commute because $ed^pe^{-1}=(ede^{-1})^p=(d^{1+p})^p=d^{p+p^2}=d^p$.</p>

<p><strong>Now we <em>really</em> actually proceed with induction.</strong> But before that, notice that the result is true if $P$ is an abelian group: every subgroup is normal and it's non-cyclic so it contains two elementary divisors anyway. Write $P\cong\Bbb Z_{p^{\beta_1}}\times\Bbb Z_{p^{\beta_2}}\times\dots$. Find an element of order $p$ in the first factor and another in the second factor, they generate the $U$ we want.</p>

<p>Now the inductive hypothesis: suppose the result is true for any group with order $&lt;|P|=p^\alpha$. Let $Z\le Z(P)$ with $|Z|=p$. Then we use this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lemma. if $P/Z$ is cyclic, then $P$ is abelian.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Assume $P/Z$ is not cyclic. $|P/Z|&lt;|P|$. Being a quotient of a $p$-group $P$, $P/Z$ is a $p$-group. By the inductive hypothesis, $P/Z$ contains a normal subgroup $H/Z\cong\Bbb Z_p\times\Bbb Z_p$. Let $\pi:P\rightarrow P/Z$ defined by $\pi:p\mapsto pZ$ be the natural projection homomorphism of the quotient. $\pi^{-1}(H/Z)=H$, the complete preimage of $H/Z$, is of order $p^3$.</p>

<p>Let $kerf=\{h\in H$ s.t. $h^p=1\}$ be the kernel of the following $p$-th power map. I also show some established results:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $p$ be an odd prime. $|H|=p^3$, the $p$-th power map of $H$, $f$, is defined as $f:h\mapsto h^p$. This is a homomorphism of $H$ into $Z(H)$. If $H$ is not cyclic, $|kerf|=p^2$ or $p^3$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>$H$ is not cyclic, because its quotient $H/Z$ is not cyclic. Also, $kerf\unlhd^{char}H$. This is because $kerf$ contains the identity and all the elements of $H$ that are of order $p$, and if $\sigma\in\operatorname{Aut}(H)$, $\sigma$ preserves orders of elements, so it permutes the elements of order $p$. So $\sigma(kerf)=kerf$.</p>

<p>We have $kerf\unlhd^{char}H\unlhd P$, i.e. $kerf\unlhd P$. And $kerf\cong\Bbb Z_p\times\Bbb Z_p$ (if so, then we're done), or $\cong\Bbb Z_p\times\Bbb Z_p\times\Bbb Z_p$, or $(\Bbb Z_p\times\Bbb Z_p)\rtimes\Bbb Z_p$.</p>

<hr>

<p>What if $kerf\cong\Bbb Z_p\times\Bbb Z_p\times\Bbb Z_p$, or $(\Bbb Z_p\times\Bbb Z_p)\rtimes\Bbb Z_p$? Surely for the former one, I cannot find characteristic subgroups of order $p^2$. There has to be some other way of constructing normal subgroup... For the latter one, is $\langle a,b\rangle$ characteristic? Why if it is?</p>

<p>Here is my proof:</p>

<p>Since $f$ is continuous, for any given value of $\epsilon\gt 0$, there exists $\delta\gt 0$ such that
$$|a-b|\lt \delta\implies|f(a)-f(b)|\lt \epsilon$$
I will use $\delta[\epsilon]$ to represent such a value of $\delta$.</p>

<p>Now suppose that $\epsilon'\gt 0$ is given. Let
$$\delta'=\delta\bigg[\frac{\epsilon'}{\sqrt n}\bigg]$$

$$\sum_{k=1}^n (a_k-b_k)^2\lt \delta'^2$$
and, for each $k$,
$$(a_k-b_k)^2\lt \delta'^2$$
$$|a_k-b_k|\lt \delta'$$
$$|a_k-b_k|\lt \delta\bigg[\frac{\epsilon'}{\sqrt n}\bigg]$$
and, by the way we defined $\delta[\epsilon']$, this implies
$$|f(a_k)-f(b_k)|\lt \frac{\epsilon'}{\sqrt n}$$
$$n(f(a_k)-f(b_k))^2\lt \epsilon'^2$$
$$(f(a_k)-f(b_k))^2+(f(a_k)-f(b_k))^2+...+(f(a_k)-f(b_k))^2\lt \epsilon'^2$$
where the LHS of the above statement contains $n$ copies of $(f(a_k)-f(b_k))^2$. Since this is true for all $k$, even the $k$ for which $(f(a_k)-f(b_k))^2$ is maximized, we have that
$$(f(a_1)-f(b_1))^2+(f(a_2)-f(b_2))^2+...+(f(a_n)-f(b_n))^2\lt \epsilon'^2$$
$$\sum_{k=1}^n (f(a_k)-f(b_k))^2\lt \epsilon'^2$$
$$\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^n (f(a_k)-f(b_k))^2}\lt \epsilon'$$

<p>In Godsil and Royle's <em>Algebraic Graph Theory</em>, they prove that any two distinct edge atoms of a graph $X$ are vertex-disjoint, making the following argument, where $A$ and $B$ are such edge atoms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So we may assume that $A\cup B$ is a proper subset of $V(X)$. Now, the previous lemma yields </p>
  
  <p>$$|\partial(A\cup B)| + |\partial(A\cap B)|\le 2\kappa_1(X),$$</p>
  
  <p>and, since $A\cup B\ne V(X)$ and $A\cap B\ne\emptyset$, this implies that </p>
  
  <p>$$|\partial(A\cup B)| = |\partial(A\cap B)| = \kappa_1(X).$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't understand why the second assertion is true, nor why it follows from  $A\cup B\ne V(X)$ and $A\cap B\ne\emptyset$. </p>

<li><p>For $S\subseteq V(X)$, we define $\partial S$ to be $\{xy\in E(X):x\in S, y\notin S\}$. That is, it is the set of edges with one end in $S$ and one end not in $S$;</p></li>
<li><p>An edge atom of $X$ is a subset $S\subseteq V(X)$ such that $|\partial S|=\kappa_1(X)$, and $|S|$ is minimal.</p></li>

<p>Am I wrong? If yes, where did I go wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Added Later</strong>  </p>

<p>After going through comments and thinking more, it seems that I am struggling to apply law of total probability (and my above solution is very well wrong). The basic form of law of total probability, which I came across till now, is as follows: 
$$P(A)=P(A|\color{red}{B})P(\color{red}{B})+P(A|\color{magenta}{B^c})P(\color{magenta}{B^c})$$
I am first time facing application of this law for conditional probability, as done book solution:
$$P(A_2|A_1)=P(A_2|AA_1)P(A|A_1)+P(A_2|A^cA_1)P(A_c|A_1)$$ 
as it involves three events ($A,A_1,A_2$). Book did not explained this. Though in current problem, it looks ""somewhat"" intuitive, </p>

<ol>
<li><p>can someone generalize it, so as to make my understanding more clear? Say for $n$ events? </p></li>
<li><p>Also, in $P(A_2|A_1)=P(A_2|\color{red}{AA_1})P(\color{red}{A|A_1})+P(A_2|\color{magenta}{A^cA_1})P(\color{magenta}{A^c|A_1})$, I feel red colored stuff should be same and pink colored stuff should be same, as in case of simple form law of total probability. </p></li>
<li><p>I felt it should be $P(A_2|\color{red}{(A_1|A)})P(\color{red}{A_1|A})+P(A_2|\color{magenta}{(A_1|A^c)})P(\color{magenta}{A_1|A^c})$. Am I absolutely stupid here? </p></li>

<p>I want to reverse the string, so that 12345 becomes 54321. This reversal can be thought of as a permutation $\sigma$ of the characters in the string.</p>

<p>What I would like to know is, <em>what is the parity of the reversal permutation, given as a function of the string length (the number of elements)?</em></p>

<p>For example, for $n= 1, 2, 3, 4$, the reversal parities are even, odd, odd, even respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Partial work:</strong> Equivalently, we just need to know the value of the function $f(n) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \mod 2$, since the number of elementary permutations in a reversal can just be counted as an arithmetic series (e.g. for '1234', '4' gets moved to the left three times, '3' two times, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> From <em>Geometric algebra for Physicists</em>, Chapter 2. There's an operator called 'reversion' defined in the text that reverses the elements of a wedge product. Since the wedge product is anti-commutative, the sign of the result is given by the parity of the permutation.</p>

Comments on my solution and possible causes for the discrepancies would be the most appreciated. I remark that I follow Folland's Introduction to Partial Differential Equations in the nomenclature and notations.</p>

<p>Problem: </p>

<p>Given an open set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ and $\phi(x) \in C^1(\Omega)$, solve:</p>

   u(x, 0) = \phi(x)$</p>

<p>My solution:</p>

<p>Since we have a linear first-order problem, the method of characteristics is the natural alternative. 
At first, we shall note that the hipersurface $S$ in which the initial conditions are given is $S = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}; y = 0 \}$, and that the characteristic variety is ${\rm char} = \{ (\xi_x, \xi_t) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{0\}; \xi_t = -x\xi_x \}$, so that the normal unit vector to $S$, namely $(0, 1)$, is not in $\rm char$, and hence we can proceed to integrate the vector field of the coefficients to find the (unique) solution to the problem (according to theorem 1.7 in Folland's book).</p>

<p>The associated system of ODEs is the following:</p>

<p>$\frac{dt}{d\alpha} = 1 \\
\frac{dx}{d\alpha} = x \\
\frac{du}{d\alpha} = t^3 \\
(x, t, u)|_{\alpha = 0} = (s,0,\phi(x)) $</p>

<p>being $(s, 0)$ the initial point in $S$ and $\alpha$ a parameter.</p>

<p>Solving the ODEs, we get:</p>

<p>$t(\alpha) = \alpha \\
x(\alpha) = se^\alpha \\
u(\alpha) = \frac{\alpha^4}{4} + \phi(s) $</p>

<p>At last, eliminating $\alpha$ and $s$, we get:</p>

<p>$u(x, t) = \frac{t^4}{4} + \phi(\frac{x}{e^t})$</p>

<p>We note that applying the operator $L = \partial_t + x\partial_x$ to the $u$ found above, we get $t^3$, as expected. However, Wolfram Mathematica gives the following: <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jNRT9.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mathematica inputs and solution</a>.</p>

In the second tetrahedron the sides of the base can be calculated, since we know the angle of each triangle being $60$ degrees and the two sides (proportions of $x$). Then we can calculate the area by Heron's formula. But how do we calculate the height of the new tetrahedron?

<p>$$\lim\limits_{x\to 1/2-}y(x)\;\; and\;\; \lim\limits_{x\to 1/2-}y'(x).$$</p>

<p>Here is my solution.</p>

<p>At the first step, we have </p>

<p>$$\frac{1-y^{2}}{y^{2}}dy=dx\;\Rightarrow\; 1/y+y=-x-c.$$</p>

<p>Since 
$y(0)=1/2\;$
so
$\;c=-5/2.$</p>

<p>Now, we put 
$x=1/2\;$ and $\;c=-5/2\;$
then we have 
$y=1$
by the 
$y+1/y=-1/2+5/2.$</p>

<p>Since 
$f(x,y)=\frac{1}{y}+y+x-\frac{5}{2}=0$
is continuous at every point except 
$y\neq 0.$
We have 
$\lim\limits_{x\to 1/2-}y(x)=1.$</p>

<p>Since we have 
$y'(x)=\frac{(y(x))^{2}}{1-(y(x))^{2}},$
therefore,

<p>Edit after comments:</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{y}+y+x-\frac{5}{2}=0 \Rightarrow y^{2}+(x-5/2)y+1=0 $$
$$\Rightarrow y=\dfrac{-(x-5/2)\pm\sqrt{(x-5/2)^{2}-4}}{2} $$
$$\Rightarrow \lim\limits_{x\to 1/2-}y(x)=1 $$

This gives us tools to split and reunite the spheres (let's say, by switching on a force in an outside shell that attracts or repulse the sphere rays radially). Is it mathematically consistent a world in which the Banach-Tarski theorem is true, but the mass is conserved?, so that when the spheres are split the mass also splits (and is well defined) and when the spheres are reunited in a different configuration this mass is still conserved (if we now have two spheres the density would be half of the original). That is, can I consistently define mass independently of volume, so that even if we do not have a volume we can still have a mass?   </p>

"2378122","2378159","If $\mu$ is a probability measure on $\mathbb R$, is $t\mapsto\mu\{t\}$ differentiable almost everywhere?","<p>In <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2372503/let-gx-be-analytic-on-every-interval-that-does-not-contain-0-is-ft-eg"">this question</a>, the OP at one point says that since $t\mapsto P[X=t]$ is zero almost everywhere, it is almost everywhere differentiable. I pointed out that this need not be the case - $\mathbf1_{\mathbb Q}$ is the usual example of a function which is zero almost everywhere but continuous nowhere - but I realized the situation is a little more subtle in this case.</p>

<p>If $\mu$ is a probability measure on $\mathbb R$, then for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, $\mu\{t\}\ge\varepsilon$ for at most finitely many $t$. In particular, $\lim_{s\to t}\mu\{s\}=0$ for all $t\in\mathbb R$, so $t\mapsto\mu\{t\}$ is continuous at every point of continuity of $\mu$. (Recall that <em>point of continuity</em> refers to the function $t\mapsto\mu((-\infty,t])$, so this statement isn't as meaningless as it appears.) Since there can be at most countably many atoms, this shows that at the very least we <em>do</em> have a.e. continuity.</p>

<p>What about differentiability? This is a messier question. Obviously the function is not differentiable at any atom. If the derivative exists at $t_0$, then it must equal zero. We therefore have that differentiability at $t_0$ is equivalent to</p>

<p>$$\mu\{t_0+h\}=o(h)\qquad\text{as }h\to0.\qquad\qquad(\dagger)$$</p>

<p>Does $(\dagger)$ occur for almost every $t_0$? I don't know. I also don't know how one would prove it if they did know, either.  I had an idea for a proof of the affirmative statement, trying to prove that the set of $t$ where $\mu\{t\}=0$ but $(\dagger)$ fails is at most countable, but it didn't pan out. A counterexample would surely be messy and hard to visualize - it would need to have a countable set of atoms whose closure had nonempty interior at a minimum.</p>

<p>If the answer turns out to be negative, how badly behaved can the function be? Can the set $\{t:s\mapsto\mu\{s\}\text{ is differentiable at }t\}$ have zero measure?</p>

<p>In this case, however, I need to prove that if $f \in F[x]$ (where $F$ is a field) is a non-constant polynomial, and $q \in F(x)$ is a non-constant rational function (so $q \notin F$), then $f(q)$, which is what I get if I substitute the rational function $q$ in for $x$ whenever it appears in the expression for $f$, is a non-constant rational function.</p>

<p>This is what I did:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose that $f \in F[x]$ is a non-constant polynomial, so that $f(x):=\lambda_{n}x^{n} + \lambda_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + \lambda_{0}$ for $\lambda_{n} \neq 0$.</p>
  
  <p>Suppose also that $q \in F(x)$ is a non-constant rational function, so that $\displaystyle q(x) = \frac{g(x)}{h(x)}$ where $g(x)$, $h(x)$ are $\in F[x]$, and $\gcd(g,h) = 1$. Say that $g(x):=\mu_{m}x^{m}+\mu_{m-1}x^{m-1}+\cdots + \mu_{0}$ and $h(x):=\nu_{k}x^{k}+\nu_{k-1}x^{k-1}+\cdots + \nu_{0}$, $h(x) \neq 0$.</p>
  
  <p>Then, $\displaystyle f(q(x)) = f \left(\frac{g(x)}{h(x)} \right) = \lambda_{n}\left( \frac{g(x)}{h(x)}\right)^{n} + \lambda_{n-1}\left(\frac{g(x)}{h(x)} \right)^{n-1}+ \cdots + \lambda_{0}$.</p>
  
  <p>Now, we have three cases:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose $\mu_{m} \neq 0$ but $\nu_{k} = 0$. Since $h(x) \neq 0$, we have at least that $h(x)$ is a constant polynomial, but since $\gcd(g,h) = 1$, $h$ is not a constant that divides all the coefficients of $g$.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Then, the highest order term (<strong>this true?</strong>) is $$ \lambda_{n}\mu_{m}^{n}\nu_{0}^{-n}x^{mn} = \lambda_{n} \left(\frac{\mu_{m}}{\nu_{0}} \right)^{n}x^{mn} $$ And $\lambda_{n}\left(\frac{\mu_{m}}{\nu_{0}} \right)^{n} \neq 0$, so $f(q)$ is a non-constant rational function. </p>
  
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li><strong>Case 2:</strong> Suppose $\mu_{m}=0$ but $\nu_{k} \neq 0$. Since $q$ must be non-constant, $g(x) \neq 0$. Further, since $g(x) \neq 0$, we have at least that $g(x) $ is a (nonzero) constant polynomial but since $\gcd(g,h) = 1$, $g$ is not a constant that divides all the coefficients of $g$.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Then, we have that $$f(q) = f\left( \frac{g}{h}\right) = \lambda_{n} \left( \frac{\mu_{0}}{\nu_{k}x^{k} + \cdots + \nu_{0}} \right)^{n} + \lambda_{n-1} \left(\frac{\mu_{0}}{\nu_{k}x^{k}+ \cdots + \nu_{0}} \right)^{n-1} + \cdots + \lambda_{0}  = \lambda_{n}\mu_{0}^{n}(\nu_{k}x^{k}+\cdots \nu_{0})^{-n} + \lambda_{n-1}\mu_{0}^{n-1} (\nu_{k}x^{k}+\cdots \nu_{0})^{-(n+1)} + \cdots + \lambda_{1}\mu_{0}(\nu_{k}x^{k}+\cdots \nu_{0})^{-1}+\lambda_{0}$$</p>
  
  <p>And (<strong>this true?</strong>) from the $\lambda_{1}\mu_{0}(\nu_{k}x^{k}+\cdots \nu_{0})^{-1} = \frac{\lambda_{1}\mu_{0}}{\nu_{k}x^{k}+\cdots + \nu_{0}}$ term, we see that $f(q)$ is not constant. So, $f(q)$ is a non-constant rational function.</p>
  
  <ol start=""3"">
  <li><strong>Case 3:</strong> Suppose $\mu_{m} \neq 0$ and $\nu_{k} \neq 0$. Then $$f(q) = \left( \frac{g}{h}\right) = \lambda_{n} \left(\frac{\mu_{m}x^{m} + \mu_{m-1}x^{m-1} + \cdots + \mu_{0}}{\nu_{k}x^{k}+\nu_{k-1}x^{k-1}+ \cdots + \nu_{0}} \right)^{n} + \lambda_{n-1} \left(\frac{\mu_{m}x^{m} + \mu_{m-1}x^{m-1} + \cdots + \mu_{0}}{\nu_{k}x^{k}+\nu_{k-1}x^{k-1}+ \cdots + \nu_{0}} \right)^{n-1} + \cdots + \lambda_{1} \left(\frac{\mu_{m}x^{m} + \mu_{m-1}x^{m-1} + \cdots + \mu_{0}}{\nu_{k}x^{k}+\nu_{k-1}x^{k-1}+ \cdots + \nu_{0}} \right) + \lambda_{0} $$</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><strong>Now, my thoughts were to look at the $\mu_{n}$ term above, which includes $\displaystyle \frac{\lambda_{n}\mu_{m}^{n}x^{mn}}{(\nu_{k}x^{k}+\nu_{k-1}x^{k-1}+ \cdots + \nu_{0})^{n}}$, and to use this somehow to show that since one of the terms with variables that don't cancel each other out has a nonzero coefficient. The difficulty is making sure that I haven't missed any cases.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, I am worried that I have not taken into consideration all possible cases, and with the last case, case 3, I am overwhelmed with all the possibilities, and could really use some guidance as to 1) what the possibilities are and 2) how to most efficiently approach taking care of them.</p>

However, there is something in this proof that I do not understand and I was hoping that someone could explain it to me.</p>

<p>The proof goes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $q = \frac{f(X)}{g(X}$ be a non-constant rational function reduced to lowest terms and let the greater of the degrees of its numerator and denominator be $n$.</p>
  
  <p>The element $X$ satisfies the equation $q g(X) - f(X) = 0$, the coefficients of which are in the field $F(q)$. <strong>If all these coefficients were zero, we could take one non-zero coefficient $b_{\nu}$ in $g(X)$ and the coefficient $a_{\nu}$ of the same power of $X$ in $f(X)$, and then we would have that $qb_{\nu}-a_{\nu} = 0$.</strong></p>
  
  <p>This would mean that $\displaystyle q = \frac{a_{\nu}}{b_{\nu}}$ equals a constant, contrary to the supposition.</p>
  
  <p>Thus, at least one coefficient in $qg(X) - f(X) = 0$ differs from zero, and we conclude that $X$ is algebraic with respect to $F(q)$.</p>
  
  <p>If $F(q)$ were algebraic with respect to $F$, then also $X$ should be algebraic with respect to $F$, which it is not. <strong>Therefore, we see that $F(q)$ is transcendental.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The things I don't understand are the things I wrote in bold face. </p>

<ol>
<li>I don't understand how if all the coefficients of $qg(X) - f(X) = 0$ are zero we can take one non-zero coefficient $b_{\nu}\in g(X)$ and the coefficient $a_{\nu}$ of the same power of $X$ in $f(X)$. Didn't they just say all the coefficients were zero??</li>
<li>I don't understand how what I mentioned in bullet point 1 allows us to turn $qg(X) - f(X) = 0$ into $gb_{\nu}-a_{\nu}=0$.</li>
<li>I don't understand how showing that $F(q)$ is transcendental tells us that $q$ itself is transcendental with respect to $F$, although I have the feeling this might be due to some theorem.</li>

"2378384","2378401","How to determine if a Linear Transformation is 1-1, onto from $P_2$ to $\mathbb R^3$","<p>I had a hard time picking a title for this post, so I apologize if it does not encompass everything i'm trying to ask here. </p>

<p>I've been studying linear transformations of vector spaces for my Linear Algebra class and I really, really struggle to understand them. I've asked my professor and tutors to help explain them in a way I can understand I still don't understand them in a lot of cases. Often people on this site do a great job explaining these things in a way I can understand, so i'm bringing the question here in hopes that someone can help me figure it out.  </p>

<p>The following question is from my textbook, and is one i've struggled to understand more than most. The question is:</p>

<p>""Determine whether this Linear Transformation is 1-1, onto:""</p>

<p>$T:\mathscr P_2 \mapsto \mathbb R^3$ defined by:</p>

<p>$T(a + bx +cx^2)$ = $ \left[ 
                      \begin{matrix}
                    2a  -  b \\
                    a  +  b  -  3c \\
                    c  -  a \\
                    \end{matrix}
                    \right] $</p>

<p>Everyone I ask always starts by finding the $ker(T)$, so I guess i'll start there as well:</p>

<p>$\mathbf 1.)$ </p>

<p>$ker(T) = T(a + bx + cx^2)$ = 
                      $ \left[ 
                  \begin{matrix}
                2a  -  b \\
                a  +  b  -  3c \\
                c  -  a \\
                \end{matrix}
                \right] $ = $\left[ \begin{matrix} 0\\ 0\\ 0\\ \end{matrix}               \right]$ $\implies$</p>

<p>$ \mathbf 2.)$ </p>

<p>$2a-b = 0 \implies b=2a$</p>

<p>$a+b-3c = 0 \implies$ ...? I'm not entirely sure here</p>

<p>$c-a=0 \implies a=c$ </p>

<p>$\implies$</p>

<p>$ \mathbf 3.)$ </p>

<p>$\{a+bx+cx^2 : a=c, b=2c\}$ $\implies$
$\{ax + bx + cx^2: cx^2\}$</p>

<p>$= c(1 + x +x^2)$</p>

<p>$\implies ker(T) \neq \{0\}$</p>

<p>$\implies$ T is not 1-1</p>

<p>$\mathbf4.)$ As for onto, the following explanation was given on Chegg, but does not make any sense to me:</p>

<p>""Since the dimensions of the domain space and co-domain space are the same, T is not onto.""</p>

<p>The book gives the answer as ""neither 1-1 or onto"". I can understand why it's not 1-1, but I do not understand why its also not onto. I attempted to make sense of this using the rank-nullity theorem, although I don't have confidence in my work:</p>

<p>$\mathbf 5.)$ </p>

<p>$range(T)$ =  $\begin{bmatrix}
           2a  -  b \\
           a  +  b  -  3c \\
           c  -  a \\
           \end{bmatrix}$
= a$\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\-1 \\ \end{bmatrix}$ + b$\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\0 \\ \end{bmatrix}$ + c$\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -3 \\1 \\ \end{bmatrix}$</p>

<p>= span  { $\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\-1 \\ \end{bmatrix}$ , $\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\0 \\ \end{bmatrix}$ , $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -3 \\1 \\ \end{bmatrix}$ }</p>

<p>But these 3 vectors are not linearly independent( the first vector can be written as a linear combo of the second 2 vectors) and thus not a basis for $range(T)$.  </p>

<p>If i'm not mistaken, </p>

<p>$rank(T) = dim(range(T))$ and </p>

<p>$nullity(T) = dim(ker(T))$ and</p>

<p>$rank(T) + nullity(T) = dim(V)$</p>

<p>Since the $dim(\mathscr P_2) = 3$, but the $rank(T) = 2$, this is why the transformation is not onto?</p>

<p>I'm confusing myself the more I type, so here are my major questions:</p>

<p>$\mathbf a.)$ How was the kernel calculated in steps 2 and 3? I can see the answer, but no matter how many times it's been explained to me I still don't understand it. I'm hoping someone can clarify in a way I understand. If it seems trivial I apologize, but i'm just not ""getting it"". </p>

<p>$\mathbf b.)$ Why is this linear transformation not onto? Is my work in part 5 correct? In general, is there a easier method for verifying if something is onto? </p>

<p>$\mathbf c.)$ What would a basis for the kernel look like in this case? This is mostly to satisfy my own curiosity/understanding of the topic. </p>

<p>$\mathbf d.)$ This is more ""in general"", but if anyone has tips for how to work linear transformations between 2 different vector spaces, I would love to hear them. I REALLY struggle with these, but perhaps hearing generalized advice on how to approach these problems could help me in the future. </p>

<p>It took me about an hour to type this whole thing out with proper syntax, so please don't tell me to ""look it up"". I've exhausted every resource available to me trying to understand problems like this one, and these types of problems in general. I'm seeking help from this site because i'm looking for a different perspective. </p>

<p>I sincerely thank anyone who takes the time to try and help me understand this question, and this concept in general. Thank you so much in advance. </p>

$$\begin{align} ||f||_p=\left\{\int_X |f|^p \text{d}\mu\right\}^{\frac 1p} &amp;=\left\{\int_X |f|^{\lambda p}|f|^{(1-\lambda )p}\text{d}\mu\right\}^{\frac 1p}\\&amp;\le  \left\{\left(\int_X |f|^{\lambda pT}\text{d}\mu\right)^{\frac 1T}\left(\int_X |f|^{(1-\lambda) pQ}\text{d}\mu\right)^{\frac 1Q}\right\}^{\frac 1p}\tag{Hölder's inequality} \\ &amp;=\left\{\left(\int_X |f|^{\lambda p\frac {s}{p\lambda}}\text{d}\mu\right)^{\frac {p\lambda}{s}}\left(\int_X |f|^{(1-\lambda) p\frac {r}{p(1-\lambda)}}\text{d}\mu\right)^{\frac {p(1-\lambda)}{r}}\right\}^{\frac 1p} \\ &amp;=\left\{\left(\int_X |f|^{s}\text{d}\mu\right)^{\frac {p\lambda}{s}}\left(\int_X |f|^{ r}\text{d}\mu\right)^{\frac {p(1-\lambda)}{r}}\right\}^{\frac 1p}\\ &amp;=\left(\int_X |f|^{s}\text{d}\mu\right)^{\frac {\lambda}{s}}\left(\int_X |f|^{ r}\text{d}\mu\right)^{\frac {(1-\lambda)}{r}} \\ &amp;=||f||_s^{\lambda}||f||_r^{1-\lambda}\end{align}$$
Now suppose $\max \{||f||_s,||f||_r\} = ||f||_s$ then $||f||_r \le ||f||_s \Rightarrow ||f||_r^{1-\lambda} \le ||f||_s^{1-\lambda} \Rightarrow ||f||_r^{1-\lambda}||f||_s^{\lambda} \le ||f||_s^{1}$, if $\max \{||f||_s,||f||_r\} = ||f||_r$ then in the above argument map $s \mapsto r$, $r \mapsto s$, $\lambda \mapsto 1-\lambda$, and $1-\lambda \mapsto \lambda$.</p>

<li>Is this a proof by contradiction, so assume deg($v$) >= 4, then by Handshaking Theorem, 2|E(H)| $\geq$ $4*p$. Since there are two spanning trees, with each one having $p-1$ edges, by definition, then $E(T_1)\cup E(T_2) \leq 2*p-1$. Now, since there is a contraction since $4*p$ $!= 2*p-1$.</li>
<li>Is this how the proof is suppose to go? What can I assume when I have two spanning trees in G? </li>

<p>b) Give an example of $G$, $T_1$ and $T_2$ in which every vertex $H$ = $T_1$ $\cup$ $T_2$ has degree of at least 3. </p>

"2378469","2378496","Pick out the sequences which are uniformly convergent:","<p>$(a)f_n(x)=sin^n(x)$ on [$0,\pi/2$[.</p>

<p>$(b)f_n(x)=\frac{x^n}{n}+1$ on [$0,1$[.</p>

<p>$(d)f_n(x)=\frac{1}{1+(x-n)^2}$ on ]$0,\infty$[.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>

<p>(a)Limit function of {$f_n(x)$} on [$0,\pi/2$[ is $$f(x)= \lim_{n\to \infty}sin^n(x)=0$$because on $x\in$[$0,\pi/2$[ $$0\leq sin(x)&lt;1\implies0\leq sin^n(x)&lt;1\implies f(x)= \lim_{n\to \infty}sin^n(x)=0 $$
Now,
$$\left\|f_n-f\right\|=\sup_{x\in [0,pi/2)}\left|sin^n(x)-0\right|= 1.$$Hence,$\left\|f_n-f\right\|\rightarrow1 $ as $n\rightarrow \infty$.Thus,{$f_n$} is NOT UNIFORMLY convergent.</p>

<p>$(b)$Limit function of {$f_n(x)$} on [$0,1$[ is $$f(x)=\lim_{n\to \infty}f_n(x)$$</p>

<p>Now,$$0\leq x &lt;1\implies 0\leq x^n 1&lt;\implies 0\leq \frac{x^n}{n}&lt;\frac{1}{n}\implies 1\leq \frac{x^n}{n}+1&lt;\frac{1}{n}+1$$ $$\implies 1\leq f(x)=\lim_{n\to \infty}f_n(x)&lt;\lim_{n\to\infty}(1+\frac{1}{n})$$.Hence,by Sandwich theorem $f(x)=1$.</p>

<p>Now,</p>

<p>$$\left\|f_n-f\right\|=\sup_{x\in [0,1[}\left|\frac{x^n}{n}+1-1\right|= \sup_{x\in [0,1[}\left|\frac{x^n}{n}\right|=\frac{1}{n}$$.So,$\left\|f_n-f\right\|\rightarrow 0 $ as $n\rightarrow \infty$.Hence,{$f_n$} is UNIFORMLY convergent on [$0,1$[</p>

<p>$(c)$Limit function of {$f_n(x)$} on ]$-\infty,0$[,$$f(x)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{1+(x-n)^2}=0$$</p>

<p>Now,$(x-n)^2\geq 0 \forall x\in \mathbb R\implies 1+(x-n)^2\geq 1 \forall x\in \mathbb R\implies \frac{1}{1+(x-n)^2}\leq 1 \forall x\in \mathbb R $.Hence,$\left\|f_n-f\right\|=\sup_{x\in [-\infty,0[}\left|\frac{1}{1+(x-n)^2}-0\right|=1$
So,$\left\|f_n-f\right\|\rightarrow 1 $ as $n\rightarrow \infty$.Hence,{$f_n$} is  NOT UNIFORMLY convergent on [$0,1$[.</p>

<p>$(d)$for the same reason as in (c),{$f_n$} is NOT UNIFORMLY cconvergent on ]$0,\infty$[.</p>

"2378476","2378489","Numbers of the form $\frac{xyz}{x+y+z}$","<p>It is easy to show that every natural number $n$ can be written as $n = \frac{xy}{x+y}$ with $x,y\in \mathbb{N}$ by setting $x = y = 2n$. Now I experimented a little bit with numbers of the form $n=\frac{xyz}{x+y+z}$ and it seems that every natural number $n$ can be written this way with $x,y,z \in \mathbb{N}$. Now I am asking myself if there is some formula which I am missing which would explain this, or if there is some counterexample. Notice that by setting $x=n, y=2n , z = 3n$ we get $n^2=\frac{xyz}{x+y+z}$, hence there are infinitely many numbers $n^2$ expressible in this way.

$$2^X=\{A\subset X|A\textrm{ is compact and not empty}\}.$$
Given $A,B\in 2^X$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, define
$$N(\epsilon,A)=\{x\in X|d(x,a)&lt;\epsilon\textrm{ for some }a\in A\}$$
and
$$H(A,B)=\inf\{\epsilon&gt;0|A\subset N(\epsilon,B)\textrm{ and }B\subset N(\epsilon,A)\}.$$
It can be proven that $(2^M,H)$ is a metric space.</p>

<p>Now, if $(M_1,d_1)$ and $(M_2,d_2)$ are metric spaces, a function $f:M_1\to M_2$ is called nonexpansive if for every $x_1,x_2\in M_1$ we have
$$d_2(f(x_1),f(x_2))\leq d_1(x_1,x_2).$$
Notice that every isometry is nonexpansive.</p>

<p>Let $(L,||\cdot||)$ be a Banach space and for any $A\subset L$ let $conv(A)$ denote the convex hull of $A$. Let $X$ be a nondegenerate compact convex subset of $L$ with the metric obtained from the norm on $L$. It is well-known (see Dunford and Schwartz's <em>Linear Operators: Part I: General Theory</em>, page 416) that if $A$ is a compact subset of $L$, then so is $conv(A)$. So, we can regard $conv$ as a function from $(2^X,H)$ into $(2^X,H)$.</p>

<p>$conv$ is nonexpansive:</p>

<p>Let $A,B\in 2^X$. Assume that $\epsilon&gt;H(A,B)$, so that $A\subset N(\epsilon,B)$ and $B\subset N(\epsilon,A)$. Let $x\in conv(A)$. Then, we have two cases:</p>

<ol>
<li>$x=\sum_{k=1}^N\lambda_kx_k$ with $x_1,\dots,x_N\in A$ and $\sum_{k=1}^N\lambda_k=1$: In this case, we take any set $\{y_1,\dots,y_N\}\subset B$ such that $d(x_k,y_k)&lt;\epsilon$(*) for $k=1,\dots,N$, so that $y=\sum_{k=1}^N\lambda_ky_k\in conv(B)$. So, $$d(x,y)=||x-y||=||\sum_{k=1}^N\lambda_kx_k-\sum_{k=1}^N\lambda_ky_k||=||\sum_{k=1}^N\lambda_k(x_k-y_k)||\leq\sum_{k=1}^N\lambda_k||x_k-y_k||$$
$$&lt;\sum_{k=1}^N\lambda_k\epsilon=\epsilon,$$
so that $x\in N(\epsilon,conv(B))$. Analogously, if $y$ is a convex combination of points of $B$, then $y\in N(\epsilon,conv(A))$.</li>
<li>$x=\lim_{n\to\infty}s_n$ where each $s_n$ is a convex combination of points of $A$, as in the previous case. In this case, define $s'_n$ as $y$ in the previous case: using the same coefficients for points in $B$ which satisfy (*). The sequence $s'_n$ may not be convergent, but since $conv(B)$ is compact, it has a convergent subsequence $s'_{n_k}$ to a point $y\in conv(B)$. Since $s_n\to x$, then $s_{n_k}\to x$, so
$$d(x,y)=||x-y||=||\lim_{k\to\infty}s_{n_k}-\lim_{k\to\infty}s'_{n_k}||=||\lim_{k\to\infty}(s_{n_k}-s'_{n_k})||=\lim_{k\to\infty}||s_{n_k}-s'_{n_k}||\leq\epsilon,$$
since $s_{n_k}$ and $s'_{n-k}$ have the same form as $x$ and $y$ in the previous case. So, $x\in N(\delta,conv(B))\forall\delta&gt;\epsilon$. Analogously, $y\in N(\delta,conv(A))\forall\delta&gt;\epsilon$.</li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, $\forall\delta&gt;\epsilon$ we have that $conv(A)\subset N(\delta,conv(B))$ and $conv(B)\subset N(\delta,conv(A))$, so that
$$H(conv(A),conv(B))=\inf\{\delta&gt;0|conv(A)\subset N(\delta,conv(B))\textrm{ and }conv(B)\subset N(\delta,conv(A))\}\leq\epsilon$$
$\forall\epsilon&gt;H(A,B)$, so $H(conv(A),conv(B))\leq H(A,B)$.</p>

$\newcommand{\Ar}{\operatorname{Ar}}$
$\newcommand{\id}{\operatorname{id}}$
$\newcommand{\ad}{\mathrm{ad}}$
Say $F : C \leftrightarrows D : G$ is a pair of adjoint functors, $F \dashv G$.
Then there is some isomorphism pair
$$(~_\ad) : \Hom_D(FX,Y) \cong \Hom_C(X,GY) : (~^\ad)$$
natural in $X ∈ \Ob C$ and $Y ∈ \Ob D$.
I want to prove that $G$ respects limits like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $Q\colon I → D$ be any diagram in $D$. Define the categories of cones for $Q$ and $GQ$ as the comma categories $D' = (Δ_D,Q)$ and $C' = (Δ_C,GQ)$ where $Δ_C$ and $Δ_D$ are the diagonal functors $C → C^I$ and $D → D^I$ respectively (and $Q$ and $GQ$ are meant to be constant functors $\star → D^I$ and $\star → C^I$ here if one wants to keep things formal).</p>
  
  <p>Then $Q$ and $GQ$ have limits in $D$ and $C$ if and only if $D'$ and $C'$ have terminal objects respectively.</p>
  
  <p>Now, $F$ and $G$ lift to functors $F' \colon C' → D'$ and $G' \colon D' → C'$, using the adjunction. Formally,
  \begin{align}
F' \colon C' &amp;→ D' &amp; G' \colon D' &amp;→ C' \\
(x,α,GQ) &amp;↦ (Fx,α^\ad,Q) \quad\text{on $\Ob C'$}&amp;
(y,β,Q) &amp;↦ (Gy,Gβ,GQ)\quad\text{on $\Ob D'$}\\
(f,\id_\star) &amp;↦ (Ff,\id_\star)\quad\text{on $\Ar C'$}&amp;
(g,\id_\star) &amp;↦ (Gg,\id_\star)\quad\text{on $\Ar D'$}.
\end{align}
  Less formally, while $G'$ is just the the application of $G$ on any cone over $Q$, the functor $F'$ takes the top of a cone over $GQ$ to $D$ by applying $F$ and transposes the actual cone using the adjunction to get a cone over $Q$. By the naturality of the adjunction, this is well-defined; as $F$ and $G$ are functors, so are $F'$ and $G'$.</p>
  
  <p>So if now we could prove $F' \dashv G'$, then we would be done: As a right adjoint, $G'$ obviously preserves terminal objects, thus: $G$ preserves limits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it true that $F' \dashv G'$? How can I go about proving it? Or is the situation too cluttered and another route might be preferable?</p>

"2378600","2378646","Intuition: Example of a transpose matrix representing a dual map","<p>I'm reading Axler's <strong>Linear Algebra Done Right</strong> and trying to understand
exactly what the transpose of a matrix represents. To get some intuition, I
constructed the following example:</p>

<p>Let's say we're working with the two vector spaces $\mathbb{R}^3$ and
$\mathbb{R}^2$.</p>

<p>We have the linear map $T$:
$$ T : \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$$
$$ T(x,y,z) = (2x + 3y, 4z) $$</p>

<p>We also have the linear functional $\phi$:
$$ \phi : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$
$$ \phi(x,y) = (x + y) $$</p>

<p>We can compose these together:</p>

<p>$$ \phi \circ T : \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$
$$ [\phi \circ T](x,y,z) = (2x + 3y - 4z) $$</p>

<p>We can also represent $T$ and $\phi$ with matrices:</p>

<p>$$ \mathcal{M}(T) = \left( \begin{array} &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -4 \end{array} \right) $$
$$ \mathcal{M}(\phi) = \left( \begin{array} &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \end{array} \right)$$</p>

<p>So the matrix representation of $\phi \circ T$ is:</p>

<p>$$\mathcal{M}(\phi)\mathcal{M}(T) = \left( \begin{array} &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; -4 \end{array} \right) $$</p>

<p>The dual space of $\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathbb{R}^{3\prime}$, is the set of linear
functionals $\mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and likewise for
$\mathbb{R}^2$</p>

<p>Now, let $T\prime$ be the dual map of $T$:</p>

<p>$$
T^\prime : \mathbb{R}^{2\prime} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{3\prime}
$$
$$
T^\prime(\phi) = \phi \circ T
$$</p>

<p>So $T^\prime$ is a ""higher-order function"" that maps one type of linear
functionals to another type of linear functional.</p>

<p>Supposedly, the matrix representation of $T^\prime$ is $\mathcal{M}(T)^T$, so</p>

<p>$$\mathcal{M}(T^\prime) = 
\left(
\begin{array}
&amp; 2 &amp; 0 \\
  3 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; -4
\end{array}
\right)
$$</p>

<p>If everything is correct so far, the question I have is how to get from this
matrix to $ \left( \begin{array} &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; -4 \end{array} \right)$, which I
would expect to, again, be the final result. I would have expected that I could
simply multiply $\mathcal{M}(T^\prime)$ by $\mathcal{M}(\phi)$, since $\phi$ is
already an element of $\mathbb{R}^{2\prime}$, but that matrix is 1x2. So it seems
I would have to take its transpose as well, multiply it to the right of
$T^\prime$ to get a 3x1 matrix, and then transpose that to get the expected 1x3
matrix.</p>

<p>I'm guessing this is related to the algebraic property of dual maps that </p>

<p>$$ (ST)^\prime = T^\prime S^\prime $$</p>

<p>for all linear maps $S$ and $T$, but I don't understand why.</p>

First, I wrote $\forall X^n\forall v_1...\forall v_nX^n(...v_i...v_j...)$ and $\forall X^n\forall v_1...\forall v_nX^n(...v_j...v_i...)$ but it seems that the quantifier $\forall X^n\forall v_1...\forall v_n$ does not bound the variables ($...v_j...v_i...$).
Also, I wrote $\forall X^n\forall v_1...\forall v_nX^n(v_1...v_i...v_j...v_n)$ and $\forall X^n\forall v_1...\forall v_nX^n(v_1...v_j...v_i...v_n)$ but it seems that the variable $v_1$ and $v_i$ could not change their locations even if I want to consider the case that $\forall X^n\forall v_1...\forall v_nX^n(v_1v_2...v_n)$ and $\forall X^n\forall v_1...\forall v_nX^n(v_2v_1...v_n)$.</p>

<p>Let $0&lt;a&lt;b$, then $(0,b)=(0,a) \cup [a,b)$ thus $$\int_a^bf= \int_0^bf - \int_0^af \Rightarrow \int_a^bf=0$$</p>

<p>With the same argument we can prove that $m(\{x:-f(x)&gt;0\})=0$</p>

<p>Combining these we have that $$m(\{x:f(x) \neq 0\}) \leqslant m(\{x:f(x)&gt;0\})+m(\{x:-f(x)&gt;0\})=0$$</p>

<p>$\therefore$ $m(\{x:f(x) \neq 0\})=0$</p>

<p>$$Second-solution$$</p>

<p>Now $ \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$ we have in the same way as above that $\frac{1}{2 \delta}\int_{x-\delta}^{x+\delta}f(y)dy=0 ,\forall \delta&gt;0$.</p>

<p>From Lebesgue's differentation theorem we have that $\lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{2\delta}\int_{x-\delta}^{x+\delta}f(y)dy =f(x)$ almost everywhere.</p>

<p>\begin{align}
&amp; \lnot [\lnot \exists B. \forall n. P]\\

<p>\begin{align}
&amp; \lnot [\lnot \exists B. \forall n. P]\\
\iff &amp; \exists B. \lnot \forall n. P
\end{align}</p>

<p>This result is the right one, but was the way I did it correct? I know how unquantified propositions are negated based on an intuition. That ""not A or not B"" or ""at most one of A and B"" or ""either A <em>or</em> B"" ($\lnot A \lor \lnot B$) is the negation of ""both of A and B"" ($A \land B$) makes intuitive sense. I do not have this intuition about quantified expressions however, and I can not claim that it makes intuitive sense to me that $\exists B. \lnot \forall n. P$ is in fact the negation of $\lnot \exists B. \forall n. P$. As a matter of fact, intuitively $\exists B. \forall n. P$ would make more sense to me as the negation of $\lnot \exists B. \forall n.

<p>""Yes, there is a snail (at least one) that eats every salad""</p>

<p>Which structurally would correspond to $\lnot \exists B. \forall n. P$ and $\exists B. \forall n. P$ respectively.</p>

<p>Edit: I came up with this before seeing @Marcus M 's answer; it's the same I think: </p>

<p>Would it be okay to argue as follows? $W_t - W_s$ is independent from $W_s-W_0 = W_s$, so $E(h(W_t-W_s)|W_s) = E(h(W_t-W_s)|W_s-W_0) = E(h(W_t-W_s))$. I think this even works if $W_0$ is a non-zero constant because conditioning on $W_s-W_0$ would still be equivalent to conditioning on $W_s$?</p>

"2379276","2379297","Checking Linearity of $T:\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{F})\to\mathbf{R^2}$","<p>Is the Following Proof Correct?</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Given that $b,c\in\mathbf{R}$. Define $T:\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{R})\to \mathbf{R^2}$
$$Tp=(3p(4),5p'(6)+bp(1)p(2),\int_{-1}^{2}x^3p(x)dx+c\sin p(0))$$
Show that $T$ is linear if and only if $b=c=0$.</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> $(\Rightarrow).$ Assume that $T$ as defined above is Linear and let $p_1,p_2\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{F})$ such that 
$$p_1(1),p_2(1),p_1(2),p_2(2)\neq 0\tag{1}$$ and 
$$\forall q\in\mathbf{Z}(p_1(0),p_2(0)\neq \ q\pi)\tag{2}$$
The linearity of $T$ implies that $T(p_1+p_2)=T(p_1)+T(p_2)$. Thus 
$$T(p_1+p_2)=(3(p_1(4)+p_2(4)),5(p_1'(6)+p_2'(6))+$$
$$b(p_1(1)+p_2(1))(p_1(2)+p_2(2)),\int_{-1}^{2}x^3(p_1(x)+p_2(x))dx+c\sin (p_1(0)+p_2(0)))\tag{3}$$
and 
$$T(p_1)+T(p_2)=(3(p_1(4)+p_2(4)),5(p_1'(6)+p_2'(6))+$$
$$b(p_1(1)p_1(2)+p_2(1)p_2(2)),\int_{-1}^{2}x^3(p_1(x)+p_2(x))dx+c(\sin p_1(0)+\sin p_2(0))\tag{4}$$
From the above two equations we may deduce that 
$$b(p_1(1)+p_2(1))(p_1(2)+p_2(2))=b(p_1(1)p_1(2)+p_2(1)p_2(2))\tag{5}$$
$$c\sin (p_1(0)+p_2(0)))=c(\sin p_1(0)+\sin p_2(0))\tag{6}$$</p>

<p>After some Algebraic manipulation we have 
$$0=b(p_1(1)p_2(2)+p_2(1)p_1(2))\tag{7}$$
$$0=c(\sin p_1(0)(\cos p_2(0)-1)+\sin p_2(0)(\cos p_1(0)-1))\tag{8}$$
Owing to condition $(1)$ we know that the term in the parenthesis of $(7)$ is $\neq 0$ consequently $b=0$ a similar conclusion can be made about $(8)$ owing to condition $(2)$ implying that $c=0$.</p>

<p>$(\Leftarrow).$ Assume now that $b=c=0$ and let $p_1$ and $p_2$ be arbitrary polynomials in $\mathcal{P(\mathbf{F})}$. Computing $T(p_1+p_2)$ and $T(p_1)+T(p_2)$ for $p_1$ and $p_2$ will yield the same equations as in $(3)$ and $(4)$ but since $b=c=0$ it follows that $T(p_1+p_2)=T(p_1)+T(p_2)$.</p>

<p>Now assume that $p\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{F})$ and let $\lambda\in\mathbf{F}$ then 
$$T(\lambda p)=(3\lambda p(4),5\lambda p'(6)+b\lambda p(1)\lambda p(2),\int_{-1}^{2}x^3\lambda p(x)dx+c\sin \lambda p(0))\tag{10}$$
and 
$$\lambda T(p)=(3\lambda p(4),5\lambda p'(6)+\lambda bp(1)p(2),\int_{-1}^{2}x^3\lambda p(x)dx+c\lambda \sin p(0))\tag{11}$$
Since $b=c=0$ it follows that $$T(\lambda p)=\lambda T(p)$$</p>

<p>I am aware that I can directly conclude using that $\{\pm 1\}$ acts freely and properly discontinuously on the space $$\mathbb{R}P^n=\mathbb{S}^n/\{\pm 1\}$$
so that $\pi_n$ is a covering space. Besides, the smoothness of $\pi_n$ is easily read in charts. </p>

<p>However, I would like to read directly the desired property in charts using the inverse function theorem.</p>

<p>To do so, let $p\in\mathbb{S}^n$, one can assume without loss of generality that $p$ lies in the northern hemisphere so that:
$$\phi\colon x\mapsto (x_1,\ldots,x_n)$$
is a chart of $\mathbb{S}^n$ around $p$ whose inverse is given by:
$$\phi^{-1}\colon (x_1,\ldots,x_n)\mapsto\left(x_1,\ldots,x_n,\sqrt{1-{x_1}^2-\cdots-{x_n}^2}\right).$$
Furthermore, the following map is a chart of $\mathbb{R}P^n$ around $\pi_n(p)$:
$$\psi\colon[x_1:\cdots:x_n:x_{n+1}]\mapsto \left(\frac{x_1}{x_{n+1}},\ldots,\frac{x_n}{x_{n+1}}\right).$$
Read in these above charts $\pi_n$ gives rise to:
$$g:=\psi\circ\pi_n\circ\phi^{-1}\colon(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\mapsto\left(\frac{x_1}{\sqrt{1-{x_1}^2-\cdots-{x_n}^2}},\ldots,\frac{x_n}{\sqrt{1-{x_1}^2-\cdots-{x_n}^2}}\right).$$

<li><p>Third note that $f_\alpha$ is minimal. Indeed if $f(\alpha) = 0$ then $f(\sigma(\alpha)) = \sigma(f(\alpha)) = \sigma(0) = 0$ for all $\sigma \in G$. Thus $\sigma(\alpha)$ is a root for all $\sigma \in G$. Thus $f_\alpha \mid f$.</p></li>

<p>Now when we dualize, we obtain $$(1):\quad \psi^*:K[X]\to K[G]\otimes K[X].$$ So to dualize, I am of the maybe false opinion, we are essentially working with a pullback. Say we were working with the left translation $\psi_x(y)=x^{-1}y$.</p>

<p>Then we can define on $f\in K[X]$ $f(x^{-1}y)=f\circ \psi_x(y)=\psi_x^*(f)(y)$, so we can naturally think of $\psi_x^*:K[X]\to K[X]$. But then, moving to $\psi^*$, surely I obtain:
$$\psi^*:G\times K[X]\to K[X],$$

<p>If three sides of a trapezoid are each 6 inches long, how long must the fourth side be if the area is a maximum?</p>

<p>My work:</p>

<p>I do know that the area of a trapezoid is $A=0.5h(b_1 + b_2).$ But I need to express $A$ in terms of single variable $x$. You know.....$A = f(x)$. I imagine the problem like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hzAzu.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hzAzu.png"" alt=""Trapezoid""></a></p>

<p>The area of the trapezoid now is $$A = \frac{1}{2} (6) ((6+\sqrt {x^2 - 36})+6)$$</p>

<p>Then: $$A = 3(12 + \sqrt {x^2 -36})$$ $$A = 36 + 3\sqrt {x^2 -36}$$</p>

<p>Differentiating the above equation with respect to $x$, we get:</p>

<p>$$\frac{dA}{dx} = 0 + 3\left(\frac{1}{2} (x^2-36)^\frac{-1}{2} (2x)\right )$$</p>

<p>$$\frac{dA}{dx} = \frac{3x}{2(x^2-36)^\frac{1}{2}}$$</p>

<p>I set $\frac{dA}{dx}$ to be zero to get the value of fourth side of trapezoid that makes its area maximum.</p>

<p>$$0= \frac{3x}{2(x^2-36)^\frac{1}{2}}$$</p>

<p>I got $x = 0$, which essentially makes the trapezoid losing its fourth side.</p>

$5$ ways for three consecutive to occur, $2$ ways for four consecutives and $1$ way of five consecutives. By symmetry, there should be $16$ desirable choices. </p>

Since we know all our samples are independent of each other, the answer would appear to be the mean of the geometric distribution that results with $p=0.0013499$, which is $740.97$. </p>

<p>However, by simulating a large number of trials I found that the true answer is around 444 trials. (Here's the mathematica code to show this <code>Table[Table[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[]], {x, 1, 444}] //

<p>This can also be verified mathematically by solving the reverse problem: the expected sample maximum from $N$ trials. Note that $[Pr(x &lt;= K)]^{444}$ — the probability that the results from all 444 trials are less than k — constitutes a CDF for all 444 trials. From this the corresponding PDF (albeit in terms of Erf function) can be found by differentiating, and finding the expected value of this PDF (or letting mathematica approximate the integral numerically) indeed gives that 444 trials is sufficient to have an expected sample maximum of 3.</p>

"2379923","2380414","Nested Sequence of Topological Space and the Coherent Topology; Munkres Topology 35.9","<p>This is problem 9 from chapter 35 in Munkres:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pD6g5.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pD6g5.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Here's my attempted solution:</p>

<p>a. </p>

<p>The fact that the coherent set is in fact a topology on $X$ is simple. I won't show it here.</p>

<p>In order to show that $X_i$ is a subspace of $X$ we must show that $\tau_i = \{X_i \cap U | U$ open in $X \}$, where $\tau_i$ is the given topology of $X_i$.</p>

<p>So let $U_i \in \tau_i$. Let $j &lt; i$. Since $X_j$ is a subspace of $X_i$ (by induction), $X_j \cap U_i$ is open in $X_j$. For $i &lt; j$ we have that, again by induction, that $X_i$ is closed in $X_j$. Since $X_i - U_i$ is closed in $X_i$ we have that $X_j \cap (X_i - U_i) = X_j - U_i$ is closed in $X_j$. So $U_i$ is open in $X_j$. It follows that $U_i = X_i \cap U_i$ where $U_i$ is open in $X$. The other direction is direct from the definition.</p>

<p>b. </p>

<p>Let $f: X \to Y$ be with $f_{|X_i}$ continuous for each $i$.</p>

<p>Take $x \in X$, and let $f(x) \in V$ open in $X$. $\exists x \in X_i$ for some $i$ and $f_{|X_i}(x) \in V$ as well. Since $f_{|X_i}$ is continuous $\exists x \in U_i$ open in $X_i$ s.t $f_{|X_i}(U_i) \subset V$. But $f(U_i) = f_{|X_i}(U_i)$. We've showed above that $U_i$ is open in $X$, so $f$ is continuous. </p>

<p>c.</p>

<p>Let  $A,B$ be closed and disjoint in $X$. Define $f_0: A \cup B \to [0,1]$ by $f(A) = \{0\}$, $f(B) = \{1\}$ which is continuous. We note that $A \cup B$ is closed in $A \cup B \cup X_1$ because $(A \cup B \cup X_1) \cap (A \cup B) = A \cup B$ and $A \cup B$ is closed in $X$.</p>

<p>By Tietze extend $f_0$ to $f_1:A \cup B \cup X_1 \to [0,1] $. Do so inductively (the above argument works for any $i$), to get $f_i$ a continuous extension of $f_{i-1}$. Define $f: X \to [0,1]$ by $f(x) = f_i(x)$ whence $x \in X_i$, it is well defined since the sequence is of extensions and the spaces are nested. By clause b. $f$ is continuous. We see that $A \subset f^{-1}([0,\frac{1}{2}))$ and that $B \subset f^{-1}((\frac{1}{2}, 1])$, disjoint open neighbourhoods of $X$.</p>

It seems it lays a foundation for sound evaluation rules of dependent object types.</p>

<p>However, I do not understand the evaluation works. Page 4 of <a href=""http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/215280"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the DOT paper</a> mentions the following five evaluation rules ($\lambda$ represented using \)</p>

<pre><code>         let x = v in e[x y]   -&gt;   let x = v in e[[z := y]t] if v = \(z :T)t

<p>For I have three questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>If we follow the rules in this order of priority, if the value y assigned to x is not a value (a lambda), it seems that x is immediately replaced by y in t. But this seems to contradict the fact that they suppose it's call-by-need, that is, we evaluate lets only once.</li>
<li>If we says that the rules can be applied in any order, the complexity of evaluation can dramatically increase (e.g. if <code>t =</code> $\lambda f. f x x x$), so is it really out-of-order evaluation? </li>
<li>Are the rules of lambda-calculus implicitly added, or can they be recovered from this calculus ?</li>

\[(u_1,u_2)+(v_1,v_2)=(u_1+v_1,u_2+v_2)\]
\[c(v_1,v_2)=(cv_1,cv_2)\]
But then today I came across the fact that if $V$ has linear subspaces $V_1$, $V_2$ and every $v\in V$ can be written uniquly as:
$$v=v_1+v_2$$
for $v_i \in V_i$ then $V=V_1\oplus V_2$. I cannot see how this makes sense given the definition above. Is the above definition wrong? If not how can $V$ have the form $(v_1,v_2)$ when $v_1,v_2 \in V$?</p>

"2380076","2380236","Differential form of the inverse Weierstrass P-function","<p>I will begin by an giving some motivation:</p>

<p>Let $(x,y)$ be some point in the plane, the polar coordinates are defined implicitly by
$$r \cos \theta=x, \\r \sin \theta =y.$$
Suppose $r \neq 0$, and define $X=x/r,Y=y/r$. We then have
$$\cos \theta=X, \\ \sin \theta =Y, $$
and $X^2+Y^2=1$. Taking the differential of both equations gives
$$-\sin \theta \mathrm{d} \theta=\mathrm{d} X, \\ \cos(\theta) \mathrm{d} \theta=dY.$$
It is now evident that
$$\mathrm{d} \theta=-Y \mathrm{d} X+X \mathrm{d} Y ,$$ and this is a derivation of that well-known result. An interesting point here is that $\mathrm{d} \theta$ is well defined, even though $\theta$ itself isn't a single-valued function.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now to my analogous question: Suppose instead that $X,Y$ lie on the Weierstrass elliptic curve $$Y^2=4X^3-g_2 X-g_3 $$ for some constants $g_2,g_3$. Then, there is some $\theta$, depending on $X$ and $Y$ satisfying
$$\wp(\theta;g_2,g_3)=X, \\
\wp'(\theta;g_2,g_3)=Y, $$
with $\wp$ being the Weierstrass P-function. Taking the differentials, we get
$$\wp'(\theta;g_2,g_3) \mathrm{d} \theta=\mathrm{d} X,  \\
\wp''(\theta;g_2,g_3) \mathrm{d} \theta=\mathrm{d} Y.$$</p>

<p>Furthermore, using the 2nd order ODE for $\wp$, the pair of equations simplifies to
$$\wp'(\theta;g_2,g_3) \mathrm{d} \theta=\mathrm{d} X, \\
\left( 6 \wp^2(\theta;g_2,g_3)-\frac{1}{2} g_2 \right) \mathrm{d} \theta=\mathrm{d}Y $$
I tried to manipulate these two algebraically to get a ""nice"" expression for $\mathrm{d} \theta$ in this case, but I couldn't do it. I was wondering if there's any simple expression for $\mathrm{d} \theta$ after all, and if there is, I'd like to see it. Thank you!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Attempt</strong></p>

<p>If $f$ is not constant, then there exists $x,y$ such that $x\neq y\Rightarrow f(x)\neq f(y)$. Then, $0&lt;|f(x)-f(y)|$. Between any two distinct real numbers, we can always find a real number. Let's pick a real number between $0$ and $|f(x)-f(y)|$, and call that number $c$. 
Then, $0&lt;c&lt;|f(x)-f(y)|$.</p>

<p>Now let's look at $|x-y|$, which is also greater than $0$. For our $c$, no matter what positive number we have picked, and no matter how large $|x-y|$ is, it is possible to pick $M&gt;0$ arbitrarily close to $0$ and $\alpha&gt;1$ arbitrarily close to $1$ so that </p>

<p>But, the problem states that $|f(x)-f(y)|\le M|x-y|^\alpha$, so the only way to meet this condition is if $f(x)=f(y)$ regardless of our choice of $x,y$. If $f(x)=f(y)$ regardless of our choice of $x,y$, then this means that $f$ is constant.</p>

<p>In particular, I would like to see the difference between the following two sets. </p>

<p>That is we are looking at the set 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{P}_1=\left \{ F:  F=(1-t) \delta_{x_1}+t \delta_{x_2}, \, t\in[0,1], \, x_1,x_2 \in \mathbb{R}, \int x^4 dF(x)=c  \right\}\\

\end{align}
for some $c&gt;0$.  (Note that all we did is changed equality to inequality).</p>

<p><strong>Proof that the sets are closed:</strong></p>

<p>Let $ F_n \in \mathcal{P}_2$   converge weakly to $F$.  Weak convergence is equivalent to 
\begin{align}
\liminf_{n \to \infty} \int f(x) dF_n(x) \ge  \int f(x) dF(x)

for all continuous function $f(x)$.  So, we have that
\begin{align}
\liminf_{n \to \infty} \int x^4 dF_n(x)= c \ge  \int x^4 dF(x)
\end{align}</p>

<p>This implies that $\mathcal{P}_2$ is closed. <strong>What about  $\mathcal{P}_1$?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Proof that the sets are compact:</strong></p>

<p>By <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokhorov%27s_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Prokhorov's theorem</a> set is tight if it is closed and tight. </p>

<p>The set is tight if for all $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists an $a$ such that

\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}[|X|&gt;a] \le  \frac{E[X^4]}{a^4} =  \frac{c^2}{a^4}
\end{align}
Choose $a^4=\frac{\epsilon}{c^2}$ and we have that both $\mathcal{P}_1$ and $\mathcal{P}_2$ are tight sets.</p>

The initial part of the proof, in broad brushstrokes, considers that the elements in the group can only be of order 1,2,3,6. Clearly if there is an element of order 6 the group 6 is cyclic. Now it must have an element of order 2 but cannot have only elements of order 2 (due to the group order of 6), so it would otherwise have an element of order 2 and an element of order 3. So far so good.</p>

<p>Now what I am stuck on is considering the cases for the scenario with an element of order 3, say $r\in G$, and of order 2, say $s\in G$. Now to be dihedral there is not only the fact of having some element of order n and one of order 2, but also the relationship $srs^{-1}=r^{-1}$ must be obeyed. So the proof proceeds to consider these cases.</p>

<p>We know that the cyclic group generated by r, $&lt;r&gt;$, has index 2 and thus is a normal subgroup. So we can have </p>

<li><p>$srs^{-1}=srs=e$ which is not possible since this would require $r=e$ which is not the case</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong><br>
An idea popped into my head, to reformulate things. We start with a $q$-regualr graph with $V$ vertices and $E=\frac{qV}2$ edges. Can we then always choose a rotation system $R$, such that  we get $F=\frac{qV}p$ $p\text{-gonal}$ faces? (Remember that $p$, $q$, $V$, $E$, $F$ are given.)  </p>

<p>The questions that must be answered in this case are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can we always draw a $q$-regular graph with $V$ vertices and $E=\frac{qV}2$ edges?</li>
<li>Can we always give this graph a the rotation system $R$ described above?</li>
</ul>

<p>Does this make the problem any more feasible?</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong><br>
As mentioned in the comments, there is an natural relation with tessellations of the hyperbolic plane and Poincaré's (polygon) Theorem. </p>

<p>The road to walk in this case looks, to the best of my understanding, like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consider the $\{p,q\}$ tessellation of the hyperbolic plane ($\mathbb D$). </li>
<li>Try to find a simply-connected subset $P$ of this tessellation consisting of $F$ $p$-gons. Say the border of $P$ consists of $Z$ sides (each side of $P$ should be an edge of a $p$-gon).</li>
<li>Find suitable side pairing for $P$. Suitable, meaning they turn $P$ into $S$.</li>
</ul>

<p>The questions that must now be answered are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can we always make a simply-connected $P$, consisting of  $F$ $p$-gons such that the number of vertices and edges are ""<em>correct</em>"".</li>
<li>Can we then also find  suitable side pairings?</li>
</ul>

<p>This method is the least fruitful in my opinion. Notice how the two questions to be answered here are intertwined (the number of vertices and edged is dependent on the side pairings). I already found that this is a very useful heuristic method, but it probably doen't help that much to find a genral answer.

  <p>Is there a ""next"" or ""successor"" metric in topology?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following on from <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2379996/"">this question</a> (the answer to which turned out to be a little more complicated than I expected, and seems to have created a certain amount of disagreement!), asking what is the boundary of a sequence of integers in the space $\mathbb{N}$, I was naturally intrigued to find out if there's a metric which says that two points are ""close"" if they are next to each other, i.e. one's an immediate successor of the other or there's no other point in-between.</p>

<p>The motivation behind this is that even the metrics and topological spaces which make no reference to $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_p$ etc., still seem to have the in-built assumption that there's a void between any two integers, an assumption seemingly without basis in the circumstances, and this seems to make the topological definition of the boundaries of a sequence of integers counterintuitive.</p>

<p>If we had a metric which said that only immediate successor was ""in the neighborhood"", or alternatively the restrict the metric to integer values: $\lvert a-b\rvert\in\mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}$ then surely first and last elements of such a sequence could be defined as the boundary of a closed set and the integers one greater and one less than those as the boundaries of an open set.</p>

<p>This would seem to be a natural way to describe the topology of a discrete sequence of integers, or am I missing something?  Is there some clear advantage to the way it's done?</p>

<p>I haven't even been able to show this in a single direction. My efforts have been to show that if $K$ is the splitting field for some set of polynomials $\{f_1,\ldots,f_r\}\subset F[x]$, than any irreducible polynomial $p(x)\in F[x]$ that has a root in $K$ must split completely. Let $p(\alpha)=0$ with $\alpha\in K$. Then we can factor $p(x)$ over $K$: $p(x)=(x-\alpha)p'(x)$.</p>

<p>From here I am actually stuck. It seems showing $p'(x)$ must have a root in $K$ would be useful but isn't really sufficient to show that it splits completely. My progress on that front is as follows. Letting $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ be roots of some irreducible (over $F$) factor of one of the $f_i$, we have an automorphism $\phi$ of $K$ obtained by extending the isomorphism $F(\beta_1)\to F(\beta_2)$ to $K$, which in turn extends the identity map on $F$. This fixes $F$ so fixes $p(x)$. Then we have $\phi((x-\alpha)p'(x))=(x-\phi(\alpha))\phi(p'(x))=p(x)$. Thus, if $\phi(\alpha)\neq\alpha$, then we have a new root for $p(x)$ over $K$. But I don't see why one of these automorphisms necessarily doesn't fix $\alpha$, or how we can show $p(x)$ necessarily splits completely this way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Proposition 8.7</strong> $\text{ch}(e_1, ..., e_n)$ always has a nonempty inteiror as a subset of $S(e_1, ..., e_n)$.</p>
  
  <p><em>Proof</em> $~~$ By successively throwing out dependent vectors from $P = \{e_j − e_1\}_{j=2}^n$, find a maximal independent subset of $P$. By relabeling, suppose it is $P' = \{e_j − e_1\}_{j=2}^k$ so $\{e_1, ... , e_k\}$ are affinely independent, and each $e_\ell − e_1$ with $\ell &gt; k$ is a linear combination of $P'$. Then $\text{S}(e_1, . . . , e_n) = \text{S}(e_1, . . . , e_k )$.</p>
  
  <p>$\color{red}{\text{Since}~\text{ch}(e_1, . . . , e_k ) \subset \text{ch}(e_1,...,e_n),~\text{it suffices to prove the result when}~e_1, . . . , e_n~\text{are}}$ $~\color{red}{\text{ affinely independent.}}$ In that case, $\varphi: \Delta_{n-1}\to \text{ch}(e_1, . . . , e_k )$ is a bijection and continuous, so a homeomorphism. Since $\Delta_{n-1}$ has a nonempty interior ($\{(\theta_1, . . . , \theta_n ) | \sum_{i=1}^n\theta_i = 1, 0 &lt; \theta_i\}$), so does $\text{ch}(e_1, . . . , e_k )$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if I didn't misunderstood nothing, we have to state the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given points $x_1, ..., x_k, x_{k+1}, ..., x_n$ in a locally convex topological vector space, then $\text{int}(\text{ch}(x_1, ..., x_k))\subset\text{int}(\text{ch}(x_1, ...,  x_n))$.</p>

<p>Here, ""$\text{ch}(A)$"" is the <strong>convex-hull</strong> and $\text{S}(A)$ is the affine span of $A$. The interior taken is relative to the subspace-topology of the affine span (the relative/intrinsic interior).</p>

<p>How can I state this result? At the end, I will need this result only for $\Bbb R^v$, for which the conclusion is geometrically clear.</p>

"2380534","2380557","Probability of choosing a of b numbers in exactly c guesses","<p>(This is my first question, and I have not formally learned much probability, so forgive me if this question is too easy.)</p>

<p>Background information: while watching a UK gameshow called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Code_(game_show)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Code</a>, I began wondering how many questions a contestant would need to answer, on average, to win. Relevant to this question, the only thing you need to know about the show is that 3 distinct numbers from 0-9 have been selected, and after answering a question correctly, the contestant chooses a number and gets to see whether it is one of the 3 they are looking for. They need to find all 3 to win.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a general formula for the probability of finding <em>a</em> numbers selected out of a character set of <em>b</em> in exactly <em>c</em> attempts (obviously $a,b,c \in \mathbb N$). In the example that inspired this question, $a = 3$ and $b = 10$ (and I would like to know the probability for all $c \in [3, 10]$, and/or some other way of calculating the median number of guesses necessary).</p>

<p>I have calculated some specific values of <em>c</em> as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>For $c = 3$, the player needs to make three correct guesses in a row, with probability $\frac{3}{10}\cdot\frac{2}{9}\cdot\frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{120}$. I notice that this is the reciprocal of ${10 \choose 3}$, but the next example is not $1 \div {10 \choose 4} = \frac{1}{210}$, so I don't think it's that simple.</li>
<li>For $c = 4$, the player will make three correct guesses and one incorrect one. There are seven incorrect numbers that could be chosen (before the incorrect guess), and there will be a similar 3, 2, 1 pattern to what we saw in the last example for the correct choices. The possible numbers to choose from at each stage will be 10, 9, 8, 7. And finally, there are three potential orders (the incorrect guess can be any of the first three positions, but not the fourth as this is covered by $c=3$). So this gives us the probability: $3 \cdot \frac{7\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1}{10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7} = \frac{1}{40}$, which I believe is correct.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are these calculations correct, and if so, how can they be generalised?</p>

"2380558","2380569","Different intuition for area of circle","<p>I am trying to understand the area of a circle's formula $\pi r^2$ from a different perspective. I've already understood 2 intuitions: infinite isoceles triangles of height $r$ and area $r*b/2$ where the base $b$ makes up the circumference of the circle. I've also come across the calculus explanation where we stretch out the circumference from radius $r$ all the way to radius 0 forming a right triangle of base $r$ and height $2\pi r$ then we just take the area of that triangle to arrive at the formula $\pi r^2$.</p>

<p>I'm now trying to look at it in 2 different ways: </p>

<p>1) $({r \over 2})2\pi r$ : which would mean to add the circumference of the circle $2\pi r$, $r/2$ times.</p>

<p>or </p>

<p>2) $r\pi r$ : which could be understood as adding together $r$ semi-circles $\pi r$.</p>

<p>I tried to represent assumption 1) graphically and drew this image:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GqWa8.png"" alt=""radius 4""></p>

<p>The idea I came up with was that if the area of a circle is the circumference added to itself half the radius times $(r/2)2\pi r$ then that meant that I could break a circle up into parts that combined would make these 2 circumferences.</p>

<p>So given a circle of radius 4, I tried combining the circumference of radius 1 to the one of radius 3 and that left me with 2 circumferences of radius $2\pi r$ and one of radius 2 and circumference $\pi r$. For $r = 4$: </p>

<p>$$\pi r^2 + \pi r = 2\pi r + \frac{3\pi r}{2} + \frac{\pi r}{2} + \pi r$$</p>

<p>That equation is obviously not the area of a circle. The correct one would be:</p>

<p>$$\pi r^2 = 2\pi r + \frac{3\pi r}{2} + \frac{\pi r}{2}$$</p>

<p>But then i would just be forgetting the radius 2 circumference $\pi r$. I'm probably forgetting something, but I don't understand why the area of a circle does not account for that middle circumference. Here's a generalization I created that works for finding the area of a circle following the intuition I presented:</p>

<p>$$\pi r^2 = \sum_{i=1}^\frac{r}{2} \frac{2\pi ri}{r} + \frac{2\pi r (r-i)}{r} = \sum_{i=1}^\frac{r}{2} 2\pi i + 2\pi(r-i) = \sum_{i=1}^\frac{r}{2} 2\pi (i + (r-i))$$</p>

<p>This summation formula works like a charm but I dont understand where the ""red circle"" of radius 2 went, since I just got two $2\pi r$. </p>

<p>Does anyone know what went wrong in my reasoning? What am I missing? Why is my intuition telling me the area of a circle of radius 4 is $\pi r^2 + \pi r$ instead of $\pi r^2$?</p>

"2380744","2380757","Is ""theory of classes"" ""constructive"" in NBG and ZFC? How to state theorems about ""classes"" involving $\exists!$?","<p>The underlying philosophy of constructivism in mathematics is that in order to prove that something exists, we need to ""find"" or ""construct"" it. </p>

<p>In NBG (von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel axiomatic set theory) one can only quantify over sets, as in ZFC (where classes can also be informally treated specifying formulas, for example, instead of $\alpha \in \mathrm{Ord}$ we simply say that $\alpha$ satisfy the formula which asserts as set to be an ordinal).</p>

<p>However, what if we want, for example, to state a theorem that asserts an existence of a certain class? For example, take <em>Transfinite Recursion</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Transfinite Recursion</strong>. Let $G\colon V \to V$ be a class function ($V$ being a class of all sets). Then there is a unique class function $F\colon \mathrm{Ord} \to V$ such that $$\forall \alpha \in \mathrm{Ord}, F(\alpha) = G(F\restriction_{\alpha}).$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've been thinking how can we state this theorem in the language of ZFC and NBG. In ZFC, a ""class function"" from a ""class"" define by a formula $\phi(x)$ to a class defined by a formula $\psi(y)$ is simply a formula $\upsilon(x,y)$ such that $\forall x, \phi(x) \Rightarrow \exists!y \in \psi(y), \upsilon(x,y)$. The problem is the same: we can't quantify neither over formulas in ZFC, nor over classes in NBG.</p>

<p>In transfinite recursion, we can simply circumvent the issue of not being able to write ""for all class functions $G\colon V \to V$"" is to treat is not as an theorem, but an infinitely many theorems, one for each different formula representing a class function. </p>

<p>However, we still can't simply state that some class or some class function ""exists"". But, apparently, we don't have to. The proof of the aforementioned theorem I know of involves the explicit construction of a class function $F\colon \mathrm{Ord} \to V$ by defining a formula.</p>

<p>So, to prove that some class (or a class function, which is still a class in NBG) exists, we have to explicitly construct it? So, in way, theory of classes is ""constructive"" in NBG (and in ZFC, even if there is no theory of classes per se)?</p>

<p>That is, instead of saying that there exists class function, we simply state a formula (I will not write it here, as it is long and requires auxiliary definitions) and prove that it does indeed defines a class function?</p>

<p>But if this is the case, what about uniqueness? To say that there are no other sets $y$ satisfying $\phi(y)$ rather than $x$ is precisely to say that $\forall y, \phi(y) \Rightarrow y = x$. But we can't even say $\forall y,$ if $y$ is a class function.</p>

<p>I understand many here will want a precise question (or questions) rather than a wall of text, so I'll sum my questions up:</p>

<p>$(1)$ Is giving an explicit construction of a class or a class function the only way of saying that it exists in NBG or ZFC?</p>

<p>$(2)$ If so, how do we say that there is no other class with that property?</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> This question is not only about proving something involving unquantifiable objects in a theory, but also about stating theorems about them.</p>

"2380808","2384892","How many ways are there to bag the marbles?","<p>Suppose we have $n$ marbles each tagged with numbers $1$ through $n$. We have bags which are allowed to contain <em>things</em> where a <em>thing</em> is defined as either $\text{(a)}$ a marble <em>or</em> $\text{(b)}$ another bag.</p>

<p>We want to consider all of the ways which we can ""bag"" the marbles. ""Bagging"" means that the ""end result"", so to speak, is having a set of ""outer"" bags $\{b_1, b_2, b_3 \cdots b_q\}$ such that each marble is contained in one of the outer bags either directly, or indirectly (e.g., a marble  may be within an <em>inner</em> bag which is contained in one of the $b_i$'s, and in general this ""nesting"" can be up to $n$ bags deep).  </p>

<p>We have an endless supply of bags at our disposal. This would suggest that there is an issue. We could put one marble in some bag $b_1$, and put $b_1$ in another bag $b_2$, and continue this process arbitrarily so that we have an infinite number of combinations. We don't allow this. <em>Each bag used must <strong>directly</strong> contain at least one marble.</em></p>

<p>Note that we consider the marble combinations as well. For example, if $n=2$, then one idea is to put one marble in a bag $b_1$ and having another bag $b_2$ which contains the other marble along with $b_1.$ This method counts for <em>two</em> baggings, since the two marbles can switch roles. The reason the marbles are ""tagged"" is to stress this point. </p>

<p>Now, onto the problems:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is an algorithm to compute the number of all possible baggings as a function of $n$? Can it be done in polynomial time? Is there a mathematical closed form? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have tried to formalize this below (if there is a mistake in the ""formalization"", simply go by what I've written above). </p>

<p><strong><em>Formal Definition</em></strong>: </p>

<p>Let $X$ be an arbitrary nonempty finite set. Suppose it has cardinality $n$. To this set, we assign a finite class of sets $B_{X}$. A member of this class is called a ""$B_{X}$ set"". This assignment is defined recursively. </p>

<p>If $n=1$, then $X = \{x_0\}$ is a singleton set. In this case, the sole $B_{X}$ set is simply $X$. </p>

<p>If $n &gt; 1$, then the $B_{X}$ sets of $X$ are those sets $B$ which satisfy the following: $B \cap X \neq \varnothing$, and $B \setminus (B \cap X) = \{B({X_1}), B({X_2}) \cdots B({X_p})\}$ where $X_1, X_2 \cdots X_p$ are pairwise disjoint with $\bigcup_{1 \leq i \leq p} X_i = X \setminus (B \cap X)$ and each $B(X_i)$ is a $B_{X_i}$ set (this is the recursive part; note $|X_i| &lt; |X|=n$). Note that $B \setminus (B \cap X) = \varnothing$ is also allowed. In particular, this implies that all nonempty subsets of $X$ are $B_{X}$ sets. </p>

<p>It's fairly clear that the recursion terminates. </p>

<p>A <em>complete bagging</em> of $X$ is a nonempty finite set $\{b_1, b_2, b_3 \cdots b_q\}$ of sets  where each $b_i$ is a $B_{Y_i}$ set with all of the $Y_i$'s being nonempty, pairwise disjoint and $\bigcup_{1 \leq i \leq q} Y_i = X$. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The number of complete baggings of $X$ depends solely on $n$. Let $C(n)$ denote this quantity. We want to compute $C(n)$. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $\{A_i\}$ be a family of subobjects of an object $A$. Show that if $\mathcal{A}$ is abelian and cocomplete  then there is a smallest subobject $\sum A_i$ of $A$ containing all the $A_i$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of it is worked out on <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/260791/smallest-subobject-in-an-abelian-category-containing-a-set-of-objects"">this question</a>, but I'm confused about how to apply the universal property of the image. </p>

<p>Specifically, $A_i\hookrightarrow A$ are monomorphisms and there's an induced map $\coprod A_j\rightarrow A$. The object $\sum A_j$ is simply the image of this map. Suppose that $Y$ is a subobject of $A$ that contains all the $A_i$. Then there are monomorphisms $A_i\hookrightarrow Y\hookrightarrow A$ (and moreover this composition must be the original $A_i\hookrightarrow A$ since subobjects are equivalence classes of monics with the same domain), so there's an induced map by universal property of the coproduct $\coprod A_j\rightarrow Y$. </p>

<p>Now, in order to apply the universal property of the image like the answer suggests, I need for $\coprod A_j\rightarrow \sum A_j\rightarrow A$ to be the same factorization as $\coprod A_j\rightarrow Y\rightarrow A$. This is where I get stuck. I only get that $A_i\rightarrow \coprod A_j\rightarrow \sum A_j\rightarrow A$ is the same factorization as $A_i\rightarrow\coprod A_j\rightarrow Y\rightarrow A$, and $A_i\rightarrow \coprod A_j$ is in general not an epimorphism. Since I can't cancel on the right, I don't know how to satisfy the requirements to use U.P. for image.</p>

"2380822","2389457","Implementing bias units in machine learning algorithms","<p>I have implemented few fully connected nets.

<p>I don't understand how it works. It seems like a better and more efficient implementation but I don't understand it. For instance , consider the following example:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The first column in X is bias unit and so is the first row in W</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I'm pretty lost on this one.</p>

<p>Since $A$ is a real matrix of finite dimension, there's no problem with replacing $A^*$ with $A^T$, so that makes the problem a little less intimidating for me.</p>

<p>I took a shot at part (a), saying $$\|Ax - b\|^2 = (Ax - b)^T (Ax - b) = x^T A^T A x - x^T A^T b - b^T A x + b^T b$$</p>

<p>Thus, suppose then that (*) has a solution $x$. Then $$x^T A^T A x - x^T A^T b - b^T A x + b^T b = x^T A^T b - x^T A^T b - b^T A x + b^T b = b^T b - b^T A x = b^T(b - Ax)$$</p>

<p>In this case, $\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \|Ax - b\|^2 = \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} b^T (b - Ax)$. This is not good; in principle this can be arbitrarily small (as in going to $-\infty$). So somewhere my reasoning is wrong. Perhaps I'm just not understanding this question.</p>

<p>For (b), would a condition be that $A$ have only 0 in its kernel (while requiring that $b \neq 0$? This doesn't seem like enough. I want to call upon invertibility but $A$ need not be a square matrix.</p>

<p>No idea what to do for (c).</p>

"2380885","2383498","Understanding the definition of completeness of formal theorys(and Godel's famous theorem)","<p>I have some conceptual question about the completeness of a formal theory and hence Godel's first incompleteness theorem. First, to be clear, I give the definition of completeness I mean.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A formal theory $\Gamma$ of a first-order language
$\mathcal{L}$ is <strong>complete</strong> if for every sentence $\phi$ of $\mathcal{L}$, either $\Gamma\vdash\phi$ or $\Gamma\vdash\neg\phi$.</p>

<p>(For convience, the first-order language used in this article allow sentence symbols $P,~Q,~R,\cdots$ etc., which is usually not a way standard mathematical logic books would did, though I don't know why.)</p>

<p>Now my question starts.</p>

<p>Let $\Gamma=\{P,Q\}$, we know that neither $\{P,Q\}\not\vdash R$ nor $\{P,Q\}\not\vdash\neg R$. So here the formal theory $\Gamma$ is not complete, right? Here we don't know the valuation of $R$ under a model $\mathfrak{A}$, denoted by $V_{\mathfrak{A}}(R)$ in this article, is True or False -- in fact, it could be either True or False.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Godel's first incompletness theorem said that, under some assumptions of a consistent formal theory $\Gamma$, $\Gamma$ must be incomplete. Namely, there exists a sentence $\phi$ such that $\Gamma\not\vdash \phi$ and $\Gamma\not\vdash\neg\phi$. From here it arises many saying, primarily from popular science literature, blog posts or some websites, and they're all different: (some of their description is rather ambiguous and nonrigorous, I keep their original statement as possible, but rephrasing it more uniformly.)</p>

<ol>
<li>It means that there exists a sentence $\psi$ that doesn't have a truth value(i.e., neither true nor false.)</li>
<li>It means that there exists a sentence $\psi$ having a truth value, but we don't know.</li>
<li>It means that there exists a true sentence $\psi$, but $\Gamma\not\vdash \psi$ and $\Gamma\not\vdash\neg\psi$. (ps: this saying is so blurred, how does ""true"" mean by him? Under what model? Under all model?)</li>
<li>There exists sentence $\psi$ such that $\Gamma\not\vdash \psi$ and $\Gamma\not\vdash\neg\psi$, and there exists some model $\mathfrak{A}$ such that $\mathfrak{A}\vDash\Gamma$ and $V_{\mathfrak{A}}(\psi)=T$, and at the same time there also exist some model $\mathfrak{B}$ such that $\mathfrak{B}\vDash\Gamma$ and $V_{\mathfrak{B}}(\psi)=F$.</li>
<li>There exists sentence $\psi$ such that $\Gamma\not\vdash \psi$ and $\Gamma\not\vdash\neg\psi$, and for any model $\mathfrak{A}$ that $\mathfrak{A}\vDash\Gamma$, then $V_{\mathfrak{A}}(\psi)=T$.</li>
<li>... (there are more than these, but I think I may stop listing at here)</li>

<p>Which point of view above is correct? And what does Godel's incompleteness really said? What conclusion and observation we can make by the theorem?</p>

<hr>

<p>Let me explain a bit of my background, Topology is the area of mathematics that I enjoy doing the most by far, with regards to the books I've read, I've gone through <em>most</em> of the first 300 pages of <em>Topology: A First Course by Munkres</em> (I still have a few things after Seperation Axioms and stuff to go through). I've also read a bit of Willard's General Topology</p>

<p>I'm currently studying Algebraic Topology and Differential Topology (and Differential Geometry) on my own, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it, but currently it seems that Algebraic Topology and Differential Topology, don't use that much General Topology apart from Compactness, Connectedness and the basics. I've yet to see (in my limited knowledge of Alg and Diff Topology) any real use of things like Separation Axioms and deeper theory from General Topology.</p>

<p>E.g for Differential Topology if your topological space $M$ is second countable and Haursdoff, then you're good to go. </p>

<p>While I certainly have a <strong>lot</strong> more Differential Topology and Algebraic Topology to learn  (and I look forward to it), I also feel like I should learn a bit more of General Topology.</p>

<p>The reason I've given this long explanation (because I hope it will also help others studying Topology who have similarities), is because the path most Topology students follow is the following</p>

<p>$$\text{General Topology} \to \text{Algebraic Topology/Differential Topology}$$</p>

<p>in which one would usually read <em>Topology A First Course by Munkres</em> or a similar intro to general topology book, then follow that with something like <em>Algebraic Topology by Hatcher</em> and <em>Differential Topology by Guillemin and Pollack</em> and Milnors <em>Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now (finally) onto my two questions. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I want to broaden my knowledge of General Topology, what book do I go to next after Munkres? Should I learn some Pointfree Topology (Frame Theory)?. Also I should mention that I <em>don't</em> want to specialize in General Topology.</p></li>
<li><p>I hope to someday specialize in Algebraic Topology or Differential Topology/Differential Geometry, so would learning more about General Topology have any <em>direct</em> benefit to my studies of these subjects?</p></li>

"2381072","2381078","PDF of angle between normally distributed position vector and fixed unit vector in 2D vs 3D-space","<p>I'm not a mathematician. But I came across a math-related question while trying to prove something in Python. So I hope that I'm fine posting over here.</p>

<p>I get a different distribution for the 2D &amp; the 3D-case when I look at the angles between a vector that is normally distributed around another vector and I don't know if that is supposed to happen or not or I did do something wrong here.</p>

<p>I can explain the 2D case to me but not the 3D case</p>

<p><strong>2D Case:</strong></p>

<p>First I look at 2D Space in cartesian x, y-coordinates with a unit-vector 
$\vec{x}=\array(1,0)$</p>

<p>Now I want $n$ vectors that are normally distributed around $\vec{x}$.</p>

<p>In Python I do this with:</p>

<p>$n=10000$</p>

<p>$vX=np.random.normal(1, 0.02, size=n)$</p>

<p>$vY=np.random.normal(0, 0.02, size=n)$</p>

<p>$\vec{v}=(vX, vY)$</p>

<p>So if I now with the help of the dot-product look at all the angles between x and v I get a distribution that looks like this:</p>

<p>$\phi=\arccos\left(\frac{\vec{x}\cdot\vec{v}}{|\vec{x}|\cdot|\vec{v}|}\right)$</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/ueeKxbp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://imgur.com/ueeKxbp</a></p>

<p>Which is totally what I expect since the randomly distributed vector $\vec{v}$ is centered around $\vec{x}$ and thus the most probable angle is $0°$.</p>

<p><strong>3D Case:</strong></p>

<p>If I switch to the 3D case now I just add 1 dimension to the vectors with the unit-vector being
$\vec{x}=\array(1,0,0)$
and the normally distributed vector being</p>

<p>$vX=np.random.normal(1, 0.02, size=n)$</p>

<p>$vY=np.random.normal(0, 0.02, size=n)$</p>

<p>$vZ=np.random.normal(0, 0.02, size=n)$</p>

<p>$\vec{v}=(vX, vY, vZ)$</p>

<p>Then I calculate the angle between the random vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{x}$ again and get the following distribution.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/0LOEMit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://imgur.com/0LOEMit</a></p>

<p>I can't imagine now why the most probable angle is <strong>not</strong> $0°$ anymore and this doesn't make sense to me since the vector $\vec{v}$ (in my imagination) is still centered around $\vec{x}$.</p>

<p>I don't want a hard mathematical proof here in case my result is true but in this case would be very pleased if it can be explained in layman-terms.</p>

<p>I hope that my question is clear.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Some insights:</strong>
The first passenger always arrive at $t=0$ (we always know). When the timer of 15 minutes duration is started, the rest of passengers follow Poisson distribution. If no (more) passenger arrives in this time with probability i.e., $p_{0}$ calculated according to Poisson PMF, it means the bus will take the only first passenger and the first is also the last passenger. The expected time of waiting of the last would be $p_{0} * 15$ min. Similarly, 1,2,3... more passengers can arrive in $(0,10$ min$]$ with probabilities $p_{1}$, $p_{2}$, $p_{3}$, etc.,
But I should multiply with which time as of course this should be less than 15 minutes, as I multiplied the $p_{0}$ with 15 minutes?</p>

"2381146","2381992","A mathematical problem which shall be linear algebra","<p>I was trying to solve one of the famous H.

<p>After dinner, the five boys of a household happened to find a parcel of sugar-plums. It was quite unexpected loot, and an exciting scramble ensued, the full details of which I will recount with accuracy, as it forms an interesting puzzle.</p>

<p>You see, Andrew managed to get possession of just two-thirds of the parcel of sugar-plums. Bob at once grabbed three-eighths of these, and Charlie managed to seize three-tenths also. Then young David dashed upon the scene, and captured all that Andrew had left, except one-seventh, which Edgar artfully secured for himself by a cunning trick. Now the fun began in real earnest, for Andrew and Charlie jointly set upon Bob, who stumbled against the fender and dropped half of all that he had, which were equally picked up by David and Edgar, who had crawled under a table and were waiting. Next, Bob sprang on Charlie from a chair, and upset all the latter's collection on to the floor. Of this prize Andrew got just a quarter, Bob Pg 20gathered up one-third, David got two-sevenths, while Charlie and Edgar divided equally what was left of that stock.</p>

<p>They were just thinking the fray was over when David suddenly struck out in two directions at once, upsetting three-quarters of what Bob and Andrew had last acquired. The two latter, with the greatest difficulty, recovered five-eighths of it in equal shares, but the three others each carried off one-fifth of the same. Every sugar-plum was now accounted for, and they called a truce, and divided equally amongst them the remainder of the parcel. What is the smallest number of sugar-plums there could have been at the start, and what proportion did each boy obtain?</p>

<p><strong>answer</strong></p>

<p>The smallest number of sugar plums that will fulfil the conditions is 26,880. The five boys obtained respectively: Andrew, 2,863; Bob, 6,335; Charlie, 2,438; David, 10,294; Edgar, 4,950. There is a little trap concealed in the words near the end, ""one-fifth of the same,"" that seems at first sight to upset the whole account of the affair. But a little thought will show that the words could only mean ""one-fifth of five-eighths"", the fraction last mentioned—that is, one-eighth of the three-quarters that Bob and Andrew had last acquired.</p>

<p>$$L(\mathbf{x},\lambda)=f(\mathbf{x})-\lambda \left(g(\mathbf{x})-C\right)$$</p>

-\left(g(\mathbf{x})-C\right) \\
\end{bmatrix}
=0
$$</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>.<br />
I believe gradients of Lagrangian are equal to 0 because we want to find a point(s) $\mathbf{x}_{\,0}$ for which gradients are proportional, having the same direction. I followed a couple of theory explanations and cannot figure out why we want gradients to have the same direction, why do we look for a ""point"" where gradients are proportional. If I add multiple constraints, each constraint add its own gradient, how do we find ""the point of the same gradient"" when we have multiple gradients from different constraints?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>.<br />
Also, I tried a very trivial example and I failed to understand its output. I guess it is because I don't fully understand how to apply constraints using Lagrange Multipliers. For instance:</p>

<p>$f(x)=(x-1)(x-5)=x^2-6x+5 \\
g(x)=x-3 \\
L(x)=x^2-6x+5 - \lambda (x-3) \\
$</p>

<p>This is a parabola and I was looking for max value. If I don't apply constraint, max of this function is in infinity! I tried to apply a line $g(x)=x-3$ as a constraint. I build the Lagrangian, calculated its derivatives and have everything equal to 0, I have following result:  </p>

<p>$\begin{cases}
\frac{\mathrm dL(x)}{\mathrm d x} = 2x-6-\lambda = 0\\
\frac{\mathrm dL(x)}{\mathrm d \lambda} = x-3 = 0\\
\end{cases}$</p>

<p>This is awkward because the first and the second equations are the same if I don't have lambda. Also, substituting second to the first cause $\lambda=0$. When I draw parabola and the line, I have two points of intersection. I don't know why the Lagrange Multiplier doesn't work here, giving me a point $x_0 \approx 5.5$.</p>

"2381183","2381798","Determining the geometry of an arc segment from two known points and a curvature","<p><strong>Short version:</strong> How do i determine the profile of arc segment from two known points and curvature of the arc?</p>

<p><strong>Long version:</strong> As an intro into modelling co-rotating twin-screw extruders i am trying to learn how the profiles of the screws are determined. For those of you who don't know, twin-screw extruders are machines which have two screws intermeshed in such a way that the action of a flight of one screw wipes the root of the other screw alternately. The below image shows the intermeshing of the screw (left) and the self-wiping action in a frontview perspective (right):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LxBtT.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LxBtT.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/73fn1m.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/73fn1m.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>For this self-wiping action, the screw needs a special geometry determined by a special set of rules.</p>

<p>In the analysis i am following 
<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1098-2329(199622)15:2%3C127::AID-ADV2%3E3.0.CO;2-X/abstract"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The geometry of self-cleaning twin-screw extruders</a> by C. Rauwendaal.
The basic geometric properties of the barrel:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VYa4nm.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VYa4nm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7lX4em.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7lX4em.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>where $\alpha_i$ is the intermesh angle, $I_h$ is the intermesh height, $C_l$ is the centerline distance and finally $D$ and $D_r$ are the screw and root diameter respectively. For a given screw diameter $D$, these are related through some geometric considerations:
$$\frac{C_l}{D}=\cos\left(\frac{\alpha_i}{2}\right) \qquad
\frac{I_h}{D} = \frac{1}{2}\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}\alpha_i\right) \qquad
\frac{D_r}{D} = 2\frac{C_l}{D}-1$$
which basically implies that chosing an intermesh angle $\alpha_i$ fixes the centerline distance $C_l$, the intermesh height $I_h$ and the root diameter $D_r$.</p>

<p>Due to symmetry only a quarter of a screw needs to be examined. Such a quarter is further divisible into three sections:</p>

<ol>
<li>the tip -> $0&lt;\alpha\leq\alpha_t/2$, </li>
<li>the flank -> $\alpha_t/2&lt;\alpha\leq\alpha_t/2+\alpha_f$</li>
<li>the root -> $\alpha_t/2+\alpha_f&lt;\alpha\leq\alpha_t/2+\alpha_f+\alpha_r/2$</li>
</ol>

<p>where $\alpha$ is the angle from the horizontal, $\alpha_t$ is the tip angle, $\alpha_f$ is the flank angle, $\alpha_r$ is the root angle. As the two screws have the same cross-sectional shape, the root angle should equal the tip angle. Furthermore, the sum of the tip angle, root angle and flank angle should be:
$$\frac{\alpha_r}{2}+\alpha_f+\frac{\alpha_t}{2}=\frac{\pi}{2}$$
Given the assumption $\alpha_r=\alpha_t$ as discussed above, this yields for the tip angle:
$$\alpha_t=\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha_f$$</p>

<p>For the case of co-rotating screws, it is given that the flank angle has to be equal to the intermesh angle, i.e. $\alpha_f = \alpha_i$. From this follows then the tip angle $\alpha_t$ and the root angle $\alpha_r$.</p>

<p>Having determined all these geometric properties, I would now like to be able to reconstruct the profile of the screw. Taking the center of the screw as the origin $O$, the root and tip of the screw are easily described as they have constant radii with respect to $O$. However, the flank area with respect to $O$ has a variable radius which ranges from $\frac{D_r}{2}$ at the root angle to $\frac{D}{2}$ at the tip angle. In other words:</p>

<p>$$r = \begin{cases}
\frac{D}{2} &amp; 0\leq\alpha&lt;\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{t}\\
R\left(\alpha\right) &amp; \frac{1}{2}\alpha_{t}\leq\alpha&lt;\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{t}+\alpha_{f}\\
\frac{D_{r}}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{2}\alpha_{t}+\alpha_{f}\leq\alpha&lt;\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{t}+\alpha_{f}+\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{r}
\end{cases}$$</p>

<p>However, in the article it is given that the shape of the flank is determined by an arc of a circle (with a different unknown origin $C$) with radius $C_l$. </p>

<p>What i would like to know is how I can determine the profile described by $R\left(\alpha\right)$ which is basically an arc segment between two points (i.e. $[r,\alpha]=[D/2, \alpha_t/2]$ and $[r,\alpha]=[D_r/2, \alpha_t/2+\alpha_f]$) with known curvature (radius $C_l$)?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The answer of @ja27 gives a good and easy geometric method of constructing the arc in question:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/S9Nlr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/S9Nlr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>However, as stated in the question (although maybe not clearly enough), I would like to be to describe the arc segment in terms of origin $O$ and angle $\alpha$ through function $R(\alpha)$, rather than origin $C$ and angle $\theta$.</p>

"2381190","2381274","Differentiating the binomial theorem","<p>The standard identity 
$$
n2^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^n k\binom{n}{k}
$$
has an easy combinatorial interpretation, which is that both sides count the number of ways to pick a subset of $[n]$ with a marked element.  Alternatively, we could look at
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x+1)^n = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}x^k\right)
$$
and then substitute $x=1$ to get the same identity.  We can think of this as differentiating moving between counting sets and counting ""pointed"" sets, which is what we did above without the analytic machinery.  This is a specific instance of a fact about generating functions.</p>

<p>If instead we look at 
$$
\frac{d^n}{dx^n}(e^x - 1) = \frac{d^n}{dx^n}\left(
  \sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}(-1)^{n-k}e^{kx}
\right)
$$
and substitute $x=0$ we get another well-known identity (a special case 
of the inclusion-exclusion formula for the number of surjections)
$$
  n! = \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{n-k}\binom{n}{k}k^n
$$
My question is whether this derivation is an example of a more general technique or has some meaning.  I'm not that good at generating functions, so it seems a little mysterious.</p>

<p>Proof. It is enough to show \begin{equation}\mu(A)\geq \mu(A\cap C)+\mu(A\setminus C)
\end{equation}
for all closed sets $C$ and arbitrary sets $A\subset \mathbb{R}^n.$ Because this is obviously true for sets with $\mu(A)=+\infty $ we may wlog assume $\mu(A)&lt;+\infty$. Define the sets $C_n:=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n: dist(x,C)\leq \frac{1}{n}\}$. Due to \begin{equation}
\mu(A\setminus C_n)+\mu(A\cap C)=\mu(A\setminus C_n \cup A\cap C)\leq\mu(B),\end{equation}
as $dist(A\setminus C_n, A\cap C)&gt;\frac{1}{n}&gt;0$, it is sufficient to prove $\lim_{n\to \infty}\mu(A\setminus C_n)=\mu(A\setminus C).$
To see this set $R_k:=A\cap (C_k\setminus C_{k+1}).$ Then $A\setminus C=(A\setminus C_k) \cup R_k \cup R_{k+1}\cup ... $ and therefore
\begin{equation}\mu(A\setminus C_n)\leq \mu (A\setminus C)\leq \mu(A\setminus C_n)+\sum_{i=n}^\infty \mu(R_i).
\end{equation}
If $\sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu(R_i)&lt;\infty$ taking the limit and using the last inequality would finish the proof. Observe that $ dist(R_i,R_j)&gt;0$ for $ |i-j|\geq 2$. Therefore, by using the assumption on $\mu$ we get \begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu(R_i)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu(R_{2i})+\sum_{i=0}^\infty \mu(R_{2i+1})=\mu(R_2\cup R_4\cup ...)+\mu(R_1\cup R_3\cup...)\leq 2\mu(A)&lt;\infty,
\end{equation}
which finishes the proof.</p>

<p>My question is now the following: Where is it used in the proof that (C) is closed or why does this proof doesn't work for all sets (C)? Apart from that the proof makes perfect sense to me.</p>

In finding the domain, I first noted that $x+2x^2 + 3x^3 + ... = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} nx^n$, which is just the derivative of the geometric series, which has the domain (interval of convergence) of $(-1,1)$, and diverges outside the interval.

<p>This is the correct answer. However, the solution in the back of the books seems unnecessarily complex.

"2381501","2381581","Subobject of an element in a category","<p>I am trying to understand what is a subobject of an element $A$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$. I am reading English translation <strong>some aspects of homological algebra</strong> of ""Sur quelques points d'algèbre homologique"" by Alexander Grothendieck.</p>

<p>Discussion goes as follows :</p>

<p>Given monomorphisms $u:B\rightarrow A$ and  $u':B'\rightarrow A$, we say $u'$ majorizes $u$ and write $u\leq u'$ if $u$ factors through $u'$ i.e., there exists $v:B\rightarrow B'$ such that $B\xrightarrow{v}B'\xrightarrow{u'}A$ is the map $u:B\rightarrow A$.</p>

<p>We say $u,u'$ are equivalent if $u\leq u',u'\leq u$ and $v:B\rightarrow B'$
and $v':B'\rightarrow B$ are inverses of each other.</p>

<p>Then he says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>choose one monomorphism in each class of equivalent monomorphisms, the selected monomorphims will be called the subobjects of $A$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This equivalenece relation partitions the collection of all monomorphisms. Suppose $u'$ majorizes $u$ but $u$ does not majorize $u'$ then $u$ will not be in the equivalence class of $u'$ but $u$ will be in another equivalence class which it represents and this will be then called a subobject too. This seems absurd.</p>

  <p><strong>Theorem :</strong> There is no computer algorithm that will accept any algorithm X and data set D as input and then will output ""halts"" or ""loops forever"" to indicate whether or not X terminates in a finite number of steps when X is run with data set D.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Proof :</strong> Suppose there is an algorithm, call it CheckHalt, such that if an algorithm X and a data set D are input, then CheckHalt prints ""halts"" if X terminates in a finite number of steps when run with the data set D or ""loops forever"" if X does notterminate in a finite number of steps when run with data set D.</p>
  
  <p><em>Now next lines are those which I don't understand in this proof</em></p>
  
  <p>Observe that the sequence of characters making up an algorithm X can be regarded as a data set itself. Thus it is possible to consider running a CheckHalt with input (X,X).</p>

<p>So I have understood that CheckHalt essentially gets input as an algorithm X and a data set D. It tells whether if we run the algorithm X with that data set D as it's (X's) input, then X will halt or loop forever. Thus CheckHalt(X,D) seems good.</p>

<p>My question is how can an algorithm X have an input X itself i.e how can we call an algorithm as a data set?</p>

<p>The first proof was simple and I accomplished it. Because it is too lengthy I am not going to write it down(definition of Vector space).</p>

<p>I was able to prove $D\langle \Phi,Y\rangle=\langle D\Phi,Y\rangle+\langle \Phi,DY\rangle=\langle (D+Q^t)\Phi,Y\rangle$.</p>

<p>First I recalled the product derivative rule $(f(x)g(x))´=f(x)´g(x)+f(x)g(x)´$.
Since $\langle \Phi,Y\rangle=\varphi_1y_1+...+\varphi_ny_n$ is assumed.</p>

<p>We have $D\langle \Phi,Y\rangle=D(\varphi_1y_1+...+\varphi_ny_n)=(\varphi_1y_1+...+\varphi_ny_n)´=\\\varphi_1´y_1+\varphi_1y_1´+...+\varphi_n´y_n+\varphi_ny_n´=\langle D\Phi,Y\rangle+\langle \Phi,DY\rangle$</p>

<p>Now that we have, by assumption we know $Y´=QY$</p>

<p>$\langle D\Phi,Y\rangle+\langle \Phi,DY\rangle=\langle D\Phi,Y\rangle+\langle \Phi,QY\rangle=\langle D\Phi,Y\rangle+\langle Q^t\Phi,Y\rangle=\langle (D+Q^t)\Phi,Y\rangle$</p>

"2381538","2382099","Diagonalizability via forms","<p>Bored at a lecture, I began tinkering with 2-by-2 matrices and observed the following. Suppose we want to diagonalize the matrix $$\begin{pmatrix}a &amp; b\\c &amp; d\end{pmatrix}$$ in the most naive way possible. 
We seek a matrix $$\begin{pmatrix}\alpha &amp; \beta \\ \gamma &amp; \delta \end{pmatrix}$$ with $\alpha\delta - \beta\gamma \ne 0$ such that 
$$\frac{1}{\alpha\delta - \beta\gamma} \begin{pmatrix} \delta &amp; -\beta \\ -\gamma &amp; \alpha \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}a &amp; b\\c &amp; d\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}\alpha &amp; \beta \\ \gamma &amp; \delta \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}* &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; *\end{pmatrix}.$$
Grinding through the algebra, it turns out that the off-diagonal terms are $Q(\alpha, \gamma)$ and $-Q(\beta, \delta)$, up to a scalar multiple, where $$Q(x, y) = cx^2 + (a-d)xy - by^2.$$
So to find a diagonalizing matrix, we seek solutions to $Q(x, y) = 0$.
Because $Q$ is homogeneous, we are actually seeking solutions in $\mathbb{P}^1$. The condition $\alpha\delta - \beta\gamma \ne 0$ is equivalent to $$[\alpha:\gamma] \ne [\beta:\delta].$$
This viewpoint is totally new to me. For $n$-by-$n$ matrices, are there analogous homogeneous forms coming from trying to diagonalize in this way? </p>

"2381554","2381572","Universal first countability in ZF?","<p>It's easy to come up with examples of spaces which are provably-in-ZFC not first countable: e.g. the order topology on $\omega_1+1$, or the cocountable topology on any uncountable set. However, these proofs tend to rely on principles of the form ""every 'small' union of 'small' sets is 'small',"" and <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02760939"" rel=""noreferrer"">these can fail quite badly without choice</a>.</p>

<p>Conversely, at the other end of things, if we extend ZF by a strong <em>anti</em>-choice principle, we can often get provably non-first-countable spaces. For example, the cofinite topology on an amorphous set $A$ is non-first-countable. </p>

<p><em>Why? Pick $a\in A$, and consider a sequence $(U_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ of neighborhoods of $a$. The union of the complements of the $U_i$s must not be finite in order for the sequence to witness first countability. Let $V_i$ be the set of points ""thrown out for the first time"" at stage $i$: that is, $V_i$ is the set of $y$ such that $y\not\in U_i$ but $y\in \bigcup_{j&lt;i} U_j$. Infinitely many of the $V_i$s must be nonempty; WLOG suppose each $V_i$ is nonempty. But then $\bigcup_{i\in\mathbb{N}}V_{2i}$ and $\bigcup_{i\in\mathbb{N}}V_{2i+1}$ are two disjoint infinite subsets of $A$.</em></p>

<p>So my question is whether we can find non-first-countable spaces in ZF alone. Phrased most simply, this is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does ZF prove that there are non-first-countable spaces?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can also ask a question which might be a bit more satisfying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a formula $\varphi$ which ZF proves defines a non-first-countable topological space?</p>

<p>Let $E$ denote a real Banach space and $[a,b]$ be an interval of the real line.</p>

$$
\lim_{s \downarrow t} \frac{f(s) - f(t)}{s - t} = \D_\r f|_t

exists ($s \downarrow t$ represents convergence from above).  </p>

<p>Here is the problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prove theat if $f$ is right-differentiable at $t$ then the function $g = \| f \|$ is also right-differentiable at $t$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My proof goes:</p>

<p>By definition of right-differentiability and convergence in Banach space it follows that</p>

<p>$$
0 = \lim_{s \downarrow t} \frac{\| f(s) - f(t) -\D_\r f |_t (s -t) \|}{s - t}
$$
which along with the fact that in any normed space $\| x - y \| \ge | \|x\| - \|y\| |$ provides
$$
(1) \quad 0 \ge \lim_{s \downarrow t} \frac{\Big| \|f(s)\| -\|f(t) +\D_\r f|_t(s - t)\|   \Big|}{s - t} \ge^*
\inf_{u \in \mathbb{R}} \lim_{s \downarrow t}
\frac{\Big| g(s) - g(t) - u(s - t)  \Big|}{s -t} \ge 0.
$$
Last expression must be equal  to zero as it clearly non-negative. Now we want to show that minimizer $u$ exists:
$$
 \lim_{s \downarrow t}\frac {| g(s) - g(t) | } {s -t} \le \lim_{s \downarrow t} \frac{\| f(s) - f(t) \|}{s - t} = \| \D_\r f|_t  \|
$$
by continuity of the norm. Hence we can safely minimize over compact interval $\Big[
-\| \D_\r f|_t \|, \| \D_r f |_t \| \Big]$ which shows that minimizer $u$ exists. This shows that $g$ has right differential $u$ at $t$. $\square$</p>

<p>I have a problem with $(\ge^*)$ transition in (1). it seems to be right,
but I son't know how to handle transition from $\| f(t) + \D_\r f|_t(s -t) \| $ to $ g(t) + \D_\r g |_t$. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assume $c$ is a solution to $x^3-9=0$ in $(\mathbb{Z}/31 \mathbb{Z})$.
  We then have $$c^3-9=0\implies c^3=9 \implies |c^3|=|9|$$ and since on
  the LHS we're multiplying elements in $(\mathbb{Z}/31 \mathbb{Z})$, we
  consider the order of $[9]_{31}$ in $(\mathbb{Z}/31 \mathbb{Z})^*$
  which is $15$ since $$9^{15} \equiv 1 \ \text{mod} \ 31.$$ Thus
  $|c^3|=15$.</p>

<p>I feel like I should be able to deduce $|c|$ from $|c^3|$ but it doesn't seem to be clear to me. Could someone assist me in figuring out how to get $|c|$? </p>

<p>From there, my next steps would be to ensure it divides $31$. Since $(\mathbb{Z}/31 \mathbb{Z})^*$ is abelian and cyclic thus has an element of maximal finite order of $31$, and if $|c| \leq 31$ then $|c|$ must divide $31.$</p>

<p>I assume the problem is related to the speed of sound. After each second, the sound waves travel behind the horse and reach him almost instantly at the beginning, but after his speed is >340 m/sec (speed of sound) the waves of sound are travelling behind him but never reach him, since the horse is faster. After the first meter, the bell rings and travels 1m in 1/340 sec, but during this time (1/340 sec) the horse has advanced 1/340 m, so the horse will hear it in 341/340 seconds after he started running. Then at this point he doubles his speed. Any ideas about the final equation? We also know that he runs at 1-meter jumps so if he hears the bell after 1/340 sec, it does not matter, as this will affect his motion only at the next jump, right?</p>

Clones are significant because for any language of possible operations on $A$, the functions definable from those operations is a clone.</p>

<p><strong>Is it true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ that there are only finitely many clones containing all constant functions?</strong> That is, for each $a \in A$ the clone contains a function $f: A \to A$, such that $f(x) = a$ for all $x$.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>The classic case is where $A = \{0,1\}$; a set of functions is ""expressively adequate"" if it generates the clone of all functions. It is a famous and fundamental result that sets such as $\{\lor, \lnot\}$ and $\{\to, \bot\}$ are expressively adequate. A more powerful and incredibly beautiful result is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%27s_lattice"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Post's lattice</a> which completely characterizes ALL countably many possible clones on $\{0,1\}$. Wikipedia states: ""the lattice of clones on a three-element (or larger) set [has] the cardinality of the continuum, and a complicated inner structure.""</p>

<p>But I have an alternate definition of expressive adequacy in mind where we wish to always allow constants $0$ and $1$. Thus we restrict to those clones containing the constant functions, and we find that there are only <em>finitely many</em> clones on $\{0,1\}$. In fact, there are 7 clones:</p>

<ul>
<li>$UM$, which contains just constant functions and projections</li>
<li>$\Lambda$, the set of conjunctive functions</li>
<li>$V$, the set of disjunctive functions</li>
<li>$U$, the set of essentially unary functions (depend only one one coordinate)</li>
<li>$A$, the set of affine functions</li>
<li>$M$, the set of monotone functions</li>
<li>$\top$, all functions.</li>

</blockquote>

<p>Is there a way to fix the following proof? First note that it is easy to prove that $\det( \begin{bmatrix} P &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; I \\ \end{bmatrix}) = \det(P)$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be those invertible matrices such that $PAQ = D$, where $D$ is a diagonal matrix having amount of $1$'s along its diagonal equal to rank of $A$. Then </p>

<p>$$ \det(M) = \det(\begin{bmatrix} A &amp; B \\ 0 &amp; I \\ \end{bmatrix})$$</p>

<p>$$= \det(\begin{bmatrix} P^{-1}DQ^{-1} &amp; B \\ 0 &amp; I \\ \end{bmatrix})$$</p>

<p>$$=\det(P^{-1}) \det(\begin{bmatrix} D &amp; PB \\ 0 &amp; I \\ \end{bmatrix}) \det(Q^{-1})$$</p>

<p>Since the middle determinant is clearly the determinant of an upper triangular matrix, it will be product of $D$'s diagonal elements and $I$'s elements; i.e., $\det(P^{-1}) \det(D) \det(Q^{-1}) = \det(P^{-1}DQ^{-1}) = \det(A)$, which proves the theorem.</p>

<p>Okay. I realize I am being rather fast and loose with the dimension of the matrices. I am trying to avoid as much induction as possible; so far as I can tell, the only thing that needs to be proven through induction is $\det( \begin{bmatrix} P &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; I \\ \end{bmatrix}) = \det(P)$ My only problem is that $PB$ may not be defined, but I am hoping that this doesn't prove t be an insuperable problem for my proof. </p>

"2381791","2381848","Passing Shillings","<p>I am trying to solve one of Carroll's pillow problems, but even with the solution I can't really graps it.</p>

<p>The problem is as follow</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some men sat in a circle, so that each had 2 neighbours; and each had
  a certain number of shillings.  The first had I/ more than the second,
  who had I/ more than the third, and so on.  The first gave I/ to the
  second, who gave 2/ to the third, and so on, each giving I/ more than
  he received, as long as possible.  There were then 2 neighbors, one of
  whom had 4 times as much as the other.  How many men were there?  And
  how much had the poorest man at first?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is the given solution</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let m = No. of men, k = No. of shillings possessed by the last (i.e.
  the poorest) man. After one circuit, each is a shilling poorer, and
  the moving heap contains m shgs. Hence, after k circuits, each is k
  shillings poorer, the last man now having nothing, and the moving heap
  contains mk shillings. Hence the thing ends when the last man is again
  called on to hand on the heap, which then contains (mk + m − 1)
  shillings, the penultimate man now having nothing, and the first man
  having (m − 2) shillings.</p>
  
  <p>It is evident that that the first and last man are the only 2
  neighbours whose possessions can be in the ratio ‘4 to 1’. Hence
  either</p>

<pre><code>                             mk + m − 1 = 4(m − 2), 

                or else      4(mk + m − 1) = m − 2.
</code></pre>
  
  <p>The first equation gives mk = 3m − 7, i.e. k = 3 − 7m, which evidently
  gives no integral values other than m = 7, k = 2.</p>
  
  <p>The second gives 4mk = 2 − 3m, which evidently gives no positive
  integral values.</p>
  
  <p>Hence the answer is ‘7 men; 2 shillings’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am having trouble understanding starting from when he says that <strong><em>the thing ends when the last man is again called on to hand on the heap</em></strong>, and then I can't follow the other equations.</p>

<p>Original Question </p>

<p>Here is my proof,</p>

<p>Suppose that f(x) has no local extrema on (a, b).</p>

<p>Thus, f(x) is monotonic on (a, b), /* <strong>Question 1: Is this true</strong>? */</p>

<p>Therefore, $f^{'}(a)f^{'}(b)&gt;0$, /* <strong>Question 2: Is this true</strong>? */</p>

<p>which contradicts the fact that $f^{'}(a)f^{'}(b)&lt;0$.</p>

<p>Then, there exists at least one extremum on (a, b) and that point is $\xi$. Thus, $f^{'}(\xi)=0$.</p>

<p><strong>Overall, my question is that if a function is derivable on [a, b] and monotonic on (a, b), can we say anything about the left or right hand derivatives at the end point?</strong></p>

"2381981","2382525","Covering Dimension of a Subset of the Plane","<p>I am proving the equivalence of a few statements, and I'm stuck on one of them.
I want to show that: If $K \subset [0,1]\times[0,1]$ is a non-degenerate continuum with empty interior, then $K$ has covering dimension $1$.
(By a continuum, I mean a compact, connected, metric space. In this context, it is equivalent to a closed connected subset of $[0,1]\times[0,1]$.)</p>

<p>Outline of attempted proof:
Let $K \subset [0,1]\times[0,1]$ be a non-degenerate continuum. Suppose $K$ has empty interior. Show that dim $K$ ≠ $0$. Show that dim $K$ ≠ $2$. We already know dim $K \leq$ dim $[0,1]$ + dim $[0,1]$ = $2$. Hence this shows that dim $K$ = $1$.</p>

<p>We know $K$ has empty interior and is closed. This means $K$ = $\partial K$. As $K$ is non-degenerate, it contains at least two points $a, b$. Suppose (with a view to contradiction) that it has dimension $0$. Then every open cover has a refinement with order at most $1$ - in other words, each open cover has a refinement such that all sets in it have empty intersection. Consider an open cover $\{U_n\}$ so that $a \in U_i, b \in U_j, i≠j$ and $a,b$ are not in any of the other sets in the cover. Now consider a refinement with order $1$. The existence of this refinement demonstrates that $a$ and $b$ are not connected, so $K$ is not a continuum. Thus dim $K$ ≠ $0$.</p>

<p>However, I am stuck on the second step. I'm unable to prove that the dimension of $K$ is not equal to $2$. Any help will be appreciated!</p>

<p>(If someone knows a theorem of a more general case, or results about dimension theory in Euclidean space, that would be fantastic! What I'm really after is the result, so a reference to a theorem or corollary in a book that directly proves my result is just as useful as an answer that contains a proof.)</p>

I am trying to understand which of these manifolds have almost complex structures and the  space of almost complex structures on such manifolds.  </p>

<p>The smooth type of these manifolds is determined by the framing of the $n$-handle. This is a torsor over $\pi_{n-1}(O(n))$, i.e., if we fix an initial framing, the other framings come about by multiplying by $\pi_{n-1}(O(n))$. There is a unique almost complex structure on the ball $B^{2n}$. In our fixed initial framing, this almost complex structure represents an element $\alpha \in \pi_{n-1}(O(2n)/U(n))$. 
The disk bundle obtained using this initial framing has an almost complex structure if $\alpha\in \pi_{n-1}(O(2n)/U(n))$ vanishes. 
When we change the framing by $\beta \in \pi_{n-1}(O(n))$, the resulting almost complex structure represents $\beta \alpha \beta^{-1} \in \pi_{n-1}(O(2n)/U(n))$; here we consider the image of $\beta$ in $\pi_{n-1}(O(2n))$ by the inclusion $O(n) \hookrightarrow O(2n)$ and act on $\alpha$ by conjugation; this is just the change of basis formula. The new disk bundle represented by $\beta$ will have an almost complex structure if 
$\beta \alpha \beta^{-1} \in \pi_{n-1}(O(2n)/U(n))$ vanishes. 
Has the conjugation action on homotopy groups been calculated? (More generally, what is the group structure on $\pi_k(O(n))$ coming from multiplication of matrices?) More precisely, for what $\beta$ do $\beta \alpha \beta^{-1} \in \pi_{n-1}(O(2n)/U(n))$  vanish? </p>

<p>Hence the existence of an almost complex structure on the disk bundle seems to depend on the smooth type of the bundle. Is this correct? 
However if an almost complex structure exists, then all almost complex structures are related by $\pi_n(O(2n)/U(n))$, which is independent of the smooth type. </p>

<p>I postulate that $f(z) = \frac{g(z)}{z(z - 2)}$, with $g$ being an everywhere-analytic function. The integrals can be used to show that $g(0) = g(2) = \frac{i}{\pi}$, since $\text{Res}(f, 0) = \frac{g(0)}{0 - 2} = -\frac{1}{2}g(0)$, $\int_{|z| = 1} f(z) dz = 2\pi i \text{Res}(f, 0) = 1$, and $\int_{|z| = 3} f(z) dz = 2\pi i (\text{Res}(f, 0) + \text{Res}(f, 2)) = 0 \iff \text{Res}(f, 0) = -\text{Res}(f, 2)$. Together these suggest the value of $g(0)$ and $g(2)$, after some algebra.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>(i) Are $(1)$ and $(2)$ equivalent for totally ordered sets? (Yes?)</p>

<p>(ii) For partially ordered sets in general, does $(1)$ imply $(2)$? (No?)</p>

<p>Attempt: In fact I think I gave myself an answer already but I googled online and no one is talking about this (Too trivial perhaps?). That's why I ask this question here. Here is the summary of my ""answer"" and you may give me a writing critique if you had time :)</p>

<hr>

<p>(i) $(1)$ and $(2)$ are equivalent for totally ordered sets.</p>

<p>$(1) \Rightarrow (2)$: Since $f$ is injective, I found that $(1)$ is equivalent to
$$a_1\leq_A a_2 \implies f(a_1) \leq_B f(a_2) \tag{3}$$
Since $\leq_A, \leq_B$ are <em>total orders</em>, we can write the contrapositive of $(1)$ as</p>

<p>$$f(a_1) \geq_B f(a_2) \implies a_1 \geq_A a_2$$
Reordering the arrows and renaming $a_1$ and $a_2$,
$$f(a_1) \leq_B f(a_2)  \implies a_1 \leq_A a_2 \tag{4}$$</p>

<p>Combining $(3)$ and $(4)$, we get $(2)$. So we have $(1) \Rightarrow (2)$. And $(2)\Rightarrow (1)$ follows from $(3) \Leftrightarrow (1)$.</p>

<hr>

<p>(ii) No. If $a, b \in \Bbb{R}$, define 
$$a \preceq b \iff (a = b \text{ or } a \leq b-1) $$</p>

<p>We check that $\preceq$ is a partial order on $\Bbb{R}$:</p>

<p>(Reflexive) $\forall\ a \in \Bbb{R}$, $a= a \implies a \preceq a$.</p>

<p>(Transitive) Pick any $a, b ,c \in \Bbb{R}$. Suppose $a \preceq b$ and $b \preceq c$.</p>

<p>[Case 1]: $a = b$ and $b =c$. Then $a = c$. Then $a \preceq c$</p>

<p>[Case 2]: $a \leq b-1$ and $b = c$. Then $a \leq c -1$. Then $a \preceq c$</p>

<p>[Case 3]: $a = b$ and $b \leq c -1$. Then $a \leq c -1$. Then $a \preceq c$</p>

<p>[Case 4]: $a \leq b-1$ and $b \leq c - 1$. Then $a \leq b - 1 \leq c -2 \leq c-1$</p>

<p>(Antisymmetric) Pick any $a, b \in \Bbb{R}$. Suppose $a \preceq b$ and $b \preceq a$.</p>

<p>[Case 1]: $a = b$ and $b = a$. Then $a = b$.</p>

<p>[Case 2]: $a \leq b-1$ and $b = a$. Then $b \leq b -1$. This case cannot occur.</p>

<p>[Case 3]: $a = b$ and $b \leq a -1$. Then $a \leq a -1$. This case cannot occur.</p>

<p>[Case 4]: $a \leq b-1$ and $b \leq a - 1$. Then $a \leq b - 1 \leq a -2$. This case cannot occur.</p>

<p>Thus the only possibility is $a = b$.</p>

<p>Since $a\leq b-1 &lt; b$, the identity map $\text{Id}_\Bbb{R}: (\Bbb{R}, \preceq) \to (\Bbb{R}, \leq)$ is a bijective function satisfying $(1)$. </p>

<p>But $(2)$ is not satisfied. For example, $0&lt; 0.5$ but $\text{Id}_\Bbb{R}(0) = 0 \not \preceq 0.5 = \text{Id}_\Bbb{R}(0.5)$  </p>

<p>If $M\in \mathcal{L}(E)^+$ i.e. $\langle Mx\;| \;x\rangle\geq 0$ for all $x\in E$, then we can define a positive semi-definite sesquilinear form, as follow
\begin{eqnarray*}
              \langle\cdot\;|\;\cdot\rangle_{M}

<p>Note that $\langle .\;|\;.\rangle_M$ defines a semi-inner product on $E$, and the seminorm induced by it is given by
$$\|x\|_M=\langle x\;|\;x\rangle_M^{1/2}=\| M^{1/2}x\|,\;\;\forall\,x\in E.$$
We define the following subset
\begin{eqnarray*}
              W_M(T)
            &amp;=&amp;\{\langle T x\; |\;x\rangle_M:\;x \in E\;\;\hbox{and}\;\|x\|_M=1\}\\

              \end{eqnarray*}
If $M$ is an injective operator, then $\langle .\;|\;.\rangle_M$ is an inner product on $E$ and so $ W_M(T)$ is convex. If $M$ is not injective, what do you think about the convexity of $ W_M(T)$???

<p>At this point, the author computes the vector coefficients of each one of the free variables in $x$. These he calls the <em>fundamental solutions</em> $f_1,...,f_4$. Then $x$ can be written as $x=x_1 f_1 + x_3f_2+x_4f_3 + x_5f_4$ </p>

<p>Let $f:A\subseteq\mathbb{R}\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be integrable.</p>

<p>The set of all antiderivatives of $f$ is precisely the set of all functions $F:A\subseteq\mathbb{R}\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$ whose derivative is $f$. Now, if $F$ and $G$ are 2 antiderivatives of $f$, their difference $F-G$ is a constant function.</p>

<p>I suspect these constant functions are exact differential forms (since one can get a constant function by differentiating a polynomial of degree $1$). This would mean that $F$ and $G$ differ by an exact form, and so they're in the same cohomology class, but only if they're closed forms, which they can't be since their derivative is $f$ which is in general not zero.</p>

<p>Still, the idea that $F$ and $G$ differ by a (presumably) exact differential form, and the involvement of the differential operator, gives the whole thing a cohomological flavor.</p>

  <p>Then it follows from the properties of the determinant of a matrix
   that $\Omega$ is linear with respect to each argument. Moreover,
   $\Omega$ is skew symmetric with respect to the vectors $x^{*i}$ and
   with respect to the vectors $x_i$ (i= 1...n). Hence the uniqueness
   theorem (sec. 4.3) implies that $\Omega$ can be written as

In that case the argment was that since $f$ has no roots in $\mathbb{F}_5$ it is enough to check if $gcd(x^4+2,x^{24}-1)=1$. This gcd was calculated as follows:$$gcd(x^4+2,x^{24}-1)=gcd(x^4+2,(-2)^6-1)=1$$ I understood that computation and then I kept my life happilly.</p>

<p>However, when I was solving another problem, I needed to verify the reducibility or irreducibility of the polynomial $f(x)=x^4+1$ over $\mathbb{F}_5$. I know that this polynomial is reducible since $x^4+1=x^4-4=(x^2+3)(x^2+2)$ but I would like to see that in that case the $gcd(x^4+1,x^{24}-1)$ would be different of $1$ and that is where I think I did not understand the previous computation. I know that the answer has to be $x^2+3$ or $x^2+2$ but I do not know how to get it. Should I have to divide $x^{24}-1$ by $x^4+1$ and following with this strategy to find the gcd or is there any easier way to find it?</p>

<p>So using $C$, $\Delta$ and $A$ to denote constants that are in our way, we rewrite more neatly:</p>

<p>$$C \int_0^t \frac{1}{\sqrt s} e^{\frac{-\Delta}{s}} e^{-A s}\, ds $$</p>

<p>Now consider a series of change of variables:</p>

$$ C(\Delta)^{1/2}\int_0^t \frac{1}{\sqrt y} e^{\frac{-1}{y}} e^{-A\Delta y}\, dy $$</p>

<p>2) $y = x^2$ $dy = 2x dx$ yields</p>

<p>I don't get how to write an element of this set as a formal sum. On the internet I could find such a representation:
$$f = \sum_{a \in A}{n_a\phi_a}$$
Where $\phi_a(x) = \begin{cases}

                   \end{cases}$ </p>

<p>The problem is, I don't udnerstand what $n_a$ is here, many resources don't mention what this is. For example, on Wikipedia it's writtten as a function, but this doesn't feel natural to me. Is $n_a\phi_a$  a function composition then? An integer value seems to fit here more. </p>

<p>I am totally fine with less general definition of a free group $\mathbb{Z}^{\oplus n} = \underbrace{\mathbb{Z}\oplus\ .\ .\ .\ \oplus\mathbb{Z}}_\text{n-times}$. With an element of $\mathbb{Z}^{\oplus n}$ being a tuple $(m_1, ..., m_n)$ that can be written in a unique way as a sum:
$$\sum_{i = 1}^n{m_i\phi(i)}$$
With $\phi(i) := \underset{\text{i-th place}}{(0,\ .\ .\ .,\ 0,\ 1,\ 0,\ .\ .\ .\ ,\ 0)} \in \mathbb{Z}^{\oplus n}$ and $m_i$ being some integer coefficient.</p>

<p>I understand that $\mathbb{Z}^{(A)}\cong \mathbb{Z}^{\oplus n}$ if, for example, 
if  $A =\{1,\ .\ .\ .\ , n\}$, then $(m_1, ..., m_n)$ may be identified with a function $A\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ taking $i$ to $m_i$. But I don't understand how to put this information together and define an element of $\mathbb{Z}^{(A)}$ via sum.</p>

<p>Moreover, should group homomorphism $\psi:\mathbb{Z}^{(A)} \rightarrow G$  ($G$ is an arbitrary abelian group) be defined as 
    $$\psi(\sum_{a \in A}{n_a\phi_a}):= \sum_{a \in A}{n_af(a)}$$
where $f:A\rightarrow G$ is a set function (a forgetful functor, in fact). Again, only integer value $n_a$ feels ok for me.</p>

<p>Another point of confusion is the fact that only finite sums are used, $\mathbb{Z}^{(A)}$ is defined to have function with only finitely many non-zero values. Why is that? I don't have an intuitive understanding in what way infinities could 'break' free groups as I was only given a definition but no explanation why. </p>

"2382820","2382891","$\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$ isomorphic as groups?","<p>Using the axiom of choice, $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$ are equal-dimensional vector spaces over $\mathbb{Q}$ and so are isomorphic as $\mathbb{Q}$-vector spaces thus as groups.</p>

<p>This is obvious, however I recently began reading Godement's <em>Introduction à la théorie des groupes de Lie</em> and in particular I was reading the chapter on topological groups when I came across this statement: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given a group $G$, there is at most one topology that makes it into a topological group that is at the same time locally compact and countable to infinity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I don't know how to translate ""dénombrable à l'infini"" better, it means $G$ is a union of countably many compact sets)</p>

<p>Here's my reasoning: let $\phi: \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^2$ be a group isomorphism. In particular, it is a bijection, and so one can define a topology $\mathcal{T}$ such that $\phi$ is a homeomorphism from $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{T})$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the usual topology. </p>

<p>Obviously, $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{T})$ is locally compact and countable to infinity.</p>

<p>Moreover, $+: \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$, and letting $add$ denote the addition in $\mathbb{R}^2$, because $\phi$ is an isomorphism, we get $+= \phi^{-1}\circ add \circ (\phi\times\phi)$. Therefore, since all these maps are continuous (wrt the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathcal{T}$ on $\mathbb{R}$), so is $+$, and similarly one gets that $x\mapsto -x$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ wrt $\mathcal{T}$. </p>

<p>But then $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{T})$ is a locally compact topological group that's countable to infinity: according to Godement's claim $\mathcal{T}$ is the usual topology ! </p>

<p>This leads to the absurdity that $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$ are homeomorphic, which is trivially false. </p>

<p>I'm really stuck on this and I don't know where I went wrong. Could anybody please solve my problem? </p>

<p>EDIT : as suggested in the comments, here's a link to a dropbox file with the proof in Godement's book : <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2gxg1jpbdmmcg23/AACP__txcn3o26cw-JR5W5Oea?dl=0"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2gxg1jpbdmmcg23/AACP__txcn3o26cw-JR5W5Oea?dl=0</a>

<p>Since $(\cos x + 1)^2 = \frac{\cos2x}{2} + 2\cos x + \frac32$, it is evident that $\int(\cos x + 1)^2 dx = \int(\frac{\cos2x}{2} + 2\cos x + \frac32)dx$, which is solved quite easily. </p>

"2382895","2388279","On the polynomial formula for determinants","<p>I have three questions:</p>

<p>1) For the determinant of a matrix $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, there is the following polynomial formula:
$$
\det(Q)= \sum_\sigma \text{sgn}(\sigma) \prod_{i=1}^{n} Q_{\sigma(i),i}
\tag{*} $$
I know about the characteristic polynomial of a matrix whose roots are the eigenvalues, but I am not sure about how (*) comes about? In particular, what is $\sigma$ here and is $Q_{\sigma(i),i}$ the element at the $\sigma(i)$-th row and $i$-th column of $Q$? Would $\text{sgn}(\sigma) $ ever be negative?</p>

<p>2) As a follow up, let $\|Q\|_\infty$ be the largest absolute value of the elements of the $Q$ matrix, and let $\|Q\|$ be the operator norm, then, applying (*) to the below, we have
$$
\begin{split}
&amp;
|\det(I+Q)-1|
\\&amp;=
\left|
\prod_{i=1}^{n} (1+Q_{i,i})-1
+
\sum_{\sigma\neq\text{id}} \text{sgn}(\sigma) \prod_{i=1}^{n} (\delta_{\sigma(i),i}+Q_{\sigma(i),i})
\right|
\\ 
\end{split}
\tag{**}
$$</p>

<p>Can someone please explain how each of the two terms come about in (**)? I believe that the first term captures the diagonal components of $Q$ and the second term are the off-diagonals? Not sure what the $\delta_{\sigma(i), i}$ means though.</p>

<p>3) Finally, I would like to find <strong>a better</strong> upper bound for $(**)$ than the one given by @JoonasIlmavirta as</p>

<p>\begin{split}
&amp;
|\det(I+Q)-1|
\\&amp;=
\left|
\prod_{i=1}^{n} (1+Q_{i,i})-1
+
\sum_{\sigma\neq\text{id}} \text{sgn}(\sigma) \prod_{i=1}^{n} (\delta_{\sigma(i),i}+Q_{\sigma(i),i})
\right|
\\&amp;\leq
\left|
\prod_{i=1}^{n} (1+Q_{i,i})-1
\right|
+
\sum_{\sigma\neq\text{id}}
\left|
\prod_{i=1}^{n} (\delta_{\sigma(i),i}+Q_{\sigma(i),i})
\right|
\\&amp;\leq
(2^n-1)\times\|Q\|_\infty
+
(n!-1)\times 2^{n-1}\|Q\|_\infty
\\&amp;\leq
2^nn!\|Q\|_\infty.
\end{split}</p>

<p>Each term in the product $\left|
\prod_{i=1}^{n} (\delta_{\sigma(i),i}+Q_{\sigma(i),i})
\right|$ above is at most $2$ in absolute value, and there is at least one $i$ so that $\delta_{\sigma(i),i}=0$, so the product is at most $2^{n-1}\|Q\|_\infty$ in absolute value.
The rest of the estimates are similar.</p>

I'm interested in the inverse $\mathbb{R}_{[0,1)}\mapsto2^\mathbb{N}$, i.e., given $r\in\mathbb{R}$, what's the corresponding $x_r\in2^\mathbb{N}$ that generates it?

<p><strong>__Edit__</strong></p>

<p>Firstly, thanks very much Lubin, Manmaid, Ross, Daniel for your elaborate and thoughtful answers/comments. I haven't had time to fully digest everything, but one apparent take-away is the pesky appearance of infinite subsets. And that's got to be an unnecessary artifact: there's no reason why, say, $\frac13=.333\ldots=\sum_{i\in x}\frac1{2^i}$, should require some stupid-large $x\subseteq\mathbb N$ for its representation, whereas the information content of $\frac13$ is ultimately pretty minimal.</p>

<p>And it was Ross' mention of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyadic_rational"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyadic_rational</a> that suggested the culprit. It's the explicit ""<em><strong>base&nbsp;2</strong></em>"" representation/expansion which I naively introduced in the above question that I'm now thinking is the problem. Daniel's answer introduces a slightly different expansion, but the same underlying problem remains.</p>

<p>So here's a tentative conjecture for a more general representation, which hopefully maps ""simple&nbsp;$r\in\mathbb R$'s"" to ""simple&nbsp;$x_r\in2^\mathbb N$'s"". But the representation algorithm's somewhat more complicated than Daniel's or mine above. And the meaning of the subset-order $x_1\subseteq x_2$ isn't at all obvious.</p>

<p>Consider the usual pair enumeration <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_function</a> whereby $\mathbb{N\times N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$. And we can then iterate that for $\mathbb{N^3\rightarrow N}$ (or any finite power, but we just need $3$). So consider some $x\in2^\mathbb N$ and interpret every $i\in x$ as three-component $i=(j,k,m)\mapsto j/k^m$. That is, we decompose $r\in\mathbb R$ into rational components of the form $j/k^m\in\mathbb Q$, with any mix of <strong><em>base&nbsp;k</em></strong>'s that's convenient.</p>

<p>Now, as Lubin and Ross previously pointed out, it's <strong>still</strong> possible to represent, e.g., $\frac12=\frac1{2^2}+\frac1{2^3}+\cdots$. So we need some formal way to distinguish a ""canonical representation"" $\frac12=\frac1{2^1}$. So I haven't figured that out, nor how to interpret the poset order $x_1\subseteq x_2$, etc.</p>

<p>But I believe the premise, that these pesky infinite subsets should go away (except for transcendental reals) is necessary for any sensible $\mathbb R_{[0,1)}\Leftrightarrow2^\mathbb N$. As per <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_domain#Explanation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_domain#Explanation</a>, the poset order is an information order, so you shouldn't have teensy-weensy elements on one side of the $\Leftrightarrow$ corresponding to biggy-wiggy elements on the other side. Somehow, that's got to go. But is the preceding conjecture really the simplest or most straightforward way?</p>

<p><strong>__Edit#2__</strong>
Reply (too lengthy for comment) to Ross's comment below, ""With your edit I understand even less what you are asking...""</p>

<p>Yeah, sorry about that. In a preceding comment replying to you, I mentioned</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Actually, the constructible bijection's for an explicit correspondence between the universal domains $\mathcal P\omega\Leftrightarrow\mathcal U$ ( where the rhs denotes the universal interval domain, as per <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=epb39s2wgt0C&amp;pg=PA162"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://books.google.com/books?id=epb39s2wgt0C&amp;pg=PA162</a> )</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I'd thought I'd solved that to my own satisfaction, modulo the kind of bijection I asked for here. That bijection's ultimate purpose is thus a correspondence between sets of integers on the $\mathcal P\omega\equiv2^\mathcal N$ side and half-open real intervals with rational endpoints on the $\mathcal U$ side.</p>

<p>By the way, note that in that $\mathcal U$ domain, any real is the lub of intervals including it. Put another way, the real line corresponds to the collection of total (aka maximal) elements of $\mathcal U$ wrt reverse-inclusion ordering. That is, the smaller the interval, the more information you have about the real it refers to.</p>

<p>The upshot is that for the purposes of this question, I was perfectly happy discussing rational approximations to reals. As per a comment to Manmaid,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...Actually, I simplified the question by neglecting to discuss intervals. If you represent $r_{x_n}\in\mathbb R$ by an $x_n=\lbrace i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_n\rbrace$ containing the first $n$ smallest $i$'s in order, with $i_n$ the largest among them, then you're really representing an interval $[r_{x_n},r_{x_n}+1/2^{i_n})$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So every time I mentioned ""real"", my underlying thinking was really ""interval"" as an element of that $\mathcal U$ domain. But I didn't think it necessary to mention that in the context of the original question. I thought I just needed the requested bijection wrt reals, and then everything would just fall into place wrt $\mathcal U$.</p>

<p>So where'd that go wrong? The bijection's subject to a pesky additional constraint wrt that reverse-inclusion information ordering, which it must respect. Suppose the bijection's $b:\mathcal U\rightarrow2^{\mathcal N}$,
and write $u_1\sqsubseteq u_2$ for the $u_1,u_2\in\mathcal U$ poset order, and $x_1\subseteq x_2$ for the $x_1,x_2\in2^\mathcal N$ order. Then $b$ must satisfy $u_1\sqsubseteq u_2\Longrightarrow b(u_1)\subseteq b(u_2)$. (and given that $b$'s one-to-one, the arrow has to go both ways)</p>

<p>And that didn't just automatically happen like I'd expected (more accurately, I didn't even think about it until I noticed it wasn't happening). And that unexpected problem got me asking additional stuff seemingly unrelated to the original question, which I guess accounts for your ""understand even less what you are asking"" remark. (and I hope this helps clear that up a little)</p>

<p>Based on the assumption that gases mix uniformly upon entering the container, I came up with this:</p>

<p>At every time interval $dt$, if the current proportion of helium is $p$, then the total volume of helium is $pV$.  After $dt$ seconds, $rdt$ litres of helium enter, and $prdt$ litres exit.  So the new volume would be:</p>

<p>$pV + rdt - prdt$</p>

It must also be a multiple of 3 because each element given is of order 3. So this leaves possible subgroup sizes of 30, 60, and 120.</p>

<p>Is there anything else I can do here to solve this? And is this process work for all similar problems to this?</p>

<p>Now if $x\in \mathbb{R}_{[0,1)}$ is of the form $\frac{n}{2^m}$, where $n&lt;2^m$ is odd natural number and $m\in \mathbb{N}$, then values looks like this:

You immediately fix $f(\frac{1}{8})=(0,1,0,0,0,\dots)$, $f(\frac{3}{8})=(0,0,1,1,1,\dots)$, $f(\frac{5}{8})=(1,1,0,0,0,\dots)$ and $f(\frac{7}{8})=(1,0,1,1,1,\dots)$.Continue in this way and finally you have $f$ is a bijective mapping.</p>

<p>$$A=f^{-1}(E)=f^{-1}((B_1\cup B_2)^c)=(f^{-1}(B_1\cup B_2))^c=(f^{-1}(B_1)\cup f^{-1}(B_2))^c.$$</p>

<p>Therefore $A$ can be written as a sequence of set operations on $f^{-1}(B_1)$ and $f^{-1}(B_2).$  Hence $A\in \sigma(f^{-1}(\mathbb B)).$  </p>

<p>Conceivably, this argument applies to any $E$ that can be produced by a countable sequence of set operations on sets in $\mathbb B$.  However, I find it difficult to formalize this argument with mathematical expressions/equations.  Is the above argument correct?  Is there a way to formalize it, or is there a better (more rigorous) proof?

  <p>This is a proof verification post. I'm attaching the problem and my solution to it. I believe that my solution is too long. Please check it it is correct  and also let me know if there are methods by which I can shorten the proof a bit. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Problem :</strong> Let $\left(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mu\right)$ be a measure space and $f,g:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ be Borel functions, i.e. $f^{-1}\left(\mathcal{B}\right) \subset \mathcal{F},~g^{-1}\left(\mathcal{B}\right) \subset \mathcal{F},$ where $\mathcal{B}$ denotes the Borel-$\sigma$-field of $\mathbb{R}$.</p>

<p>Show that, if $\int_{\Omega} f d\mu$ exists and $c \in \mathbb{R},$ then $\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right) d\mu$ exists and
$$\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right) d\mu=c\int_{\Omega} f d\mu$$</p>

<p><strong>My Solution :</strong> To show existence, it is enough to show that $cf$ is Borel. We have to show that $\left(cf\right)^{-1}\left(\mathcal{B}\right) \subset \mathcal{F}$. Let us choose (arbitrarily) $B \in \mathcal{B}$. We want to show that $\left(cf\right)^{-1}\left(B\right) \in \mathcal{F}$.</p>

<p>Note that, $\left(cf\right)^{-1}\left(B\right)=\left\{\omega \in \Omega : \left(cf\right)\left(\omega\right) \in B\right\}=\left\{\omega \in \Omega : cf\left(\omega\right) \in B\right\}$</p>

<p>Suppose $c=0$. Either we have $0 \in B,$ or $0 \notin B$. Thus, $\left\{\omega \in \Omega : cf\left(\omega\right) \in B\right\}=\left\{\omega \in \Omega : 0 \in B\right\}=\phi \text{ or } \Omega,$ and hence, $\left(cf\right)^{-1}\left(B\right) \in \mathcal{F}$.</p>

<p>Now suppose $c \neq 0$. Define, $\frac{B}{c}:=\left\{\frac{b}{c} : b \in B\right\}$. Then,
\begin{align*}
\left(cf\right)^{-1}\left(B\right)&amp;=\left\{\omega \in \Omega : cf\left(\omega\right) \in B\right\}\\
&amp;=\left\{\omega \in \Omega :\exists b \in B, \text{ such that } cf\left(\omega\right)=b\right\}\\
&amp;=\left\{\omega \in \Omega :\exists b \in B, \text{ such that } f\left(\omega\right)=\frac{b}{c}\right\}\\
&amp;=\left\{\omega \in \Omega : f\left(\omega\right) \in \frac{B}{c}\right\}\\
&amp;=f^{-1}\left(\frac{B}{c}\right)
\end{align*}
If we can show that $\frac{B}{c} \in \mathcal{B}$, we are done.</p>

<p>Now, $B \in \mathcal{B} \implies \exists \text{ a sequence } \left(A_n\right)_{n=1}^{\infty} \text{ of open intervals in } \mathbb{R} \text{ such that } B=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n$</p>

<p>Claim : $\frac{B}{c}=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{A_n}{c}$. Now,</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
a \in \frac{B}{c} &amp;\implies \exists b \in B, \text{ such that } a=\frac{b}{c}\\
&amp;\implies \exists n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \left\{0\right\}, \text{ and } b \in A_n, \text{ such that } a=\frac{b}{c}\\
&amp;\implies \exists n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \left\{0\right\}, \text{ such that } a=\frac{A_n}{c}\\
&amp;\implies a \in \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{A_n}{c}
\end{align*}</p>

<p>Thus, $$\frac{B}{c} \subset \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{A_n}{c}$$
To show the other side,</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
a \in \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{A_n}{c} &amp;\implies \exists n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \left\{0\right\}, \text{ such that } a=\frac{A_n}{c}\\
&amp;\implies \exists n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \left\{0\right\}, \text{ and } b \in A_n, \text{ such that } a=\frac{b}{c}\\
&amp;\implies \exists b \in B, \text{ such that } a=\frac{b}{c}\\
&amp;\implies a \in \frac{B}{c}
\end{align*}
Thus, $$\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{A_n}{c} \subset \frac{B}{c}$$
Hence we have, $$\frac{B}{c}=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{A_n}{c}$$</p>

<p>The crucial (although trivial) thing is that for all $n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \left\{0\right\}, A_n \text{ is an open interval in } \mathbb{R} \implies \frac{A_n}{c} \text{ is an open interval in } \mathbb{R}$. And hence, $\frac{B}{c} \in \mathcal{B}$. This completes the existence part.</p>

<p>Now to show that,
$$\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right) d\mu=c\int_{\Omega} f d\mu \tag{1}$$</p>

<p>If $c=0,$ $(1)$ holds trivially.</p>

<p>$$\text{By definition, }L.H.S.=\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right) d\mu=\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right)^+ d\mu-\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right)^- d\mu$$
$$\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right)^+ d\mu=\sup\left\{\int_{\Omega}\psi d\mu : \psi \text{ is a simple function}, 0 \leq \psi \leq \left(cf\right)^+\right\}$$
Suppose, $c&gt;0$. Then, $\left(cf\right)^+ = \max\left\{cf,0\right\} = c \max\left\{f,0\right\} = cf^+$</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right)^+ d\mu&amp;=\sup\left\{\int_{\Omega}\psi d\mu : \psi \text{ is a simple function}, 0 \leq \psi \leq cf^+\right\}\\
&amp;=\sup\left\{\int_{\Omega}\psi d\mu : \psi \text{ is a simple function}, 0 \leq \frac{\psi}{c} \leq f^+\right\}\\
&amp;=\sup\left\{\int_{\Omega}c\cdot\frac{\psi}{c} d\mu : \frac{\psi}{c} \text{ is a simple function}, 0 \leq \frac{\psi}{c} \leq f^+\right\}\\
&amp;\left[\psi \text{ is a simple function } \implies \frac{\psi}{c} \text{ is a simple function } \right]\\
&amp;=\sup\left\{\int_{\Omega}c\psi^* d\mu : \psi^* \text{ is a simple function}, 0 \leq \psi^* \leq f^+\right\}\\
&amp;=\sup\left\{c\int_{\Omega}\psi^* d\mu : \psi^* \text{ is a simple function}, 0 \leq \psi^* \leq f^+\right\}\\
&amp;=c\sup\left\{\int_{\Omega}\psi^* d\mu : \psi^* \text{ is a simple function}, 0 \leq \psi^* \leq f^+\right\}\\
&amp;=c\int_{\Omega} f^+ d\mu
\end{align*}</p>

<p>In the same way, $\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right)^- d\mu = c\int_{\Omega} f^- d\mu,$ and hence,</p>

<p>$$\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right) d\mu=\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right)^+ d\mu-\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right)^- d\mu=c\int_{\Omega} f^+ d\mu-c\int_{\Omega} f^- d\mu=c\int_{\Omega} f d\mu$$</p>

<p>Similarly, if $c&lt;0,$ we have $\left(cf\right)^+ = \max\left\{cf,0\right\} = c\min\left\{f,0\right\} = -c\max\left\{-f,0\right\} = -cf^-,$ and hence, $\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right)^+ d\mu = -c\int_{\Omega} f^- d\mu$.</p>

<p>Also in this case, $\left(cf\right)^- = \max\left\{-cf,0\right\} = -c\max\left\{f,0\right\} = -cf^+,$ and hence,
$\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right)^- d\mu = -c\int_{\Omega} f^+ d\mu$.</p>

<p>Thus we have
$$\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right) d\mu=\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right)^+ d\mu-\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right)^- d\mu=-c\int_{\Omega} f^- d\mu+c\int_{\Omega} f^+ d\mu=c\int_{\Omega} f d\mu$$</p>

<p>Hence, in all the cases, $(1)$ holds. Hence the proof.</p>

I am trying to show it directly, rather than using that the closed graph theorem leads to the open mapping theorem, and then showing the inverse is bounded based on that.</p>

<p>Let $A:X\to Y$ be a bounded, linear, bijective operator between the Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$. Suppose $A$ is closed.</p>

<p>Let $y\in Y$ and let $(y_n)$ be a sequence in $Y$ such that $y_n \to y$. As $A$ is bijective we have that there exists $x$ and a sequence $(x_n)$ in $X$ such that $x_n \to x$, $Ax_n = y_n \to y = Ax$.</p>

<p>Then
\begin{align}
||A^{-1}|| &amp; = \sup_{||y||_Y = 1} ||A^{-1}y||_X \\
 &amp; = \sup_{||Ax||_y = 1} ||A^{-1}Ax||_X \\

<p>I don't see how to get a bound on $||A^{-1}||$, or where the fact that $A$ is closed gets used? It seems that $A$ being bijective provides the closed property, which is that for a sequence $(x_n)$ in $X$ such that $x_n \to x\in X$ and $Ax_n \to y \in Y$, then $y = \lim_{n\to \infty} Ax_n = Ax$. If its bijective surely this holds automatically..</p>

Provide efficient (in terms of expected running time and expected number of random bits used) schemes for generating samples from the distribution over the set {2,3,4, ...,12} induced by rolling two unbiased dice and taking the sum of their outcomes.</p>

<p>In simple words, we need to make fair coin which produces an equivalent two fair dice that takes the sum of their outcomes. Also, we need to design an algorithm that does this job.</p>

<p>The problem that I have is I have 36 different possible of rolling two unbiased dice. But if you roll a coin you can have 32 or 64 possible values but you cannot have 36. So, there must be a way to make a re-step if we have a particular case. Another problem is that the first case where sum of dice equal 2 happens only once out of 36. Thus, suppose we have 6 digits, then 36x=64, x=1.76. Now how to simulate this 1.76 into discrete and do I need to round it up or down but if we round it up or down, then we do not have an exact simulation between 36 and 64.</p>

<p>Any hints/suggestions on how can I prove this rigorously (if it even holds)?</p>

<p>EDIT: some details for where this comes from:</p>

\right]}(t),$$
where the $X_{i,m}$ are i.i.d. standard normal random variables.
We need to show that it satisfies the properties to be time white noise, that is to say:
$$\mathbb{E}[\xi(f)\xi(g)]=\langle f,g\rangle.$$
The left hand side equals (using the independence of the random variables considered)
\begin{align*}&amp;\mathbb{E}\left[\int_0^1\xi(t)f(t)\mathrm{d}t\int_0^1\xi(t)g(t)\mathrm{d}t\right]\\

This is quite satisfactory because the book can (and does) talk about 'functions' whose domains are classes, and 'partially ordered classes' and so on.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>without</strong> defining what 'a triple of objects' and 'a pair of objects' is.</p>

<p>P.S. This reminds of the situation I had faced when learning category theory for the first time.

$$y = ln x$$ $$y' = \frac{1}{x}$$

$$y' = 1$$</p>

$$y = ln (1-x)$$ $$y' = \frac{-1}{1-x}$$

<p>I can show by presenting the basis of $L_1L_2/K$. If $K\subset L_1\cap L_2$ is proper, this means $L_1\cap L_2$ has non-trivial overlap(i.e. I can start removing redundant basis elements from either $L_1$ or $L_2$). This will show $[L_1L_2:K]&lt;[L_1:K][L_2:K]$. </p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This proof lacks elegance though simple. Is there a proof based on purely showing algebraic manipulation to complete the proof(i.e. showing either $[L_1\cap L_2:K]\leq 1$, $[L_1L_2: L_1\cap L_2]=[L_1:K][L_2:K]$ or other equivalent relations)?</p></li>
<li><p>Why should I expect this is the case without looking at the basis?(i.e. Assume I do not know the proof but I want to know the reason why this algebraic relation leads to this special vector space construction.) </p></li>
<li><p>If $[L_1:K],[L_2:K]$ are relatively prime, this becomes trivial. In my view point $L_1L_2=L_1\otimes_K L_2$, relatively primeness implies for simple extensions $L_1,L_2$ over $K$, the $K-$algebra can be generated by the simple tensor of the two generators. How do I generalize this statement for arbitrary case by assuming finite extension say $L_1=K(a_1,\dots, a_m),L_2=K(b_1,\dots b_n)$ where I assume $m,n$ are minimal generator and $[L_1:K]=m_1,[L_2:K]=m_2$ which may not have any straightforward relationship with $m$ and $n$ respectively?(i.e. I want a straightforward proof showing that for $[L_1:K],[L_2:K]$ relatively prime, I can present an explicit construction of basis of $L_1\otimes_K L_2$
This statement does not say $[L_1:K],[L_2:K]$ must be relatively prime here.</p></li>

<p>Now, I wrote out the truth table, that was relatively straightforward. It's showing the iff criterion for $A \Delta (B \Delta C)$ in the fashion intended by the problem setter that's tripping me. Sure, the iff criterion follows from reading off the truth table, but that's casework and I can't help but feel there's a more ""correct""/elegant way of seeing it. Let me spell out my thoughts.</p>

<p>We have$$B \Delta C = (B - C) \cup (C - B).$$Then$$A \Delta (B \Delta C) = (A - ((B - C) \cup (C - B))) \cup (((B - C) \cup (C - B)) - A).$$What can we say about $A - ((B - C) \cup (C - B))$? Well, I showed in a previous problem that$$X - (Y \cup Z) = (X - Y) \cap (X - Z).$$So I can write$$A - ((B - C) \cup (C - B)) = (A - (B - C)) \cap (A - (C - B)).$$Also, it is not too hard to see that$$(X \cup Y) - Z = (X -Z) \cup (Y - Z),$$so$$((B - C) \cup (C - B)) - A = ((B - C) - A) \cup ((C - B) - A).$$So we have$$\begin{align*}
A \Delta (B \Delta C) &amp; = (A - ((B - C) \cup (C - B))) \cup (((B - C) \cup (C - B)) - A) \\ &amp; = ((A - (B - C)) \cap (A - (C - B))) \cup (((B - C) - A) \cup ((C - B) - A)).\end{align*}$$However, I'm stuck at this point... presuming that expanding out is the intended first step and I'm not totally going up the wrong alley... and don't know how to see the iff criterion. Could someone give me a hint? I would prefer a conceptual, elegant way to see the iff criterion as opposed to deferring to the casework of the truth table.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Anurag A wrote the following.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps a proof by contradiction would be easier to write. Suppose $x \in A \Delta (B \Delta C)$ and it belongs to an <strong>even number</strong> of the sets among $A,B$ and $C$.

The $0$ case is easy because then $x \not\in  A \Delta (B \Delta C)$. </p>
  
  <p>Case (1): $x \in A \, \wedge \, x \in B \, \wedge \, x \not\in C$ (same idea will work if we switch $B$ and $C$). Then $x \in A$ and $x \in B \Delta C$. But then $x \in A \cap (B \Delta C)$., which means $x \not \in  A \Delta (B \Delta C)$, a contradiction.</p>

<p><strong>Questions :</strong></p>

<p>Now, I have some questions based on the above description:</p>

<ol>
<li>I'm not a mathematician (I'm a software developer), so can someone confirm to me if all 5 formulas are correct?</li>
<li>Which of the 5 metrics is the best (or commonly used) to compare two histograms? (As I have read people uses commonly the Chi-Square and the Intersection, but I'm not sure).</li>
<li>Is there some other good metric (or commonly used) to compare two histograms?</li>
<li>As I understand: when using the <strong>Chi-Square</strong>, <strong>Euclidean Distance</strong> or <strong>Normalized Euclidean Distance</strong>, the closer to zero is the result, higher is the similarity between the histograms. In the other hand, when using the <strong>Intersection</strong> or the <strong>Normalized Intersection</strong>, higher results means higher similarity between the histograms. If it is correct, is there a way that I can invert the results from the <strong>Intersection</strong> and <strong>Normalized Intersection</strong> so it 'works' as the other metrics (closer to zero means higher similarity)? As the <strong>Normalized Intersection</strong> results range is between 0-1 it is easy to invert, but I don't know if it is possible to the <strong>Intersection</strong> metric.</li>

"2383978","2383985","general rule for x raised to any exponent y","<p>This is a pretty basic question and I bet that when it is answered it will strike me as intuitive and obvious. Nevertheless, this is still a question that has bugged me for quite a while. Basic exponents (where the exponent is a whole number) work as such: $x^a = \underbrace{x \cdot x \cdot x \ldots x}_a$. Prealgebra tells us that $x^{1/a} = b \text{ where } b^a = x$ and that $x^{a/b} = (x^{1/b})^a$ and that $x^{-a} = \frac{1}{x^a}$. However, I fail to find much common ground between the way basic exponents work and the ways those of prealgebra work. I realize the logic behind negative exponents: $x^{a-1}=\frac{x^a}{x}$ yet I fail to see a corollary between the basic exponents and the fractional ones.  </p>

Since $K/k$ is degree 2, we can label every $c\in K$ as $c=c_1e_1+c_2e_2$ for $e_1,e_2$ basis of $K$ as $k$ vector space. Then $h=h_1e_1+h_2e_2,g=g_1e_1+g_2e_2$, $h_i,g_i\in k(X)$.

$$S_n= \frac{r^n}{1+r^n} $$
With $r&gt;0$</p>

<p>The theorem to apply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>if $\{S_n\}$ is non-decreasing , then $\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} S_n = sup\{S_n\}$. </p>
    
    <p>If $\{S_n\}$ is non-increasing, then $\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} S_n = inf\{S_n\}$</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Nonincreasing/decreasing?
Considering 
$$ S_{n+1} = \frac  {r^{n+1} }    {1+r^{n+1} }$$
$$ S_{n+1} = \frac  {r \cdot r^n }    {r \cdot (\frac{1}{r} +r^n})  $$
$$ S_{n+1} = \frac  { r^n }    {\frac{1}{r} +r^n }  $$</p>

<p>When $r \geq 1$
$$1 \geq \frac{1}{r}$$
$$1+ r^n     \geq  \frac{1}{r} + r^n$$
$$S_n = \frac{r^n}{1+ r^n} \leq      \frac{r^n}{     \frac{1}{r} + r^n      } = S_{n+1} $$
It shows that the sequence is non decreasing by definition</p>

<p>It follows that by the theorem stating that if $S_n$ is non-decreasing, we have
$$ \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} S_n = sup\{S_n\}$$</p>

<p>Considering  that 
$$ S_n= \frac{r^n}{1+r^n} &lt; \frac{r^n}{r^n} = 1 =&gt; sup\{S_n\}=1 =  \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} S_n$$</p>

<p>For every $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that $| S_n – 1| &lt; \epsilon$ with $n \geq N$</p>

<p>Considering
$$ | S_n – 1| = |\frac{r^n}{1+r^n} -1 |= |- \frac{1}{1+r^n} | = \frac{1}{1+r^n} &lt; \frac{1}{r^n}&lt;\epsilon$$
Let N be such that 
$$ \frac{1}{r^N} &lt; \epsilon$$
$$\frac{1}{\epsilon} &lt; r^N$$
$$\log \frac{1}{\epsilon} &lt; N \cdot \log r$$
$$N &gt; - \frac{\log \epsilon}{log r}$$
For every $\epsilon &gt;0$, there is $n\geq N &gt; - \frac{\log \epsilon}{\log r}$ s.t.
$$|S_n -1| &lt; \epsilon$$
It follows that when $r \geq 1$, $S_n$ converges.

Can someone explain for me the logic of these examples below? </p>

<p>For each example, on the top line I guess they're just splitting up the left side on the right side? I can see in <code>example 1</code> how <code>8x(x)</code> is the same as <code>8x</code>, then they just moved the 3 outside the bracket and applied the 8x I guess. But then why is <code>8x(x)</code> equivalent to <code>8x^2</code> ?  And why is there still an <code>x</code> after the 24? <code>8x(3) = 24</code> so shouldn't we just lose the <code>x</code> there as the calculation has been done?</p>

<pre><code>8x(x+3) = 8x(x) + 8x(3)

"2384276","2384288","How to tell an audience that in a chain of composable morphisms some of the domains and codomains may be equal?","<p><strong>Stylistic question.</strong> In category theory, if you have to write about sequences of the form $\dotsm\xrightarrow[]{f_2}o_2\xrightarrow[]{f_1}o_1\xrightarrow[]{f_0}o_0$, and you have to tell readers that there <em>may</em> be some equalities $o_i=o_{j}$ between objects, $i&lt;j$, but that this is inessential and all that matters is that <em>none of the $f_i$ is an identity arrow</em>, what would <strong>you</strong> write?</p>

<p>EDIT: inexperienced readers, <em>beware</em>: there seems to be something like a consensus that <strong>there is no problem here</strong>, not even an expository problem, and you will not find much mathematics in all of this, and you might like to <strong>skip</strong> it. Thanks to the commenters.</p>

<ul>
<li>EDIT: I propose the following solution: One could briefly write </li>
</ul>

<p>""Note that this is a <strong>pasting scheme</strong>, and that $o_i=o_j$ is not an equality between objects, but rather <strong>an equality between 0-cells of a pasting scheme</strong>, and, as such, does not violate the principle of equivalence."" </p>

<p>This, however, is not short, and it might confuse an audience who does not know about pasting schemes. </p>

<p>More briefly, one could say something informal about <em>syntax</em> and <em>semantics</em>, saying that $o_i=o_j$ is pure syntax.</p>

<p>It seems to me that only <em>categorical properties formulated by way of mentioning equalitites between objects</em> violate the principle of equivalence.</p>

<p>Do you agree with that?</p>

<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>In formulating the question, I have already given an example of what <em>I</em> would write.</li>
<li>The reason I am asking is that <em>mentioning equalities between objects</em> is held to be something to be avoided, with good reason. A related keyword is <em>principle of equivalence</em>.</li>
<li><p>Relatedly: it is well known that the very definition of categories (as it is presented nowadays) involves an equation between objects, namely when one stipulates that only for morphisms $f$ and $g$ with $\mathrm{dom}(f)=\mathrm{cod}(g)$ the composite $f\circ g$ is defined; however, this is not <em>really</em> an equation of objects, rather <em>an equality between things of sort ""codomain-sort of the cod- and dom- functions""</em>, in the sense of categorical logic. (I seem to mean it as I say it: both cod and dom are function-symbols, as such, they have types, which are lists of sorts, the last component of which is what I call ""codomain-sort of the cod-and dom-functions"".) So one way to defend the usual definition of categories against charges of violating the principle of equivalence is to say ""I did not equate objects, I just equated things of ""codomain-sort of the cod- and dom-functions"", and stipulating that equating such is permissible.</p></li>
<li><p>I emphasize that part of the expostion-problem stated in the question is that <em>I insist that readers have to be told</em>, briefly, in a low-fuss fashion, that some, and even many, equalities between objects in the chain of morphisms are permitted, so <em>some</em> way of saying it has to be found. <em>I see no better way than what I wrote in the question.</em> To me this seems a reason for violating the principle of equicalence. <em>Of course</em> I am aware that one way of getting around explictly mentioning an equality between objects would be to <em>disguise the objects</em>, dressing them up in the dom- and cod- functions. But there is <strong>one precise reason why to me this seems not a solution</strong>: one then <strong>has to make the arbitrary choice whether to refer to $o_i$ by way of the proxy $\mathrm{cod}(f_i)$, or the proxy $\mathrm{dom}(f_{i-1})$</strong>. (Incidentally, I would appreciate a better technical term than ""proxy"" here, which is belong to another science, and using ""representative"" instead here seems not good, since this, in turn, usually means something else.) One might be tempted to let oneself be guided by the indexation in making this choice, but this is contingent notational criterion. I see no natural way to avoid explicitly speaking of equality of objects when telling the audience that some of the $o_i$ may be equal.  </p></li>

<p>I don't think this is something I can prove on my own. However, I can't seem to find the proof of it online either. </p>

<p>It makes sense intuitively. If for every vertex $v$, in graph $G$, there exists a perfect matching that doesn't include $v$, then removing $v$ and its incident edges would result in a perfect matching because one existed that didn't include $v$ in the first place.</p>

<h2>Terminology:</h2>

<p>Following the terminology of <em>Théorie des ensembles — Jean-Louis Krivine</em>:</p>

<p>Consider a collection $X$ and a logical statement $E(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ with $n$ variables whose parameters are objects of X. The statement $E$ restricted to $X$ is denoted as $E^X(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ and is defined recursively as:</p>

<ol>
<li>$E$ is one of the forms: $x \in y, x = y, x \in a, x = a, a \in x, a \in b, a = b$, where $a$ and $b$ are objects of $X$; the restricted statement $E^X$ is $E$ itself.</li>
<li>$E$ is $\text{not}\; F$; then $E^X$ is $\text{not}\; F^X$</li>
<li>$E$ is $F \; \text{or} \; G$; then $E^X$ is $F^X \,\text{or} \; G^X$.</li>
<li>$E$ is $\exists x F(x, x_1, \dots, x_n)$; then $E^X$ is $\exists x[X(x) \land F^X(x, x_1, \dots, x_n)]$.</li>
</ol>

<p>We say that a collection $X$ agrees with $E$ if
$$\forall x_1 \dots \forall x_k[X(x_1) \land \dots \land X(x_k) \implies (E(x_1, \dots, x_k) \Leftrightarrow E^X(x_1, \dots, x_k))].$$</p>

<p>We can see that if the statement $E$ is without quantifiers; $E^X = E$; therefore, any collection agrees with $E$.</p>

<p>If $E$ doesn't have a free variable then ""$V_\beta$ agrees with $E$"" means that ""$E$ is true in the universe iff it is true in $V_\beta$.""</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>From my understanding for all statements $E(x_1, \dots, x_n)$, whose parameters are in an arbitrary collection $X$, it should <em>trivially</em> follow that $X$ agrees with $E(x_1, \dots, x_n)$. Is there any statement $E(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ whose parameters are in $X$, for some collection $X$, such that $X$ doesn't agree with $E$?</p>

<p>Also, when dealing with statements without free variables. Is</p>

<p>$$E = \forall x\exists y[P(x) \in y]$$ a statement that doesn't agree with, say, $V_3$, where $V_\alpha$ is the von Neumann stage of order $\alpha$, but agrees with, say, $V_\omega$?</p>

  <p>Prove that $f(x,y)=xy$ is differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$ using the $\epsilon$ definition.</p>

<p>We can use the definition of differentiability: 
$$
f(x_0+\Delta x, y_0+\Delta y)-f(x_0,y_0)=f_x(x_0,y_0)\cdot\Delta x + f_y(x_0,y_0)\cdot \Delta y+\epsilon_1\cdot\Delta x+\epsilon_2\cdot\Delta y

According to the above formula we get:
$$
x(y-y_0)-x_0(y-y_0)=(x-x_0)(y-y_0)=\epsilon_1\cdot(x-x_0)+\epsilon_2\cdot(y-y_0)
$$
By comparing the coefficients we have that $\epsilon_2=x-x_0$ thus:
$$
\lim_{(x,y)\to(x_0,y_0)} (x-x_0)=0
$$
But what about $\epsilon_1$?
We can conclude that $\epsilon_1(x-x_0)=0$ but we can't know if $\epsilon_1$ necessarily goes to $0$.</p>

$$\sqrt{x} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{4^k}\binom{2k}{k}\left(1-\frac{1}{x} \right)^k$$ valid for $x&gt;1$, with x being a rational number.</p>

<p>This series is zero at $x={1}$, but appears to converge to $\sqrt{x}$ for values of $x$ between $\frac{1}{2}$ and $1$.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Note w.r.t. @MarkViola's Answer:</strong>
With hindsight I do not need to investigate properties of above formula $x&lt;1$ as the formula for $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$ with $(x&gt;1)$ can be found using a very similar method to MarkViola's Answer with</p>

<p>$$\left(1-t\right)^{1/2}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k\binom{1/2}{k}t^k$$</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>$$\binom{1/2}{k}=\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{4^k \left( 2k-1\right)}\binom{2k}{k} $$</p>

<p>Resulting in</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} = -\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{4^k \left( 2k-1\right)}\binom{2k}{k}\left(1-\frac{1}{x} \right)^k$$</p>

<p><strong>End of Addition</strong></p>

<p>The series approximation does not converge for complex numbers with real component zero, but does appear to correctly converge to $\sqrt{x}$ when calculating the square root of numbers like $(1+i)$</p>

<p>How do I prove the formula and in doing so best find, specify and justify the complete domain of numbers {rational, real, complex} over which such a series approximation formula to $\sqrt{x}$ will converge to the required value? </p>

<p><strong>Some thoughts with Reference to @SimplyBeautifulArt's comment/question.</strong></p>

<p>Introducing Catalan Number's $C_k=\frac{1}{k+1}\binom{2k}{k}$ allows the formula to be split into two parts, thus</p>

<p>$$\sqrt{x} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{k}{4^k}C_k\left(1-\frac{1}{x} \right)^k + \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{4^k}C_k\left(1-\frac{1}{x} \right)^k$$</p>

<p>For example for $\sqrt{5}$
$$\sqrt{5} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{k}{4^k}C_k\left(1-\frac{1}{5} \right)^k + \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{4^k}C_k\left(1-\frac{1}{5} \right)^k$$</p>

<p>with the ratio of the two terms seemingly giving the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Golden Ratio</a> $\phi$. </p>

<p>In the case of $\sqrt{2}$ the ratio of the two terms below appears to be double the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_ratio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Silver Ratio</a>.</p>

<p>$$\sqrt{2} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{k}{4^k}C_k\left(1-\frac{1}{2} \right)^k + \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{4^k}C_k\left(1-\frac{1}{2} \right)^k$$</p>

"2384639","2385009","Bootstrap confidence interval in R using 'replicate' and 'quantile'","<p>I have around one thousand measurements (numbers). All these measurements are my observations and I have calculated a 95% confidence interval for the mean and for the variance by using the normal formulas (without software).</p>

<p>Then, I have used the replicate function in R with around one hundred thousand simulations for my measurements (observations) and the parameter ""replace"" has been set to ""true"".</p>

<p>After that, I used the apply function with the three parameters: my measurements as the data, 2 as the margin and mean as the function.</p>

<p>Then to get a 95% confidence interval this way, I used the quantile function containing the variable for the apply function I used, and then 0.025 and 0.975 combined as the second parameter for the quantile function.</p>

<p>In that way, I got almost exactly the same 95% confidens interval as calculated with the normal formula (without software).</p>

<p>So now I wanted to do exactly the same thing for the variance, i.e. use replicate, apply and quantile to get a 95% confidence interval for the variance. So I just changed the third parameter ""mean"" to ""var"" in the apply function. I then noticed that the outputted 95% confidence interval for the variance (from the quantile function) is a little bit different (it is wider) than the one I calculated by the normal formula without software.</p>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<p>Did I use the replicate, apply and quantile function correctly for the variance confidence interval? I know I did use the functions right for the mean, since I got almost exactly the same result there as calculated by normal formula.</p>

<p>If I did use the functions correctly for the variance, why is the confidence interval a little bit different? Is it because as sample size increases, there might be more observations far away from the mean resulting in a bigger variance?</p>

<p>Let $U\subseteq Y$ be open. Then
$$
U=\text{int}(U)=\text{int}\Big(f\big(f^{-1}(U)\big)\Big)\subset f\Big(\text{int}\big(f^{-1}(U)\big)\Big).
$$
Thus $f^{-1}(U)\subset\text{int}\big(f^{-1}(U)\big)$. (Here is the issue. We only have $f^{-1}(f(A))\supset A$ for every set $A$, with equality when $f$ injective.) Thus $\text{int}\big(f^{-1}(U)\big)=f^{-1}(U)$ and hence $f^{-1}(U)$ is open. Thus $f$ is continuous. </p>

<p>I've also tried other approaches, but all of them seem to require me to have $f$ injective. I'm starting to think the statement may not even be true. Does anyone have a proof or counterexample of this? Thanks</p>

<p>I came to that conclusion by using an equation to calculate the remainder: for $a\bmod{n}$, $r = a - n\lfloor{\frac{a}{n}}\rfloor$.

<p>Where P and Q are predicates. I was told these two are logically equivalent only if P(x) is bound. So let's bound P(x) with a ∃.</p>

<p>Let the domain be natural numbers. Let <code>Q(x) : x&gt;=0</code> and <code>P(x) : x/2 is even number</code>. So far so good?</p>

<p><code>Q(x)</code> is bound, and says for all x, <code>x&gt;= 0</code> which is true. <code>P(x)</code> is bound by <code>∃</code> and says there exists an integer in natural numbers which is even when divided by 2, which is true (12/2 = 6).</p>

<p>My question is, the x in P(x) was bound with ∃, but when it was moved into <code>∀x(P(x)∧Q(x))</code>, it is now bound by ∀, which makes the statement not true, right? Because not all x are even when divided by 2?</p>

<p>To prove these two are not logically equivalent, I will take an x which makes <code>P(x) ∧ ∀xQ(x)</code> true and <code>∀x(P(x)∧Q(x))</code> false (am I on the right track)?</p>

<p>Take <code>x = 12</code>. <code>P(x) ∧ ∀xQ(x)</code> is true because 12 divided by 2 is even, and 12>=0. But <code>∀x(P(x)∧Q(x))</code> is false because it states that <code>∀x(P(x)</code> so even though 12 holds true, it is not true for 11.</p>

"2384915","2385796","Smooth classification of vector bundles","<p>I am trying to understand the smooth classification of $n$-disk bundles over $S^n$. As vector bundles, these are classified by $\pi_{n-1}(SO(n))$ via the clutching construction but I am interested in their smooth type. For example, the map $\pi_{n-1}(SO(n)) \rightarrow \pi_{n-1}(Diff(D^n))$ might not be injective in which case two distinct vector bundles would be the same as smooth manifolds. What is known about the smooth type of these bundles? 
The homology of the total space is just $\mathbb{Z}$ in degree $0, n$ and the intersection form is determined by a single integer, which equals $HJ: \pi_{n-1}(SO(n)) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$, where $J: \pi_{n-1}(SO(n)) \rightarrow \pi_{2n-1}(S^n)$ and $H: \pi_{2n-1}(S^n) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ is the Hopf invariant. </p>

<p>These $n$-disk bundles over $S^n$ also correspond to handlebodies with a single critical point of index 0 and n and are $(n-1)$-connected $2n$ manifolds as studied by Wall. Wall came up with an invariant of handlebody presentations; in the case of these disk bundles, Wall's invariant is just an element of $\pi_{n-1}(SO(n))$. However, as explained earlier, these don't seem to be really diffeomorphism invariants  (although Wall calls them that..). The problem is that Wall's invariant is invariant under handleslides (change of basis) but he seems to ignore the possibility of birth-death moves that create cancelling $n-1, n$ handles and then more handleslides. Am I correct in thinking this? </p>

perfect.  We have in $\kappa \to 0$ limit $ \textbf E = -\nabla \phi = \frac{4\pi}{3} \textbf r$. That looks consistent with the second approach.</p>

One of the upgradeable attributes is the probability that a given block will bounce off the paddle (where, if a bounce fails, the block is 'absorbed' and disappears). This sets up what should be a fairly simple probability problem: </p>

<p>If a block bounces with probability P, and will bounce consecutively until it disappears, what is the expected number of bounces for the block?</p>

<p>My initial heuristics say that a bounce probability of 0.5 results in a single expected bounce, and to note that a probability of 1 results in an infinite number of bounces. At first I thought that the bounces were independent of one another, and so I took the expected number of bounces to be ln(0.5)/ln(P), since  0.5 is my heuristic threshold for expecting a bounce to succeed. However I think this solution may be a bit too glib and a bit unsatisfying, since the bounces are really not independent at all (since bounce N only occurs if bounce N-1 did, and so forth).</p>

Firstly, to explain the situation, I need to know how the area of a circle can change as you view it from different angles. For example, if you were viewing a circle at a 0 degree angle, it would look like a circle and it's area would be $\pi r^2$. However, as the angle of observation increases or decreases, one side of the circle will ""collapse"" inwards, and become smaller. It would create an ellipse, where the variable 'a' (longest distance from centre to side) stays the same, and where variable 'b' (the smallest distance from centre to side) decreases. I want to know the best way to find the area, based on the angle theta. For clarification, theta refers to the angle from a line perpendicular to the circle. The best way to approach the issue seemed to be the diagram in the link.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/30ZE3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/30ZE3.png"" alt=""Diagram""></a></p>

<p>In the diagram, the 2 cm long line, is the circle. Therefore, the radius is 1 cm. The best approach I could find, was by using a cos ratio in the triangle highlighted in red as whenever I try any trig rules, it always gets too complicated with multiple variables. The angle closest to the centre of the circle would have to be 90-theta and, if the triangle is right angle (which it was made to be this way), the opposite angle must be theta. Hence by using $\cos \theta = a/h$, where h is the 1cm line, 'a' (which refers to adjacent not the other longer 'a') must be cos theta. This only works if the entire line is 2a. But if it's not and either side is different, then I have a problem. So, I wanted to know, am I right with the above working, or am I wrong. And if I'm wrong, how should I approach this problem differently. Thanks.</p>

<p>My Proof: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, we suppose that $p=1$. Then since 
  $$ \lvert f+g \rvert \leq \lvert f \rvert + \lvert g \rvert $$ 
  on $[a, b]$, therefore  we have 
  $$ \int_a^b \lvert f+g \rvert  \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \leq \int_a^b \lvert f  \rvert \ \mathrm{d} \alpha + \int_a^b \lvert g \rvert  \ \mathrm{d} \alpha, $$
  by Theorem 6.12 (b) in Rudin. This is (0) with $p = 1$. </p>
  
  <p>Now suppose that $p &gt; 1$. </p>
  
  <p>If $ \int_a^b \lvert f+g \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha = 0$, then the LHS of (0) equals zero, and since the RHS of (0) is non-negative (by Theorem 6.12 (b) in Rudin), therefore (0) holds. </p>
  
  <p>So we suppose that $ \int_a^b \lvert f+g \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \neq  0$.  Then we in fact have 
  $$ \int_a^b \lvert f+g \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha &gt;  0, \tag{1} $$
  by Theorem 6.12 (b) in Rudin. </p>
  
  <p>Let $q$ be a positive real number such that $1/p + 1/q = 1$. Then 
  $$ p+q = pq, $$
  and so 
  $$ pq - p - q + 1 = 1,$$
  that is 
  $$ (p-1)(q-1) = 1;$$
  therefore 
  $$ (p-1)q = (p-1)(q-1+1) = (p-1)(q-1) + (p-1) = 1 + (p-1) = p. \tag{2} $$</p>
  
  <p>So, 
  $$
\begin{align}
\int_a^b \lvert f+g \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha &amp;= \int_a^b \lvert f + g \rvert \, \lvert f+g \rvert^{p-1} \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \qquad \mbox{ [ note that $p &gt; 1 $ ] } \\
&amp;\leq \int_a^b \left( \lvert f \rvert + \lvert g \rvert \right) \lvert f+g \rvert^{p-1} \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \qquad \mbox{ [ using Theorem 6.12 (b) in Rudin ] } \\
&amp;= \int_a^b \lvert f \rvert \, \lvert f+g \rvert^{p-1} \ \mathrm{d} \alpha + 
 \int_a^b \lvert g \rvert \, \lvert f+g \rvert^{p-1} \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \\
&amp; \qquad \qquad \mbox{ [ using Theorem 6.12 (a) in Rudin ] } \\
&amp;\leq \left( \int_a^b \lvert f \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/p} \left( \int_a^b \left\lvert \lvert f+g \rvert^{p-1} \right\rvert^q \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/q} \\
&amp; \qquad + \left( \int_a^b \lvert g \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/p} \left( \int_a^b \left\lvert \lvert f+g \rvert^{p-1} \right\rvert^q \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/q} \\
&amp; \qquad \mbox{ [ by Holder's inequality for integrals, or Prob. 10 (c), Chap. 6, in Rudin ] } \\
&amp;= \left( \int_a^b \lvert f \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/p} \left( \int_a^b \lvert f+g \rvert^{(p-1)q}  \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/q} \\
&amp; \qquad +  \left( \int_a^b \lvert g \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/p} \left( \int_a^b \lvert f+g \rvert^{(p-1)q} \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/q} \\
&amp;= \left[ \left( \int_a^b \lvert f \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/p}  + \left( \int_a^b \lvert g \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/p}  \right] \left( \int_a^b \lvert f+g \rvert^{(p-1)q} \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/q} \\
&amp;= \left[ \left( \int_a^b \lvert f \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/p}  + \left( \int_a^b \lvert g \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/p}  \right] \left( \int_a^b \lvert f+g \rvert^{p} \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/q}. \\
&amp; \qquad \qquad \mbox{ [ using (2) above ] }
\end{align}
$$</p>
  
  <p>Thus we have shown that 
  $$ \int_a^b \lvert f+g \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \leq \left[ \left( \int_a^b \lvert f \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/p}  + \left( \int_a^b \lvert g \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/p}  \right] \left( \int_a^b \lvert f+g \rvert^{p} \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/q}. \tag{3} $$
  And as 
  $$ \int_a^b \lvert f+g \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha &gt; 0, $$ 
  by (1) above, so 
  $$ \left( \int_a^b \lvert f+g \rvert^{p} \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/q} &gt; 0 $$
  as well; dividing (3) out by this integral we obtain 
  $$ \frac{\int_a^b \lvert f+g \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha }{\left( \int_a^b \lvert f+g \rvert^{p} \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/q} } \leq  \left( \int_a^b \lvert f \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/p}  + \left( \int_a^b \lvert g \rvert^p \ \mathrm{d} \alpha \right)^{1/p}.  $$
  which is the same as (0) above, because $1 - 1/q = 1/p$. </p>

<p>prove that if $ \vec{x} ,\vec{y}$ are not parallel then a=c and b=d. </p>

<p>My thought process.</p>

<p>i) First i tried Leaning on the fact that if $ \vec{x} ,\vec{y}$ are not parallel must mean that $ \vec{x} ,\vec{y}$ are linearly independent for some reason the idea that no linear combination of the two vectors is the zero vector except 0 of both of them is important. i can see this in the case when one is simply a scalar multiple of anther but when they start at different points im a bit lost.</p>

<p>ii) Second idea the concept of vector space's have a list of specific rules that would help a lot but this still leaves the problem of showing that parallel means that all linear combinations of these two vectors does not form a vector space still leaves a loose end.</p>

<p>iii) so i tried going straight to abstract algebra i eventually came to the conclusion that vector spaces were a field with the binary operations of addition and scalar multiplication and simply a commutative ring  with unity with respect to the dot product </p>

<p>iv) I have come to the conclusion that what i want to prove to start is that $a_1  \vec{x} + a_2 \vec{y}=0 $ iff $ a_1=a_2=0 $ And that only for some non-zero $ a_1 , a_2 $ can this equal 0 iff $ \vec{x} , \vec{y} $ are parallel.</p>

<p>For example  $
   \vec{x}=
  \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   1 \\
   1 \\
  \end{array} } \right]
$ and  $
   \vec{y}=
  \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   2 \\
   2 \\
  \end{array} } \right]
$ 
then $ a_1=-2 a_2 $ will always yield the zero vector even when $ a_2 \neq 0 $</p>

<p>This seems to be a step in the right direction though it does not prove that for all parallel vectors so i still can't assume the opposite is true for for all non-parallel vectors.</p>

<p>v) My last attempt is to use a logical argument as math seems to be failing me completely here. so lets first assume that $ \vec{x} ,\vec{y}$ are perpendicular clearly a scalar multiple of a vector laying entirely on the x axis for example can ever make a vector in the direction of the y axis and any all other perpendicular vectors is simply a rotation of this case. so i we have that $a_1 =a_2 =0 $ is the only possible choice that will result in $ a_1 \vec{x} = -a_2 \vec{y}$ this logic seems to imply that in the perpendicular case that $a  \vec{x} + b \vec{y}=c  \vec{x} + d \vec{y}$ or $(a-c)  \vec{x} + (b-d) \vec{y}=0$ since (a-c) is simply a scalar and (b-d) is also a scalar clearly a-c= 0 or a=c and (b-d)=0 or b=d  showing the desired result.</p>

<p>Well clearly not parallel and perpendicular are not the same thing but if two vectors are not parallel then we should be able to subtract a scalar multiple of the first from the second to remove all of the second vectors x direction leaving it with only a y direction and 0 x axis direction. we can then use this new vector to remove some scalar multiple from the first one to remove all of its y component leaving us with two new vectors that are perpendicular, which i believe implies that the there is no scalar combination of those two vectors that yields zero except both scalars being 0. implying the truth of the last result in this case as well.</p>

<p>Clearly this is not the proper way of doing this and it feels more like a logic argument (perhaps full of many holes) rather than a mathematical proof. Could someone prove this in a more formula capacity?</p>

= 2(a^2_n + b^2_n + c^2_n + d^2_n) - 2a_{n}b_{n}  - 2b_{n}c_{n} - 2c_{n}d_{n}  - 2d_{n}a_{n}.\tag{1}$</p>

<p>Now, since $a_{n} + b_{n} + c_{n} + d_{n} = 0$, then</p>

<p>$0 = (a_{n} + b_{n} + c_{n} + d_{n})^2 = (a_n + c_n)^2  + (b_n + d_n)^2 + 2a_{n}b_n + 2a_{n}d_n + 2b_{n}c_n + 2c_{n}d_n.\tag{2}$</p>

<p>Okay, I under the steps above, what what I don't understand is this:</p>

<p>Adding (1) and (2) for $a^2_{n+1} + b^2_{n+1} + c_{n+1}^2 + d^2_{n+1}$ we get</p>

<p>$2(a^2_n + b^2_n + c^2_n + d^2_n) + (a_n + c_n)^2 + (b_n + d_n)^2 ≥ 2(a^2_n + b^2_n + c^2_n + d^2_n).\tag{3}$</p>

<p>From this invariant relationship, we conclude for $n≥2$</p>

<p>$a^2_n + b^2_n + c^2_n + d^2_n ≥ 2^{n-1}(a^2_1 + b^2_1 + c^2_1 + d^2_1) . \tag{4}$</p>

<p>Hence, the distance of the point $P_n$ from origin increases without bound, which means that at least one of the component will become arbitrary large.</p>

  <p>show that the locus of the middle points of chords of parabola $$y^2 = 4ax$$
   passing through the vertex is a parabola?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Solution</p>

<p>the Vertex is $O(0.0)$, which is one end of the chord. Let the other end be a varaible point $P$ given by $(at^2,2at)$.</p>

<p>Let $M(p,q)$ be the midpoint of the chord $OP$. Midpoint of $OP$ is $(at^2/2,at)$.</p>

<p>So, </p>

<p>$$p = \frac{at^2}{2}$$ and $$q = at$$</p>

<p>Now we have to eliminate $t$ and get the relation between $p$ and $q$ to get the locus.</p>

<p>So,</p>

<p>$$t = \frac{q}{a}$$</p>

<p>Substitute this in the equation of $p$, and we will get:</p>

<p>$$p = \frac{a}{2}\left(\frac{q}{a}\right)^2$$</p>

<p>So we have,
$$q^2 = 2ap$$</p>

<p>Which is a parabola of the form $y^2 = 2ax$</p>

<p>My question is :
what is the variable $t$ , why it has been introduced in the solution, and how the coordinate of point $P(at^2,2at)$ have been obtained?</p>

<p>can this problem  be solved  without using parametric equations of parabola since it is not included in the curriculum?</p>

I'd like to obtain bounds of the form $$\left|\int_{\mathbb R^d}x_1^n\,p(x)\mathrm \,dx\right|\leq C(n)\left(\frac{3n}{4}\right)!\qquad\qquad (\star)$$ with $C(n)$ possibly growing exponentially in $n$ (and ideally independent of the dimension, $d$) and where I've used the Gamma function to define the factorial.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Some comments about why I think the bound may hold</strong>. Firstly, note that $$\exp(-\|x\|^2)\leq p(x)\leq \exp(-\|x\|),$$ at least for large $\|x\|$, and the moments of $\exp(-\|x\|^2)$ grow like $n!!\simeq(n/2)!$ (possibly up to an exponential factor, which I don't mind). And, moments of $\exp(-\|x\|)$ grow like $n!$, so I hope that moments of $p(x)$ lie somewhere in between.</p>

<p>Secondly, if $d=1$, 
\begin{align}M_n:&amp;=\int_\mathbb R|x|^n\exp(-|x|^{4/3})dx\\
&amp;=\int_\mathbb R-\frac{4}{3}|x|^{n-1/3}\frac{d}{dx}\exp(-|x|^{4/3})dx\\
&amp;\stackrel{\mathrm{IBP}}{=}\int_\mathbb R\frac{4}{3}(n-\frac{1}{3})|x|^{n-4/3}\exp(-|x|^{4/3})dx = \frac{4}{3}(n-\frac{1}{3})M_{n-\frac{4}{3}},
\end{align}
this suggests we can inductively/recursively obtain a bound of the form $|M_n|\leq C\cdot\left(\frac{3n}{4}\right)!$.</p>

<p>I would greatly appreciate any help making the above precise and completing the argument for arbitrary $d\in\mathbb N$ (if the bound holds at all!).</p>

<p>Suppose towards a contradiction that there are two solutions $x_1 = b^r$ and $x_2 = b^s$ to the congruence $x^k \equiv b \bmod m$. Then $$x_1^k \equiv x_2^k \equiv b \bmod m$$</p>

<p>There are six cards in a deck, labeled A$_1$, A$_2$, B$_1$, B$_2$, B$_3$, and C. Assuming this deck is well-shuffled, what is the probability of drawing at least one 'A' and at least one 'B' card in a 3-card draw with no replacement?</p>

n \\ k

2 \\ 1

3 \\ 1 
\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ combinations to draw one 'B,' and the last draw can be any of the remaining four cards so $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 
4 \\ 1 
\end{smallmatrix}\right)$. The total number of combinations is $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}

"2385654","2386033","The Definition of Ordinals and the Axiom of Regularity","<p>In the first edition of his set theory textbook, Pinter defines an ordinal number to be a set which is transitive and (strictly) well-ordered by the membership relation $\in$. I believe this is the most common way of defining ordinals. Then he proves many wonderful things without invoking the axiom of regularity (foundation).</p>

<p>However, in the revised edition from Dover, his definition changes! He drops the well-orderedness and says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A set $A$ is called an ordinal if $A$ is transitive and ordered by $\in$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where, by 'ordered' he means 'strictly ordered'. Moreover, his first theorem on ordinals goes like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>9.27 Theorem</strong> Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be ordinals. If $\alpha\ne\beta$, then either $\alpha\in\beta$ or $\beta\in\alpha$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and his proof makes use of the axiom of regularity on the following subclass $A$ of $\text{OR}$, where $\text{OR}$ denotes the class of all ordinals. $$A=\{x\in\text{OR}:\exists y\in\text{OR},\text{ such that }x\text{ and }y\text{ are incomparable}\}.$$</p>

<p>The problem is, we don't know whether $A$ is a set or a proper class in this situation, so that the axiom of regularity might not be applicable. The book just says ""Let $A$ be the following subSET of $\text{OR}$..."" and I'm very confused here.</p>

<p>So my questions are</p>

<ol>
<li>Is the class $A$ above necessarily a set?</li>
<li>Is there a short proof that dropping the well-orderedness on the definition of ordinals does not affect the theory? Perhaps assuming the axiom of regularity if necessary?</li>
</ol>

<p>The user's viewport width is $w$ and his viewport height is $h$.</p>

<p>The camera's focal length is $f$, the focal width is $w_f$ and focal height is $h_f$. </p>

<p>Vectors can be represented in the four coordinate systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>the viewport coordinate system (in pixels) ($x_p$),</li>
<li>the film coordinate system ($x_f$),</li>
<li>the camera coordinate system ($x_c$),</li>
<li>the world coordinate system ($x_w$).</li>
</ul>

<p>And converted via the following transformation equations:</p>

<ul>
<li>$x_f = T_{f \leftarrow p} x_p$</li>
<li>$x_c = T_{c\leftarrow f} x_f = T_{c\leftarrow f} T_{f\leftarrow p} x_p $</li>
<li>$x_w = T_{w\leftarrow c}x_c = T_{w\leftarrow c}T_{c\leftarrow f} T_{f\leftarrow p} x_p$</li>
</ul>

<p>As a user drags his mouse on the screen from the initial position $p_i$ to the final position $p_f$, I want to find the transformation $T_{w\leftarrow c}$ such that</p>

<ol>
<li>$p_{i_{world}} = p_{f_{world}}$</li>
<li>The up direction is maintained</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, the point in the world under the mouse ""follows"" the mouse as it is being dragged and the camera does not experience roll about the ""look at"" vector. Similar to how your pointer follows your finger while panning on google maps, but in 3D with a fixed camera looking at a 3D picture. </p>

<p><strong>Here's what I got so far:</strong></p>

<p>In this situation, $T_{c\leftarrow f}$ and $T_{f\leftarrow p}$ are constant since the camera's film size, the camera's focal length and the viewport size are constant. </p>

<p>This means that provided I know the initial mouse position $p_{i_{pixels}}$ and final mouse positions $p_{f_{pixels}}$. Then (1) can be rexpressed as</p>

<p>$$ p_{i_{world}} = T_{f_{w \leftarrow c}} p_{f_{camera}} $$</p>

<p>Since I can calculate both $p_{i_{world}}$ and $p_{f_{camera}}$, then I can find an axis-angle representation of $T_{f_{w \leftarrow c}}$. </p>

<p>$$ \theta = \cos^{-1} \left( \frac{ a \cdot b }{ |a| |b| } \right) $$
$$ \hat{n} = \frac {a \times b} {| a \times b |} $$</p>

<p>Where $a = p_{i_{world}}$ and $b = p_{f_{camera}}$.</p>

<p>I can turn that into a quaternion if I want, but if I apply that to my camera, I lose condition (2) and the user experiences some dizzying roll of his camera. </p>

<p>What kind of transformation should I do to get a $T_{w \leftarrow c}$ that maintains the up condition and $p_{i_{world}} = p_{f_{world}}$?</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional with $\dim V \ge 2$. Prove that there exist
$S,T\in\mathcal{L}(V,V)$ such that $ST \neq TS$.</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Since $V$ is <em>finite-dimensional</em>  and $\dim V = m\ge 2$ it follows that there exist a list of vectors $v_1,v_2,...,v_m$ basis for $V$, arguing from cases</p>

<p><em>Case-1$(m =2)$</em>: Consider the linear transformations $S$ and $T$ defined as follows
$$Tv_1=v_1,\ Tv_2=0$$ 
$$Sv_1=v_2,\ Sv_2 = v_1$$
consequently 
$$S(Tv_1)=Sv_1=v_2,\ S(Tv_2)=S(0) = 0$$
$$T(Sv_1)=Tv_2=v_1,\ T(Sv_2)=Tv_1 = v_1$$
evidently $ST\neq TS$.</p>

<p><em>Case-2$(m &gt; 2)$</em>: Consider now the linear transformations $S$ and $T$ defined by 
$$Tv_{j}=v_{m-j+1}$$
$$Sv_{j}=v_{j\bmod m+1}$$
consequently 
$$T(Sv_j) = v_{m-(j\bmod m+1)+1}$$
$$S(Tv_j) = v_{(m-j+1)\bmod m+1}$$</p>

<p>Assume now that there exists some $j\in\{1,2,...,m\}$ such that 
$$m-(j\bmod m+1)+1=(m-j+1)\bmod m+1$$
but then</p>

<p>$$\implies m-(j\bmod m+1)=(m-j+1)\bmod m$$
$$\implies m-(j\bmod m)-1=(m-j+1)\bmod m$$
$$\implies m-1=(m-j+1)\bmod m+(j\bmod m)$$
$$\implies m-1=(m-j+1+j)\bmod m$$
$$\implies m-1=(m+1)\bmod m$$
$$\implies m-1=1$$
$$\implies m=2$$</p>

<p>resulting in a contradiction we may now conclude that 
$$\forall j\in\{1,2,...,m\}(S(Tv_j)\neq T(Sv_j))$$
implying that $ST\neq TS$.</p>

"2386079","2386083","Question about composition in the category $ \textbf{Rel} \ $","<p>I have a question concerning the composition of morphisms in the category $ \textbf{Rel} \ $. </p>

<p>First, for categories generally, it is frequently stated that if $ f \colon A \to B $ and $ g \colon B \to C $ , i.e., if cod(f) = dom (g), the morphisms must compose in order to fit the definition of a category.</p>

<p>However, the category  $ \textbf{Rel}\  $ seems to have an additional requirement for composition (or perhaps an additional requirement for being a valid category). $ \textbf{Rel}\ $ is of course the category of relations with sets as objects and where the morphism $ f \colon A \to B $  is a set $ R \subseteq A \times B $.  Similarly, the morphism $ g \colon B \to C $ is a set $ S \subseteq B \times C$ .</p>

<p>In this category the composition is given by $ S \circ R = \lbrace (a,c) \in A \times C \mid \exists b \mid ((a,b) \in R $ and $ (b,c) \in S ) \rbrace $.</p>

<p>My question concerns this composition.  Is it not longer correct to say that the composition will necessarily exist if cod(f) = dom(g)? Or does composition always exist if cod(f)=dom(g) but in this case we have an additional requirement so that the category will always make sense?  Also, to what extent can a null set in a situation like this be considered a valid composition?</p>

"2386212","2386852","Central extensions versus semidirect products","<p>Consider an extension $E$ of a group $G$ by an abelian group $A$.
$$1 \to A \overset{\iota}{\to} E \overset{\pi}{\to} G \to 1$$
Two special kinds of extensions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Central Extensions:  $A$ is contained in the centre of $E$.</li>
<li>Semidirect products: $\pi$ has a section, i.e. a homomorphism $s : G \to E$ with $\pi \circ s = \mathrm{id}_G$. </li>
</ul>

<p>It perhaps reasonable to think of these two types of extensions as ""orthogonal"" since an extension is both central and a semidirect product if and only if it is split, i.e. there is an isomorphism $E \cong A \times G$ through which $
\iota$ and $\pi$ become identified with the standard inclusion and projection. </p>

<p>These two types of extensions are nice in the sense that we can construct all of them in terms of certain external data, namely 2-cocycles and actions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Given $\psi:G \times G \to A$ satisfying $\psi(g_1,g_2)  \psi(g_1 g_2,g_3) = \psi(g_1,g_2 g_3)\psi(g_2,g_3),$ we can devise an extension $E_\psi = A\times G$ with product $(a_1,g_1)(a_2,g_2)=(a_1a_2\psi(g_1,g_2),g_1g_2),$ and $\iota,\pi$ given by the standard inclusion and projection. </li>
<li>Given a homomorphism $\theta:G \to \mathrm{Aut}(A)$, define $E=A \rtimes_\theta G$ to be $A \times G$ with product $(a_1,g_1)(a_2,g_2) = (a_1 \theta_{g_1}(a_2),g_1g_2)$. </li>
</ul>

<p>Since the cases of central extensions and semi-direct product are somehow ""orthogonal"", I am tempted to ask the following ill-defined question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Main Question:</strong> Can we think of <em>all</em> extensions $E$ of a group $G$ by an abelian group $A$ as being somehow built out of these two orthogonal cases of central extensions and semidirect products?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and maybe</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Followup Question 1:</strong> Can arbitrary extensions be constructed out of external data in the same way as central extensions and semidirect products? The data would need to be something which mixes the notions of a 2-cocycle and an action. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>One further question, a bit frivolous, just popped into mind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Followup question 2:</strong> If we want to study extensions $A \to E \to G$ where $A$ is <em>nonabelian</em>, we can still talk about the extensions which are semidirect products. However, the notion of a central extension no long makes any sense. Is there a property $(P)$ which is an appropriate analogue of central extension in this context? Can $(P)$ be chosen so that the trivial split extension is the only extensions which satisfies $(P)$ and is also a semidirect product?</p>

<p>For $x_{3}$, we continue to choose either $1\ P$ or $1\ E$, which gives me $$(|P - 2| + |E|) + ( |P - 1| + |E - 1|)+ (|P - 1| + |E - 1|) + (|P| + |E-2|)\\ = (1+2)+(2+1)+(2+1)+(3+0) = 12$$ possible choices.</p>

"2386360","2386503","Spivak calculus chapter 3 problem 6 function","<p>I am still working on Spivak calculus and at problem 6 of the third chapter, I came across an exercise that has been confusing me for a couple hours. I understand the solution (well, I understand how I got there but I have no idea what my solution represents). If someone could enlighten me it would be so great.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>If $x_1,....,x_n$ are distinct numbers, find a polynomial function $f_i$ of degree $n-1$ which is 1 at $x_i$ and $0$ at $x_j$ for $j\neq i  $.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<p>If I understand well, there is only one $x_i$ such that $fi(x) = 1$ (correct me if I'm wrong)</p>

<p>Moreover, for every $x_j$ such that $j \neq i$, the function must be equal to 0.</p>

<p>Therefore, the function should look like $k(x - x_1)(x-x_2)...(x-x_j)$ admitting $i \neq 1$ and $i \neq 2$</p>

<p>So, $f_i(x) = k \prod_{j = 1, j \neq i} ^n (x - x_j)$</p>

<p>And, if I want $f_i(x)$ to be $1$ at $x_i$, then I must fund a $k$ that allows it:</p>

<p>$f(x_i) = 1 = k\prod_{j = 1, j \neq i} ^n (x_i - x_j) \Rightarrow k =( \prod_{j = 1, j \neq i} ^n (x_i - x_j))^-1$</p>

<p>Finally, we find that </p>

<p>$f_i(x) = \prod_{j = 1, j \neq i} ^n \frac{(x - x_j)}{(x_i - x_j)}$</p>

<p><strong>My questions</strong></p>

<p>How does such a function pass many times by $0$ but only once does it equal $1$. I mean I think the other 1 would be for f(complex number) but still. If someone could enlighten me on how this is possible since when I make the graph the function is continue and passes by 1 many times but if I try to find the roots by lowering the function by 1 it says that the only real roots is 1..</p>

<p>Basically, I'd really like to know what kind of function I just constructed and why does it behave in such a weird way, and if i'm right to assume there is only 1 $x_i$ for which $f_i(x) = 1$</p>

<p>Then $V=W\bigoplus W^{\perp}$.</p>

<p>My proof follows from the intuition of inner product:
$W\bigoplus W^{\perp}:=\{x+y\mid x\in W, y\in W^{\perp}\}$, it's obvious that both $W$ and $W^{\perp}$ are subspaces of $W\bigoplus W^{\perp}$. So let $B=\{e_1,...e_k\}$ be the orthonormal basis of $W$ and $W^{\perp}$.
Suppose for a contradiction, $V\neq W\bigoplus W^{\perp}$. The we can extend the basis $B$ to $B'=\{e_1,...,e_n\}$ which is the orthonormal basis of $V$, and there exists some $e_j\in B'\setminus B$.</p>

<p>So $\langle e_j, e_i\rangle=0$ for every $e_i$ in the basis of $W$, but then I'm not sure how to proceed. The proof would be complete if the bilinear form is nondegenerate on the whole space $V$, but this is clearly not assumed.</p>

Coming from the EE background, I also know that you can construct any circuit using NAND/NOR gates, because of their nice functional completeness properties. The same goes for stateful circuits, as you could build a simple stateful RS-Latch with 2 NAND/NOR gates, by applying them to each other.<br>
This is where it gets interesting - does that mean that the state arises from the recursion? i.e.  </p>

<p>Edit: Here's my attempt at the first one, if someone could tell me if it's any good...</p>

<p>$\sum_{n=1}^\infty(n!)^2x^{n^2}$=$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nx^n$ where $a_n= 0$ for any $n\notin \{k\in N| \exists t\in N: k=t^2\}$ and $a_n = (n!)^2$ else. So the radius of convergence would be the inverse of $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}{(n!)^{2/n}}=\lim e^{2/n\cdot log(n!) }$. The exponent with log of factorial becomes a series, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{logn}{n}$ which diverges by comparison test with $\frac{1}{n}$, so the radius of convergence would be equal to $0$.</p>

<p>My approach:</p>

<p>$$ A^TA = \begin{bmatrix}
a^2 &amp; ab &amp; ac\\ 
ab &amp; b^2 &amp; bc\\ 
ac &amp; bc &amp; c^2

<p>So from these two properties we know that at least one eigenvalue must be $0$.
Solving $A^TA-\lambda I=0$ for $\lambda=0$ we get that $\dim(\text{ker}(A^TA))=2$. Since the algebraic multiplicity has to be equal to or larger than the geometric multiplicity and from $(2)$ we conclude that the algebraic multiplicity had to be equal to the geometric multiplicity. So we can say that $\lambda_1=a^2+b^2+c^2,\lambda_2=\lambda_3=0$.
And now we just need to find the eigenvectors for the corresponding eigenvalues.</p>

$$
\begin{cases}

<p><strong>The official solution</strong> regards this to be a finding extrema points problem, specifically the circle is regarded to be a restriction. Would it be correct to solve such exercise and not mention at all that we're finding function max/min?

"2386630","2386888","How lucky is it that direct limits of algebras are algebras on the direct limit of the underlying sets?","<p>One can describe direct and inverse limits of sets (which correspond respectively to colimits and limits of a certain functor, $I\to Set$, $I^{op}\to Set$ respectively, where $I$ is a directed partially ordered set). </p>

<p>But we also want to describe those limits for algebras, such as groups, rings, modules etc. </p>

<p>For these algebras, the forgetful functor $U: \mathcal{C}\to Set$ ($\mathcal{C} = \mathbf{Grp}, \mathbf{Rng}, R-\mathbf{Mod}$, etc.) is right-adjoint to the ""free-object"" functor, and so naturally it commutes with limits, in particular the underlying set of a profuct of algebras is the product of the underlying sets, the terminal object (when it exists) has a singleton as underlying set, etc. And for inverse limits, it is also normal that the underlying set of the inverse limit of a system of algebras is the inverse limit of the underlying sets.</p>

<p>But $U$ has in general no right-adjoint and so isn't left adjoint; so there's no reason to expect that it'd commute with colimits. In fact, very often, it doesn't : in $\mathbf{Grp}$ the coproduct is the free product, in $R-\mathbf{Mod}$, it's the product, etc. And sometimes, colimits don't even exist (while they do in $Set$) : coproducts sometimes don't exist. (EDIT: As pointed out in the comments, this last remark is actually wrong; varieties of algebras are cocomplete)</p>

<p>However, direct limits (which are actually colimits, as I already mentioned) always exist in varieties of algebras which are the ""natural"" categories of algebras, and in these, $U$ commutes with said direct limits (see Grätzer, <em>Universal Algebra</em> for instance, for a treatment of direct and inverse limits), which feels like it's just a lucky thing. </p>

  <p>Solve $y''+y=1+x^2$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First we can solve the homogeneous equation $y''+y=0$ using characteristic equation $m^2+1=0$ and we'll get $m=\pm i$.</p>

<p>Then the homogeneous solution is of form:
$$
y(x)=c_1\cos x+c_2\sin x
$$
We can guess that the particular solution will be of form $y_p=a+bx+cx^2$. Then $y''_p=2c$. </p>

<p>Now we can plug in those guesses:
$$
2c+a+bx+cx^2=1+x^2
$$
Comparing the coefficients we get that $c=1, a=1,b=0$ then $y_p=1+x^2$.</p>

<p><strong>However,</strong> the correct solution says $y_p=x^2-1$.</p>

"2386705","2386717","For coprime $p$ and $q$, what is the largest number $m$ that can not be written as $ap+bq$ for $a,b \geq 0$.","<p>This is a sub-problem that I am solving in light of a larger more general problem. I believe it is probably quite easy but I often struggle with number theory. Here is my theorem: the number $m$ is given as 
$$m = (p-1)(q-1)-1 = p(q-1) - q$$</p>

<p>What I can prove (I think) is that this is an upper bound for $m$. Here goes:</p>

<p>Suppose that $m$ is actually some larger number
$$\tilde{m} = p(q-1) - q + c$$
Then, as $\gcd(p,q) = 1$, by Bezout, there exist $a,b$ such that $c= ap+bq$ with $b &gt;0$ and $|a| &lt; \frac{q}{\gcd{p,q}}$. Now,
$$\tilde{m} = p (q- 1 +a) + (b-1)q. $$
Now by the bounds on $a$ and $b$ we have that $b-1 \geq 0$ and $q -1 + a \geq 0$, thereby $\tilde{m}$ does not meet the desired requirements.</p>

<p>So that is my proof so far, I believe it is correct. What remains is to show that the chosen $m = p(q-1) - q$ actually cannot be written as $ap+bq $ for $a,b \geq 0$. Off course in the representation I choose the coefficient for $q$ is $-1$ but I can't really see how I can rule out other representations for which the coefficients are non-negative.

"2386729","2389185","Relationship between $L_\infty$ and $L_2$ norms in time-domain and frequency-domain","<p>To find a way of bringing together a minimization problem defined in the time-domain with systems described in the frequency domain via transfer functions, and thus bridge the gap between norms defined for time-domain and frequency-domain quantities, I came across the following relationship in the literature:
\begin{equation}
\left\|y\left(\;\!\cdot\;\!\right)\right\|_{L_\infty}\leq\left\|G\left(\;\!\cdot\;\!\right)\right\|_{H_2}\left\|u\left(\;\!\cdot\;\!\right)\right\|_{L_2}.
\end{equation}
The norms $\left\|\;\!\cdot\;\!\right\|_{L_\infty}$ and $\left\|\;\!\cdot\;\!\right\|_{L_2}$ in the above expression refer to the norms on the usual spaces $L_\infty(-\infty,\infty)$ and $L_2(-\infty,\infty)$, respectively. The norm $\left\|\;\!\cdot\;\!\right\|_{H_2}$ is given by
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\left\|G\left(\;\!\cdot\;\!\right)\right\|_{H_2}=\left(\frac{1}{2\pi}\int^\infty_{-\infty}\left\|G\left(i\omega\right)\right\|^2_F \,d\omega\right)^{1/2},
\end{equation}
where $\left\|\;\!\cdot\;\!\right\|_{F}$ is the Frobenius norm.
It should be pointed out that, on denoting the Laplace transforms of $y\left(t\right)$ and $u\left(t\right)$ by $\hat y\left(s\right)$ and $\hat u\left(s\right)$, respectively, we have that
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\hat y\left(s\right)=G\left(s\right)\hat u\left(s\right).
\end{equation}
My question is: how do we derive the above inequality?</p>

<p>I can show that
\begin{equation}
\left\|y\left(\;\!\cdot\;\!\right)\right\|_{L_2}\leq\left\|G\left(\;\!\cdot\;\!\right)\right\|_{H_\infty}\left\|u\left(\;\!\cdot\;\!\right)\right\|_{L_2},
\end{equation}
since, e.g. in the case that $\hat y\left(s\right)$ and $\hat u\left(s\right)$ are scalars,
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\left\|y\left(\;\!\cdot\;\!\right)\right\|_{L_2}&amp;=\left\|\hat y\left(\;\!\cdot\;\!\right)\right\|_{L_2}\\
&amp;=\left(\frac{1}{2\pi}\int^\infty_{-\infty}\left|G\left(i\omega\right)\right|^2\left|\hat u\left(i\omega\right)\right|^2 \,d\omega\right)^{1/2}\\

&amp;=\left\|G\left(\;\!\cdot\;\!\right)\right\|_{H_\infty}\left\|\hat u\left(\;\!\cdot\;\!\right)\right\|_{L_2}\\

<blockquote>
  <p>Problem:</p>
  
  <p>For real n-by-n matrices $A,B$, suppose $xA+yB=I$ for non-zero real $x,y$ and $AB=0$.
  Prove $$det(A+B) = \frac{1}{x^{\text{rank}(A)}y^{\text{rank}(B)}}.$$</p>
  
  <p>Solution:</p>
  
  <p>Let $A'=xA$ and $B'=yB$.</p>
  
  <p>Then $A'+B'=I$ and $A'B'=0$.</p>
  
  <p>Then it follows that $A'=A'^2$ and $B'=B'^2$.</p>
  
  <p>So the minimal polynomials of $A'$ and $B'$ divides $x^2-x$.
  Thus the eigenvalues are $0$ or $1$. Therefore $A'$ and $B'$ are diagonalizable.
  Let $V,W$ be the eigenspace of $A'$, $B'$ respectively corresponding to the eigenvalue $1$.
  Then $\text{trace}(A')=\text{dim}(V)$ and $\text{trace}(B')=\text{dim}(W)$.</p>
  
  <p>(*) Also $\text{trace}(A')+\text{trace}(B')=n$.
  Thus $\text{dim}(V \cap W)=0$ and $R^n=V \oplus W$ (direct sum).</p>
  
  <p>(**) Thus 
  $$\text{det}(A+B)= \frac{1}{x}^{\text{dim}(V)} \frac{1}{y}^{\text{dim}(W)}=\frac{1}{x}^{\text{trace}(A')} \frac{1}{y}^{\text{trace}(B')}=\frac{1}{x^{\text{rank}(A)}y^{\text{rank}(B)}}$$</p>

<p>My work:</p>

<p>The Taylor's formula looks like this:</p>

<p>$$f(b) = f(a) + f'(a) (b-a) + \frac{f''(a) (b-a)^2 }{2!} + \frac{f'''(a) (b-a)^3 }{3!} + \frac{f^4(a) (b-a)^4 }{4!} + ......+ \frac{f^n(x_1) (b-a)^n }{n!} $$</p>

<p>But my book instructed me to use the Maclaurin's formula, which is just a special case of Taylor's formula when $ a = 0$, so the Maclaurin's formula looks like this (according to my understanding):</p>

<p>$$f(b) = f(0) + f'(0) (b) + \frac{f''(0) (b)^2 }{2!} + \frac{f'''(0) (b)^3 }{3!} + \frac{f^4(0) (b)^4 }{4!} + ......+ \frac{f^n(x_1) (b)^n }{n!} $$</p>

<p>I only need five terms of Maclaurin's formula as instructed in my book, so I got to differentiate the expression $e^x$ five times and listing them one by one. Fortunately, the 1st up to 5th derivative of $e^x$ is $e^x$.</p>

<p>Taking in five terms in Maclaurin's expansion of $e^x$and putting $x = \frac{1}{3}$, we have:</p>

<p>$$e^\frac{1}{3} = e^0 + e^0(\frac{1}{3}) + \frac{e^0(\frac{1}{3})^2}{2!} + \frac{e^0(\frac{1}{3})^3}{3!} + \frac{e^0(\frac{1}{3})^2}{4!} + R_5$$</p>

<p>which is equal to:</p>

<p>$$e^\frac{1}{3} = 1.395576132 + R_5$$</p>

<p>The value $1.395576132$ is from my calculator.</p>

<p>To determine the accuracy of the value of the expansion , given were the number of terms used, I need the so-called Lagrange's form of the reminder, which is expressed as:</p>

<p>$$R_n = \frac{b-a}{n!}f^n(x_1)$$</p>

<p>I was following the example given from the book, so I did this: $b-a = \frac{1}{3},$ $f^5 (x) = e^x.$ Plugging it into the Lagrange's form of the reminder, we get:</p>

<p>$$R_5 = \frac{(\frac{1}{3})^5}{5!}e^{x_1}$$</p>

<p>where $0 &lt; x_1 &lt; \frac{1}{3}$</p>

<p>The number $e^{x_1}$ must be less than $e^{\frac{1}{3}}$, and since $e^{\frac{1}{3}}$ &lt; $8^{\frac{1}{3}} = 2$, it follows that:</p>

<p>$$R_5 &lt; \frac{(\frac{1}{3})^5}{5!}(2) = 0.00006858$$ or $$R_5 = 0.00007$$</p>

<p>Hence the value of $e^{\frac{1}{3}}$, correct to four decimals, is $1.3956$.</p>

<p>My question is, in my book, the answer is $$R_5 &lt; 0.00005$$ How do you get the value of $R_5$? It's so close to my answer.</p>

We know that the fields $\mathbb{K}_1 = \mathbb{F}_q[x]/(f(x))$ and $\mathbb{K}_2 = \mathbb{F}_q[y]/(g(y))$ are isomorphic, but... </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is it true that the map $x\mapsto y$ is always an isomorphism?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is (trivially) true: the map is injective because $x\mapsto y$ is not the zero map ($y$ is not zero in $\mathbb{K}_2$) and it's clearly surjective because every element of $\mathbb{K}_2$ can be written as a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$ in $y$, which is the image of exactly the same polynomial in $x$.</p>

<p>I think the same argument generalizes easily to $\mathbb{F}(\alpha) \cong \mathbb{F}(\beta)$.</p>

<p>However, something that makes me feel a bit uncomfortable is that if $x\mapsto y$ is an isomorphism, then $x$ and $y$ must have the same minimal polynomial $h(t)$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and therefore, since $f(x)=0$ and $g(y) = 0$ in $\mathbb{K}_1$ and $\mathbb{K}_2$ respectively, $h(t)$ must divide both $f(t)$ and $g(t)$... </p>

<p>By the image in $\mathbb{Q}_p^{\times}$ of a number $n$ in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ I mean $n\times\lvert n\rvert_p$ for example the image of $24$ in $\mathbb{Q}_2^{\times}$ is $3$.</p>

<p>Now I'm led to believe that the 2-adics are something of a special case when it comes to convergence because uniquely their logarithm has a nontrivial kernel in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-principal units (and let me be clear, I have next to no idea what that means).

<p>I think, that $I$ is not a prime ideal, but a maximal ideal.</p>

<p>Maximal ideal:</p>

<p>I think, that $I$ is a maximal ideal.
Consider the ideal $(2,\sqrt{3})\supset (2)$. This inclusion holds, since $\sqrt{3}\notin (2)$.
I want to show, that $(2,\sqrt{3})=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{3}]$.</p>

<p>$(2,\sqrt{3})=\{2f+\sqrt{3}g|f,g\in\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{3}]\}$</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>This question follows two questions from the same problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Prove that $\int_cP\,dx+Q\,dy=0$ given curve $(x-3)^2+(y-3)^2=1$</li>
  <li>Calculate $\int_cP\,dx+Q\,dy$ if the curve is $c(t)=\langle 1-\cos t, \sin t\rangle$, $0\le\theta\le 2\pi$.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>First we see that $P_y=Q_x$ so it's a conservative field in the range except the point $(1,0)$ where the field is undefined. So in question 1) the integral automatically is $0$.</p>

<p>In the 2) question the integral is $2\pi$. </p>

<p>The correct answer is that the field $(P(x,y,Q(x,y))$ is not conservative because in the 2) question the integral was not equal to $0$.</p>

<p>This is extremely confusing to me. We clearly see that $P_y=Q_x$ which means the field is conservative! Now there's the point $(1,0)$ indeed I guess if the range includes that point then the field is not defined hence not conservative? But the answer depends on the range in that case. But the question doesn't explicitly mention the range.</p>

<p>The 'if' part was quite simple. However, the proof of the converse stated that, upon introducing $q \in U = X \setminus K$, and assuming that $X\setminus K$ is not open, then $B_{1/n} (q)$ is not contained within $U$ ($\forall n$). Hence $\exists x_n \in K \cap B_{1/n} (q)$, implying that $x_j \to q$, a contradiction.</p>

Also I don't fully see where my proof would fail if $q$ was even (other than the fact that $2$ does not divide $q-1$). Here is my proof:</p>

<p>Let $\gamma^t$ for some $0\leq t \leq q-1$ be the additive inverse of $1$ in $\mathbb{F}_q$, so $1+\gamma^t=0$. Then $\gamma^i +\gamma^{t+i}=0$ for all $0\leq i\leq q-2$ and in general we can write the additive inverse of an element as $-\gamma^i=\gamma^{t+i}$.</p>

<p>Then we have

<p>For example, someone said that you can't just choose an element from each set of the family because it's not clear how to choose them. But don't we have the same problem when the the family is finite? For non-empty sets $A$ and $B$, to prove that $A\times B$ is non-empty, we also have to choose an element $a\in A$ and $b\in B$. How come we don't need an axiom for that?</p>

<p>I try to understand what prevents us to go from the first statement to the second without axiom of choice. (As I'm learning set theory with the book of Halmos, I stick to his definitions. ) By his definition a function $f$ from $I$ to $X$ is a <strong>subset</strong> of $I\times X$ such that $\forall x,y\in X, \forall i\in I, (i,x)=(i,y)\implies x=y$. Assuming the first statement, we consider the ""collection"" (for want of a better word) $C$ of elements in $I\times \cup_{i\in I} X_i$, such that for all $(i,x)\in I\times \cup_{i\in I} X_i$, $(i,x)$ is in $C$ if and only if $x=x_i$. As far as I can see, the only reason why $C$ might not be a function that qualifies for the second statement is that the ""collection"" $C$ may not be a <strong>subset</strong> of $I\times \cup_{i\in I} X_i$. (I just realized today that a ""subcollection"" may not be a subset.) Is that where the problem is?</p>

<p>Finally, can we say that the syntax of first order logic can handle the case where the family is finite, but not in the infinite case?</p>

<p>I am using the notes from Prof. Orr Shalit.  If $A$ is a subspace of $C_{\mathbb{R}}(X)$ then it is said to be a subalgebra if for all $f, g \in A$, $fg \in A$. A subalgebra $A$ is said to separate points if for all $x, y \in X$, there exists some $f \in A$ such that $f(x) \neq f(y)$.  A subalgebra is said to be closed if it is a closed subset with respect to the metric.  We now the apply the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem.</p>

<p>The metric is the $\sup$ norm and $X=[0,1]$,
$A_N$ contains constants (with $n=0$).  If $f, g$ are in $A_N$ then $fg$ is in $A_N$ since the product of $$\cos kNx  \cdot \cos m N x = \dfrac{1}{2} [ \cos((k-m)Nx) + \cos((k+m)Nx) ]$$
will be in $A_N$.  For $N =1$, $k=1$ , $c_k \neq 0$, $f = \cos(x)$, we have $f(x) \neq f(y)$ for all $x \neq y \in [0,1]$. So $A$ separates points.</p>

<p>$G(q)=\cfrac{1}{1-q+\cfrac{q(1-q)^2}{1-q^3+\cfrac{q(1-q^2)^2}{1-q^5+\cfrac{q(1-q^3)^2}{1-q^7+\cfrac{q(1-q^4)^2}{1-q^9+\dots}}}}}$</p>

<p>and $kth$ partial convergent of the continued fraction</p>

<p>$\cfrac{1}{1-q+\cfrac{q(1-q)^2}{1-q^3+\cfrac{q(1-q^2)^2}{1-q^5+\cfrac{q(1-q^3)^2}{\ddots+\cfrac{q(1-q^k)^2}{1-q^{2k+1}}}}}}=\exp\Big(\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} (-1)^n\phi_{k}(n)\,q^n\Big)$</p>

<p>where $|q|\lt\frac{1}{4}$,and $\phi_{k}(n)$ is our symbol of choice that represents coefficients of the series(please note that it doesn't represent any standard function) depending on the $kth$ partial convergent $k\gt2$.</p>

<p>For $k\gt2$,every partial convergent of the continued fraction seems to have the property that:</p>

<p>For all values of $n$ but a few(that are exceptions to the rule) ,$\phi_{k}(n)$ is integer when $n$ is prime and non-integer when $n$ is composite.</p>

<p>For example on the $7th$ partial convergent of the continued fraction,there's only one exception $n=15$ in $1\lt n\lt200$</p>

<p>Formally we may call $\phi_{k}(n)$ an arithmetic function which returns an integer when $n$ is a prime number and non-integer when $n$ is a composite number for all natural numbers $n$ but a few for $k\gt2$.</p>

<p>So the question is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is $\phi_{k}(n)$ integer when $n$ is prime and non-integer when it is composite for all values of $n$ but a few for $k\gt2$? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We may be led to conjecture  that whenever $n=prime$,the arithmetic function $\phi_{k}(n)$ is always integer.</p>

<p>5.10. $R$ integral, $f=ax^n+\dots +a_1X+a_0$ primitive in $R[x]$. Suppose there is $\pi$ prime of $R$ and polynomials $\phi,\psi\in R[x]$ s.t $f=a\phi(x)^m+\pi\psi(x),m\in N$. Let $x\to \bar{x}\in R/(\pi)=\bar{R}$. Prove if $\bar{\phi}\in\bar{R}[x]$ is prime and $\bar{\psi}\neq 0($mod $\bar{\phi})$ then $f$ is irr in $R[x]$.</p>

<p>Under quotient map $f\to \bar{f}=\bar{a}\bar{\phi(x)}^n\neq 0$ as $f$ is primitive. If $\bar{f}=0$, then $\pi\vert a_i,a$ for all $i$ contradicts with primitiveness of $f$. Pass to $K[x]=Frac(R)[x]$ which is UFD. Suppose $f=gh$. I see that $\bar{g}=\epsilon \phi(x)^l$ and similarly for $\bar{h}=\epsilon'\phi(x)^{n-l}$ in $K[x]$. </p>

<li><p>What is the purpose for $\bar{\psi}\neq 0($mod $\bar{\phi})$? I would expect considering $\bar{R}[x]/(\bar{\phi})$ at some time point</p></li>
</ol>

<p>5.11 Let $f=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_0\in Z[x]$ and $a_0\neq 0$. $f$ factorizes linearly over complex number $C$. If there are $n-1$ roots of $f$ with absolute value less than 1, then $f$ is irreducible over $Z$.</p>

<p>Suppose $f$ is reducible over $Z[x]$ say $f=gh$. Since $C[x]$ is UFD, I know one of the polynomials, say $g$ will have all roots absolute value less than 1. Since $g\in Z[x]$, the constant coefficient of $g$ must be in $Z$ and its absolute value must be greater than or equal to 1. It looks like this problem is solved by norm map. </p>

<p>Basis-Step: For $n=1$ we have $F_1=F_0+2=(2^{2^0}+1)+2 = (2+1)+2=5$.</p>

<p>Inductive-Step: Assume now for an arbitrary $k\in\{1,2,3,...\}$ the following 
$$F_k = \left(\prod_{j=0}^{k-1}F_j+2\right)\tag{1}$$
consequently using $(1)$ we have 
$$\left(\prod_{j=0}^{k}F_j+2\right) = \left(\prod_{j=0}^{k-1}F_j\cdot F_k+2\right)=(F_k-2)\cdot F_k=(F_k)^{2}-2F_k+2\tag{2}$$

"2387338","2387434","Inconsistent interpretations for the second parameter of the Gamma distribution","<p>The following question is motivated by material from pages 358-364 of Blitzstein and Hwang's <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=z2POBQAAQBAJ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong><em>Introduction to Probability</em></strong></a>.  (NB: I have modified the book's notation in various places to make my question clearer.)</p>

<hr>

<p>First, suppose that $\{N_t\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}^+}$ is a family of r.v.s indexed by the set $\mathbb{R}^+$ of positive reals, and that for each $t \in \mathbb{R}^+$, we have $N_t \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda t)$, where $\lambda$ is an <em>unknown</em> parameter, independent of $t$.</p>

<p>Or, to put it in Bayesian terms, we have</p>

<p>$$
    N_t\mid\lambda \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda t)
$$</p>

<p>Now, take<sup>1</sup> $\mathrm{Gamma}(n_0, t_0)$ as the (conjugate) prior distribution for $\lambda$.  I.e.</p>

<p>$$
    \lambda \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(n_0, t_0)
$$</p>

<p>Starting from these assumptions, the authors derive (p. 362-364) the posterior distribution for $\lambda$ as</p>

<p>$$
    \lambda \mid (N_t = n) \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(n_0 + n, t_0 + t)
$$</p>

<p>Furthermore, authors derive (p. 364) the posterior expectation for $\lambda$ as</p>

<p>$$
    \operatorname{E}(\lambda \mid N_t = n) = \frac{n_0 + n}{t_0 + t}
$$</p>

<p>These results suggest that the first parameter of a $\mathrm{Gamma}$ distribution is akin to a <em>count</em> (of occurrences), and the second one is akin to an <em>length of time</em>.</p>

<p>Under this interpretation, the <em>prior</em> distribution $\mathrm{Gamma}(n_0, t_0)$ would be obtained from the total number of occurrences ($n_0$) observed over one or more intervals of time adding up to a total of $t_0$ (time units).  To get the <em>posterior</em> distribution, we update the parameters of the prior's $\mathrm{Gamma}$ by adding a number of occurrences ($n$) observed during a new interval of time of length $t$, so that now we have a total of $n_0 + n$ occurrences observed in a cumulative interval of length $t_0 + t$.</p>

<hr>

<p>On the other hand, on p. 358 the authors note that a $\mathrm{Gamma}(1, \nu)$ distribution is equivalent to an $\mathrm{Exponential}(\nu)$ distribution, defined as the distribution whose PDF is $f(t) = \nu e^{-\nu t}$.  In this case, the second parameter of the $\mathrm{Gamma}$ distribution seems to be behaving like a <em>rate</em> (occurrences per unit time), rather than a length of time.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm puzzled by these two radically different interpretations of the $\mathrm{Gamma}$ distribution's second parameter (first as a length of time, and later as a rate).</p>

<p>Is my reasoning above wrong?  If not, is there some way to unify or rationalize such divergent interpretations?</p>

<hr>

<p><sup><sup>1</sup> The book uses the convention that $\mathrm{Gamma}(a, b)$ is the distrubtion whose PDF is $f(x) = \frac{(b x)^a e^{-b x}}{x \Gamma(a)},\; x &gt; 0$.</sup></p>

<p>However, I still find it a bit confusing. I was wondering what a function which is $\mathbb{R}$-differentiable but not $\mathbb{C}$-differentiable would look like in the complex plane? And if the limit definition of differentiability is used, what goes wrong when we consider it a complex limit not a real limit? I.e., if $f$ is a $\mathbb{R}$-differentiable, such that the limit $$\lim_{(x,y)-&gt;(x_0,y_0)}\frac{f(x,y)-f(x_0,y_0)}{(x,y)-(x_0,y_0)}$$ exists, then what does this limit equal when the function is in the complex plane? I.e., if $z=x+iy, z_0=x_0+iy_0, f(x,y)=f(x+iy)$, then what is $$\lim_{z-&gt;z_0}\frac{f(z)-f(z_0)}{z-z_0}?$$
I know this limit must not exist if the function is not $\mathbb{C}$-differentiable, I'm just a bit confused as to why it doesn't exist. </p>

<p>What I am interested in is the converse. I know that the converse is not true. That is, there exist a short exact sequence with $M \cong M_1 \oplus M_2$ which does not split. I wish to construct such a counter example.</p>

<p>Consider $R=\mathbb{Z}$, $M_1=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ and $M'=\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$. Suppose we have a $\mathbb{Z}$-module $N$ such that $M_1\oplus N \cong N$ and $M' \oplus N \cong N$. Define $M= M'\oplus N$, and $M_2=M_1\oplus N$. Then
$$M_1\oplus M_2 \cong M_1 \oplus N \cong N \cong M' \oplus N = M$$
Then consider the sequence
$$0 \to M_1 \stackrel{f}{\to} M \stackrel{g}{\to} M_2 \to 0$$
where $f:M_1\to M=M''\oplus N$ is defined as $f(\bar{1})=(\bar{2},0)$ and $g: M \to M_2$ as $g(\bar{x},n)=(\bar{x},n)$. Then clearly $f$ is injective and $g$ is surjective and $\operatorname{Im} f = \operatorname{Ker} g$.</p>

<p>Suppose the ses splits. Then $h :M_2 \to M$ is such that $g\circ h =\operatorname{Id}_{M_2}$. But then
$$h(\bar{1},0) \in  g^{-1}(\bar{1},0)=\{\bar{1},0),(\bar{3},0)\}$$
But $2(\bar{1},0)=(\bar{2},0)$ and $2(\bar{3},0)=(\bar{2},0)$ in $M$. Thus
$$h(\bar{0},0)=2h(\bar{1},0)=(\bar{2},0)$$
which contradicts the fact that $h$ is a homomorphism. Thus the ses does not splits.</p>

"2387505","2387511","Formula to count pair of unique numbers","<p>Recently I came across a problem to count pair of equal number in a sequence.
Assume the sequence consist of $(1,2,2,3,4,3,5,3,)$
The pairs is
 $(2,2)$ 
$(3,3)$ index $4,6$
$(3,3)$ index $4,8$
$(3,3)$ index $6,8$
 So there are $4$ unique pairs in this sequence.
I realized number of unique integers in a sequence has a relation with a unique pairs.
For instance if there are two integer with same value then $1$ pair can be created.
If $3$ unique integers $3$ pairs
If $4$ unique integers $6$ pairs
If $5$ unique integers $10$ pairs
If $6$ unique integers $15$ pairs.
....
Unique pair on $N$ number can be calculated by N-1 + uniqe pair of N-1</p>

<p>Can I come to a formula to count this unique pairs?</p>

"2387525","2388067","Work Done in Raising a Liquid","<p>I was studying for some exams when I encountered this question:</p>

<p>A hemispherical tank of radius 6 feet is filled with water to a depth of 4 feet. Find the work done in pumping the water to the top of the tank.</p>

<p>My work:</p>

<p>I visualize the problem like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tc8qE.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tc8qE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I do know that $Work = Force \times distance .$ The work done by a variable force from $x= a$ to $x = b$ is: $$W = \int_a ^b F(x) dx$$</p>

<p>I'm getting the differential work $dW$: $$dW = dF \times x$$</p>

<p>The force $F$ is equal to specific volume of liquid $\times$ distance $\times$ area or in differential form: $$dF = w \times h \times dA$$</p>

<p>As seen in the figure above: $$dF = 62.4 \times y \times  \pi x^2 dy$$</p>

<p>Substituting this newly-found $dF$ to $dW$ described in the figure above:</p>

<p>$$dW = dF \times y $$
$$ dW= 62.4 \times y \times  \pi x^2 dy \times y$$</p>

<p>And since we are raising the water from the point $y = -2$ to $y = 0$ to make it appear that the water reaches the top of tank:</p>

<p>$$ W= 62.4 \int_{-2} ^0 y^2 \times  \pi x^2 dy $$</p>

<p>Since the equation of the circle (which is the cross-section of the hemisphere) is $x^2 + y^2 = 6^2$ and rearranging it to get $x^2 = 6^2 - y^2$: </p>

<p>$$ W= 62.4 \int_{-2} ^0 y^2 \times  \pi (6^2 - y^2) dy $$
Giving the answer $W = 17 \space 564. 77$ lb-ft. </p>

<p>Converting the units lb-ft into ton-ft:</p>

<p>$$17 \space 564.77 \space lb-ft \times \frac{1 \space kg}{0.4536 \space lbs} \times \frac{1 \space ton}{1 \space 000 \space kg} = 38.7 \space ton-ft $$</p>

<p>But my book said that the work done in pumping the water to the top of the tank is 25.1 ton - ft. How do you get the value of 25.1 ton - ft?</p>

$$
M = C_M^{-1} + G^T C_D^{-1} G.
$$
Here, $C_M$ is a covariance matrix (which is positive semi-definite and symmetric, sometimes positive definite)  of dimensions $n \times n$, which is not necessarily diagonal. The matrix $C_D$, of dimensions $m \times m$, is also a covariance matrix which in my application is always diagonal, but could be extended to any arbitrary covariance matrix (so always positive semi-definite, symmetric). </p>

<p>G is an arbitrary matrix of dimensions $m \times n$. It does not necessarily have full rank. I think this already excludes positive definiteness of the second term, since $x^T G^T G x = (G x)^T(G x) &gt; 0$ only if G is full rank.</p>

<p>Can we extend this to $G^T C_D^{-1} G$ to prove that M is positive semi-definite symmetric? I'd suggest to use the property $x^T A x \geq 0$;</p>

<p>$$
\begin{eqnarray} 
x^T G^T C_D^{-1} G x &amp;=&amp; (G x)^T C_D^{-1} (G x)     \nonumber \\
&amp; \overset{?}{\geq} &amp; 0
\end{eqnarray} 
$$</p>

<p>I guess this boils down to proving that the inverse of $C_D$ (and $C_M$) is positive semi-definite, because afterwards we can again use the same definition on $(G x)^T C_D^{-1} (G x) $. And the sum of PSD matrices is also PSD (that proof is rather easy, see <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/544139/sum-of-positive-definite-matrices-still-positive-definite"">here</a>).</p>

<p>And then a small follow up; if the second term is PSD, but the first term is PD, the resulting matrix M is also PD right?</p>

<p>For a little context, from the first equation matrix $M$ is used as the mass matrix in a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler, and I need to Cholesky decompose it to propose momentum samples. Cholesky decomposition can (I think) only be done on a positive definite matrix. If a matrix is positive semi-definite, it is still possible to Cholesky decompose it if the diagonal entries of $L$ are allowed to be zero, but I don't know if my algorithm breaks down in this case. </p>

<p>Thus $P(x\ge y)  = 1 - 7/8 = 1/8$. Is this right?</p>

Here we've just proved that $S_T$ is integrable.The last text line of the proof, which is missing from the picture, states that «the same computation without the absolute values yields the remaining part of the claim», i.e., the same computation withou abs values yields the equality $E(S_T)=E(T)E(X_1)$.

"2387792","2392735","Natural class of functions whose $\mathcal O$-sets are linearly ordered","<p>In doing complexity analysis of algorithms, we often restrict to their asymptotic complexity. A function $g: \mathbb N \to \mathbb R_+$ is asymptotically bounded by $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb R_+$ if there are constants $c \in \mathbb R_+, N \in \mathbb N$ such that for each $n \geq N$,
$$
g(n) \leq c\cdot f(n).
$$
The set of all such $g$ is referred to as $\mathcal O(f)$. By letting $g \preceq f$ if $\mathcal O(g) \subseteq \mathcal O(f)$, we obtain a preordering on the set of functions $\mathbb N \to \mathbb R_+$. </p>

<p>Examples of functions that typically come up as complexities of algorithms are:
$$\tag{*}
\log(\log(n)), \log(n),\log(n)^2, \sqrt{n}, n, n\log(n),n\sqrt{n},n^3, 2^n, 3^n, 2^{2^n}.
$$
Interestingly, these functions are all linearly ordered by $\preceq$. Note that it is not hard to find functions which are <em>not</em> linearly ordered by $\preceq$, like $|\sin(n)|$ and $|\cos(n)|$, and with some fiddling it would not be too hard to make examples of strictly increasing (or even convex) functions which are not linearly ordered by $\preceq$. However, these examples all seem artificial, and in particular I would be surprised if they ever came up as complexities of algorithms.</p>

<p>Can we explicitly give a nice class of functions that includes at least all the functions listed in (*), and for which $\preceq$ is a linear ordering? Is this class also closed under some operations, like multiplication, exponentiation by a constant, or taking logarithms? And, perhaps, could we even justify why any algorithm is likely to have a complexity in this class?</p>

b=\left(0,\frac{y}{b},0\right)\\
a=\left(\frac{x}{a},0,0\right)\\
c=\left(0,0,\frac{z}{c}\right)

Which would produce vectors:

AB=\left\langle -\frac{x}{a},\frac{y}{b},0\right\rangle\\
AC=\left\langle -\frac{x}{a},0,\frac{z}{c}\right\rangle

Let $X_g$ and $Z$ be uncorrelated but not necessarily be independent. Furthermore, let $$ \tag{1} Y = X_G + Z.$$
I'm interested in the mutual information $$ \tag{2} I(X_G;Y) = h(Y) - h(Y \vert X_G) = h(Y) - h( Z ) .$$</p>

<p>According to e.g. [1, Theorem 2], the differential entropy $h(Z)$ is upper bounded by the entropy of a complex Gaussian random vector $Z_G \sim \mathcal{CN}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{\Sigma}_Z)$ with the same covariance $$ \tag{3} h(Z) \leq h(Z_G) = \log \det \left( \pi e \mathbf{\Sigma}_Z \right), $$ because the complex Gaussian distribution has the largest entropy. Using this I obtain the following lower bound on (2) $$ \tag{4} I(X_G;Y_G) = h(Y_G) - h(Z_G) \leq h(Y) - h(Z) = I(X_G;Y), $$ where $Y_G$ indicates that $Y$ is complex normal distributed in this case.</p>

<p>In contrast, the authors of [2, Lemma II.2] obtain the same lower bound (4), however, they require that $Z$ and $Z_G$ are both independent of $X_G$ (which they are not in my case). They use a different derivation which mainly relies on Jensen's inequality. However, I do not see where they make use of $Z$ and $Z_G$ being independent of $X_G$ in their derivation.</p>

<p>Also in [3, Theorem 1] the authors discuss a similar problem where $Z$ and $X_G$ are uncorrelated but not independent. However, the main step of their solution is also the Gaussian entropy upper bound (3). Furthermore, they also obtain the worst case covariance matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}_Z^*$ (which I am not interested in).</p>

<p>In summary, I have the following questions</p>

<ol>
<li>Are the lower bounds (3) and (4) valid?</li>
<li>Why does [2, Lemma II.2] require $Z$ and $Z_G$ both to be independent of $X_G$, which is also the reason for the ""new"" theorem in [3]?</li>

<p><strong>My claim is</strong>: Suppose $V$ is a finite dimensional <strong>complex</strong> vector space and $T:V \to V$ is a linear map. Then $T$ has  a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_matrix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">diagonal</a> with respect to some basis of $V.$</p>

<p><strong>Here is my proof</strong>: Assume dim $V=n.$  Since $V$ is complex vector space, $T$ has an eigenvalue, say $\lambda_1$ (This is known fact). There for there is nonzero vector $v_1\in V$
such that $$Tv_1= \lambda_1 v_1$$.</p>

<p>Put $U_1=\text{span} (v_1).$ Note that $U_1$ is a subspace of $V.$ Then there is subspace $W\subset V$ such that 
$$V= U_1\oplus W$$
and dim $W=n-1.$</p>

<p>Again, we may say that $T$ is linear map on a complex vector space $W,$ and therefore it has a eigenvalue, say $\lambda_2$, and the corresponding eigenvector $0\neq v_2\in W$ and $Tv_2= \lambda_2 v_2.$ </p>

<p>We may continue this process, and I think, we get $v_1, v_2,..., v_n$ linearly independent eigenvector of $T$. And therefore the matrix of $T$ with respec to this basis is diagonal.</p>

Let $C$ and $D$ two objects of $\mathscr{C}$ such as there's an injection $j \ : C\ \to D$ and a morphism from $C \to Coker \Phi$. As $Coker \Phi $ is the data of an object $Coker \Phi$ of $\mathscr{C}$ and a morphism $\chi_{Coker\phi} : B \to Coker \Phi$ and as $B$ is injective, I am trying to build an injective arrow $j$ from $Coker \Phi \to B$ such as $\chi_{Coker \phi}\circ j =Id_{Coker \Phi}$.

<p>Using the vertical strip $dx$ and remembering that the centroid $C(\bar x, \bar y)$ can be found by the formula:</p>

<p>$$A \bar x = \int x_c \space dA$$ and $$A \bar y = \int y_c \space dA$$</p>

<p>To get area $A$:</p>

<p>$$A = \int_{-1} ^2 (y_{upper} - y_{lower}) dx$$
Then: $$A = \int_{-1} ^2 ((2x-x^2) - (x^2 - 4)) dx = 9$$</p>

<p>To get $x_c:$
$$x_c = x$$</p>

<p>To get $dA:$
$$dA = y \space dx$$
$$dA = (y_{upper} - y_{lower}) \space dx$$
$$dA = ((2x-x^2) - (x^2 - 4)) \space dx$$
$$dA = (-2x^2+2x + 4) \space dx$$</p>

<p>To get $ y_c:$
$$y_c  = I \space don't \space know$$</p>

<p>We got all we need to find, and substituting it to the formula shown below:
$$A \bar x = \int x_c \space dA$$
$$9 \bar x = \int_{-1} ^2 x \space ((2x-x^2) - (x^2 - 4)) \space dx$$
$$9 \bar x = \int_{-1} ^2 x \space (-2x^2+2x + 4) \space dx$$
$$x_c = \frac{1}{2}$$</p>

<p>Looking now for the $y_c:$</p>

<p>$$A \bar y = \int y_c \space dA$$</p>

"2388127","2388180","Why is the obelus sign (÷) exclusively used in elementary school education","<p>I am from Taiwan (ROC). When I was in elementary school, as I remember, instructors and textbooks notated division (of real numbers, for sure) as ""÷"", which (as I just read Wikipedia) I know is called the <em>obelus</em>.
But at that time I read many advanced math book myself, and learned that people use ""/"", the slash, to notate division (and fraction, if you see this way).</p>

<p>Strangely, when I was in the first year of middle school (equivalent to the 7th grade in the US), the math textbook announced that, from now on, the obelus is to be discouraged and deprecated, and we shall always use fraction, and when the space does not allow, use a slash.</p>

<p>Except elementary school textbooks (and exercise books), I have never seen the obelus.
I don't claim I read widely about math, but I have basic familiarity with like analysis, algebra, geometry. Still, I have nowhere seen the obelus.
Neither does any scientific publication use it, as far as I recall.
I may have had a calculator that has an obelus on it, but I can't find it now.</p>

<p><strong>Why is the obelus taught in the elementary school, though it virtually never occurs elsewhere?</strong> I see no advantage in teaching kids one very rare (if ever used) notation -- obelus -- in the beginning, and abandon it, and then enforce the use of another notation -- slash. It is also very mysterious why obelus stands for division, which Wikipedia doesn't say. On the contrary, a slash reminds me it is a fraction ""lying down"" due to limited space, and is completely intuitive.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia: (lest it be edited away)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although previously used for subtraction, the obelus was first used as a symbol for division in 1659 in the algebra book Teutsche Algebra by Johann Rahn. Some think that John Pell, who edited the book, may have been responsible for this use of the symbol. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My guess is that the obelus was first used to stand for division. 
No wonder 17th century people still used strange notation borrowed from Greek text criticism (see above). The convention of algebra equations was still being formed, and the <em>Principia Mathematica</em>'s equations were mainly written verbally!</p>

<p>Afterwards, the slash was probably gradually widely used, but elementary school textbooks, somehow, did not follow the trend.
The appearance of the obelus in elementary school textbooks, then, is probably a relic of old notation.
Do you agree my guess? Is there any source that confirm this, or claim otherwise?</p>

"2388179","2393014","Prove convexity when restricted to a line","<p>One of several ways to check convexity is when the function is restricted to a line (p.67-68, Boyd's and Vandenberghe's book on Convex Optimization): A function $f$ is convex if and only if for all $x\in\text{dom}f$ and all $v$, the function $g(t)=f(x+tv)$ is convex (on its domain, $\left\{t\mid x+tv\in\text{dom}f\right\}$).</p>

<p>I'd like to prove this rather simple thing, but since I'm a novice when it comes to proofs, I'd appreciate your take on it. </p>

<p>One straightforward way is to check whether the second derivative is positive semidefinite, but this is only a sufficient condition and also requires the function to be twice differentiable:
$$g(t)=f(x+tv) \\ g'(t)=f'(x+tv)v \\ g''(t)=f''(x+tv)v^2$$
which is positive semidefinite since $f$ is convex (i.e., $f''\geq 0$).</p>

<p>Another and probably the preferred way:</p>

<p>($\Rightarrow$): If $f(x)$ is convex, then $f(y)$ is also convex for any $y=x+tv$ that belongs to the same domain as $x$.</p>

<p>($\Leftarrow$): Only if $f(x+tv)$ is convex, is $f(x)$ convex. This follows from the fact that if $f(x+tv)$ is convex for $x+tv$ for any $t$, then it is also convex for $t=0$, in which case the result follows.</p>

"2388193","2391360","Hilbert-Schmidt norm and Trace Class norm - comparison","<p>Given a bounded operator on a Hilbert space $A \in \mathcal{B}(H)$, I am familiar with the fact that the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of an operator is lesser or equal to the trace class norm, i.e. $\|A\|_{\mathcal{HS}} \leq \|A\|_{\mathcal{TC}}$.</p>

<p>While working with weighted $\ell_2$ spaces, I was faced with an apparent contradiction of this fact. Let me be clear : I have total confidence in the inequality $\|A\|_{\mathcal{HS}} \leq \|A\|_{\mathcal{TC}}$. I believe instead that I've made a logical or computational mistake somewhere. However, I'm unable to spot it.</p>

<p>Consider a weight function $w: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow (0,\infty)$ and let
$H$ be the Hilbert space $\ell_2(\mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z})$ endowed with the weighted euclidean norm
$$ \|f\|_w :=~ \sqrt{\sum\limits_{k =1}^m w(k)^2 |f(k)|^2}.$$</p>

<p>Let's denote by $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_w$ the associated inner product.</p>

<p>If $\{e_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is the standard orthonormal basis of $\ell_2(\mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z})$, then $\{u_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is an orthonormal basis of $H$ where $u_n := \frac{e_n}{\|e_n\|_w} =\frac{e_n}{w(n)}$.</p>

<p>Now consider $A \in \mathcal{B}(H)$ a bounded operator on $H$. </p>

<ul>
<li>The Hilbert-Schmidt norm of $A$ is defined by $\sqrt{\sum\limits_{k=1}^m \big\|A(u_k)\big\|_w^2}$.</li>
<li>The Trace Class norm of $A$ is defined by $\sum\limits_{k=1}^m \Big\langle (A^*A)^{\frac{1}{2}}(u_k),u_k\Big\rangle_w$, where $A^*$ is the adjoint operator of $A$ and $(A^*A)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ is a square root of the positive operator $A^*A$. </li>
</ul>

<p>Now consider the operator $A:= \langle \cdot, e_i\rangle_w e_j$ for some $1 \leq i, j \leq m$.</p>

<p>I've computed that $\|A\|_{\mathcal{TC}} = w(i)^2$ whereas $\|A\|_{\mathcal{HS}} = w(i)w(j)$ but this is impossible because for $i \neq j$ we could find values of $w(i)$ and $w(j)$ for which $\|A\|_{\mathcal{HS}} &gt; \|A\|_{\mathcal{TC}}$.</p>

<p>Hence there most be something wrong with  my computations of the norms of the operator $A:= \langle \cdot, e_i\rangle_w e_j$. The thing is : when I look at my computations, I can't identity when I have sinned.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Trace Class norm :</strong> Observe first that $A$ can be identified with the $m$ by $m$ matrix whose entries are all zero except for the $(j,i)$-th which is $w(i)^2$. Hence $A^*A$ can be identified with the $m$ by $m$ matrix whose entries are all zero except for the $(i,i)$-th which is $w(i)^4$. Hence $(A^*A)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ can be identified with the $m$ by $m$ matrix whose entries are all zero except for the $(i,i)$-th which is $w(i)^2$. Therefore $$(A^*A)^{\frac{1}{2}}(u_k) = \begin{cases}w(i)e_i~~~ \text{if $k = i$}\\ 0~~~~~~~ \text{otherwise}
 \end{cases}$$
  Hence $$\|A\|_{\mathcal{TC}} = \sum\limits_{k=1}^m \Big\langle (T^*T)^{\frac{1}{2}} u_k, u_k \Big\rangle_w = \Big\langle (T^*T)^{\frac{1}{2}} u_i, u_i \Big\rangle_w = \big\langle w(i) e_i, u_i \big\rangle_w = \|e_i\|_w^2 = w(i)^2.$$</p>
  
  <p><strong>Hilbert-Schmidt norm :</strong> $$\Big\|\langle \cdot, e_i\rangle_w e_j\Big\|_{\mathcal{HS}} = \left(\sum\limits_{k=1}^m \big\|\langle u_k, e_i\rangle_w

 w(j)^2\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}} = w(i)w(j)$$ since $\langle u_k,
 e_i\rangle_w = \left\langle \frac{e_k}{w(k)}, e_i\right\rangle =

<p>$$ m + 0 = m$$
$$ m + (n + 1) = (m + n) + 1$$</p>

<p>Now, using this definition, I showed the usual properties of natural number addition; so that $m + 0 = 0 + m = m$, $m + n = n + m$, $m + (n + l) = (m + n) + l$. In particular, I don't know about inverses or subtraction because I did not introduce $Z$ yet. </p>

<p>$$ m \cdot 0 = 0$$
$$ m \cdot (n + 1) = m \cdot n + m$$  </p>

<p>I showed the associativity, that $n \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot n = 0$ and also $m \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot m = m$. Right now, I am trying to prove commutativity by induction.</p>

<p><em>Proof Attempt:</em> By induction on n;</p>

<p>Base Case: $m \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot m $ is already shown.</p>

<p>Inductive Case: Suppose $m \cdot n = n \cdot m$</p>

$$= n \cdot m + m$$ [by inductive hypothesis]
$$= n \cdot m + n - n + m + 1 - 1$$</p>

<p>I think I can complete things from here but I don't want to use subtraction in my proofs because I haven't defined such a notion yet. Can the commutative property be proven only by the things I showed above? I think it should be possible because natural number multiplication has this property. On the other hand, I know subtraction can be defined without defining full integers. Still, I am looking for a proof that uses only above properties. </p>

Fortunately, I have a nonlinear equation relating $g(x)$ that I can solve (say, $f(g(x))=0$), looking the same way with multiple integrals over $g(x)$. The problem is, I don't know how to solve it yet, depending on what operations I'm allowed to do on the expression. $x$ itself is not really an independent variable, more of a function depending in a highly non-linear way on input parameters (it's a position). It acts more as a label. In fact, we don't really see $h(x,g(x))$ or $g(x)$ as functions of $x$, but rather $h(g)$ as a function of $g$ (and other variables) and $g$ as an independent variable, a physical quantity.

Say I want to solve $f(g(x))$ with a Newton-Raphson method, which means I need $f^{\prime}(g)=\frac{df(g(x))}{dg(x)}$: since $g(x)$ is considered as a variable, can I do the $g(x)$ derivative without having recourse to the chain rule? To me it would seem like cheating. But in a much simpler analogue case I constructed the function $f(g(x))=0$ for solving with Newton-Raphson and did the trick for $f^{\prime}(g)$:
$$ \frac{d}{dg(x)}\int_{x-a}^{x}A(x^{\prime})g(x^{\prime})dx^{\prime} = \int_{x-a}^{x}A(x^{\prime})\frac{dg(x^{\prime})}{dg(x)}dx^{\prime} = \int_{x-a}^{x}A(x^{\prime})dx^{\prime} $$
the integral representing any member of $f(g)$. Considering that for this case $f(g)$ can be written as $f(g(x))=p(g(x))+g(x)=0$, I also rewrote $f(g(x))$ as
$$ g(x)=-p(g(x)) $$
and solved as regular relaxation problem. In both cases I got the exact same answer.</p>

<p>In another case, there's a complete working (ie. converging) code that needs the quantity:
$$ \frac{dh(x,g(x))}{dg(x)} $$
where
$$ h(x,g(x))=a(x)g(x) $$
for simplicity. In that case, the former was given by
$$ \frac{dh(x,g(x))}{dg(x)}=a(x) $$</p>

<p>Since it seems to be working in last two examples, why can we do this? (if we really can do it) Is there a rigorous answer for this, or it's some kind of trick in numerical problems? Or is this one of these gray areas a physicist would go in? </p>

"2388205","2388227","Distances between $3$ random points on $[0,1]$","<p>Suppose $3$ points are drawn uniformly at random from $[0,1]$. Call them $x_1,x_2,x_3$ with $x_1\leq x_2\leq x_3$. I am interested in the distances between them. </p>

<p>Fix $0&lt;a&lt;b&lt;1$. I want to compute the probability $P$ that 
$$x_2-x_1 &lt; a, \ \ \ \ x_3 -x_2 &lt; a,\ \ \ \  x_3-x_1 &gt; b$$
In other words, the two pairs of adjacent points are $a$-close to each other, but the two outside points are $b$-far apart. Clearly this can't happen unless $b&lt;2a$. </p>

<p>Since we have a uniform distribution, we can integrate the constant density $\equiv 1$ over the appropriate region in $[0,1]^3$. Now, $x_2$ must be within $a$ of $x_1$, and $x_3$ has to be at least $b$ greater than $x_1$ but not more than $a$ above $x_2$. This gives the following:</p>

<p>$$P = \int_0^{1-2a}\int_{x_1}^{x_1+a}\int_{x_1+b}^{x_2+a}\ dx_3\ dx_2\ dx_1$$</p>

<p>The problem: $x_{1}$ doesn't have to be less than $1-2a$; it should be able to be as large as $1-b$ (well technically, arbitrarily close to it but still less than). For instance, if $a=.2, b=.3$ then an acceptable set of points would be $.69,.85,1$. Clearly there are $2$ cases to consider, but I'm having a hard time explicitly differentiating the cases in order to write down two integrals. It seems the second case should look like</p>

<p>$$\int_{1-2a}^{1-b}\int_{x_1}^{x_1+a}\int_{x_1+b}^1\ dx_3\ dx_2\ dx_1$$</p>

<p>However I don't feel that this is correct. Specifically, it doesn't look like the above guarantees that $x_3-x_2&lt;a$. Are these the only two cases to consider? What are the appropriate bounds in the second integral? Is there a better way to approach this problem?</p>

The goal is to find $x$ such that:
$$f(x)=\frac{4n}{n+1}$$</p>

<p>This looks and definitely is really simple, and yet I can't figure out where's my mistake. </p>

<p>First I've done 
$$\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{(k\log_x 2 )(k+1)\log_x 2}=\frac{4n}{n+1} $$
Then:
$$\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k(k+1)\log^2_x 2 }=\frac{4n}{n+1} $$
I multiplied by the logarithm:
$$\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k(k+1)}=\frac{4n}{n+1}\log^2_x 2  $$ 
So: 
$$\ 1-\frac{1}{n+1}=\frac{4n}{n+1}\log^2_x 2 $$ 
And this results in $x=4$ (when it is supposed to be $\frac{1}{4}$).</p>

<p>When approaching it again(found my mistake in this approach), I just separated each term of the sum like $$\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{\log_x 2^k}-\frac{1}{\log_x (2^k\cdot 2)}$$ 
and it resulted in 
$$\ \frac{1}{\log_x 2}- \frac{1}{\log_x (2^n\cdot2)}=\frac{4n}{n+1} $$ 
Which is the same as:
$$\ \frac{1}{\log_x 2}- \frac{1}{(n+1)\log_x 2}=\frac{4n}{n+1} $$ 
And then I got: 
$$\ 1- \frac{1}{n+1}=\frac{4n}{n+1}\log_x 2 $$
That really got confused due to the difference from the one above it. And this gives $x=16$.</p>

<p>Could you please tell me where am I mistaking and why aren't those $2$ above the same? Thank you</p>

<p>Let $P(t) = a_nt^n + . . . + a_1t + a_0$ be such a Polynomial. Then $a_0 = P(0) = 0$. For any real nonzero $c, a_nc^{n - 1} + . . . + a_1 = P(c)/c = 0$. 
(We do not know that the left side vanishes at $c = 0$ without further development; in order to avoid this issue, we need to make a more elaborate argument at this point.) Suppose, if possible, $a_1 \neq 0$, choose $c$ such that $0 &lt; c &lt; 1$ and </p>

<p>Solution:</p>

<p>Since $f$ is meromorphic, and $|f(z)| &lt; \infty$ for $|z| &gt; R$, $f$ must have only finitely many poles $a_1, \dots, a_m$ (with multiplicity) in the disk $|z| \leq R$. Let $g(z) = (z-a_1)\dots(z-a_m)f(z)$, then $g(z)$ is entire and $|g(z)| \leq C'|z|^{m+n}$ for $|z|$ large enough, and therefore $g(z)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $m+n$, using Cauchy's estimate $|f^N(0)| \leq C'r^{m+n}N!r^{-N} \rightarrow 0$ as $r\rightarrow \infty$ if $N&gt;m+n$. Thus, $f(z) = g(z)/((z-a_1)\dots (z-a_n))$ must be a rational function.</p>

"2388457","2388677","Asymptotic Growth of Generalised Catalan Numbers","<p>I'm trying to understand the asymptotic behaviour of a family of integer sequences related to the Catalan numbers $\left( c_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$.  The OEIS suggests that these are known as generalised Catalan numbers; I'm not sure if this term is used more widely.  I think I've been able to figure a lot of this out by myself, but I'd appreciate suggestions for any suitable reference I could look up to better understand things.</p>

<p>Recall that the Catalan numbers have generating function $F(z)$ where $$F(z) = \frac{1-\sqrt{1-4z}}{2z} .$$ Now for any integer $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ let the 'generalised` Catalan numbers of type $k$ be the integer sequence $(c^{[k]}_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with generating function $F_k(z)$ satisfying $$F_k(z) = \frac{1}{1-kzF(z)}.$$</p>

<p>For example, $(c^{[1]}_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ are just the (ordinary) Catalan numbers and $(c^{[2]}_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ are the central binomial coefficients.  In these two cases we have exact formulas:</p>

<p>$$ c^{[1]}_n = \frac{1}{n+1} {2n \choose n}$$ </p>

<p>and</p>

<p>$$ c^{[2]}_n = {2n \choose n} .$$</p>

<p>We can use these, together with <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StirlingsApproximation.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stirling's approximation</a>, to show that</p>

<p>$$ c^{[1]}_n \sim \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{\pi n^3}} $$</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>$$ c^{[2]}_n \sim \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{\pi n}}.$$</p>

<p>For other $k$ I'm not aware of any similar formulas.  The case $k=0$ is trivial as $c^{[0]}_n = 0$ for all $n &gt; 0$.  And I assume the remaining cases require singularity analysis, which is something I'm not really familiar with. </p>

<p>I've been told -- though I don't think I've ever seen a proof -- that when an integer sequence $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ has a generating function $P(z)$ the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence depends on the smallest non-zero singularity $z_0$ of $P(z)$.  In particular, I understand that in this case $a_n \sim \theta(n) |z_0|^{-n}$ for $\theta$ some subexponential function.</p>

<p>In the case of $F_k(z)$ as long as $k \neq 0$ there are two singularities: a pole at $z=\frac{k-1}{k^2}$ and a branch point at $z=\frac{1}{4}$.  Since $$0 &lt; \left|\frac{k-1}{k^2}\right| &lt; \frac{1}{4} $$ for all integers $k$ other than those in $$I := \left\{ -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 \right\}$$ this means that for $k \notin I$ we should have $$c^{[k]}_n \sim \theta_k(n) \left( \frac{k^2}{k-1} \right)^n . $$</p>

<p>I'm not sure how in general one would go about finding $\theta_k$.  In fact, by trial and error I've persuaded myself that -- again, for $k \notin I$ -- we have $$ c^{[k]}_n \sim \frac{k-2}{k-1} \left( \frac{k^2}{k-1} \right)^n $$ but again I'm not sure how to prove this to be true.</p>

<p>The remaining cases should, I assume, be of the form $c^{[k]}_n \sim \theta_k(n) 4^n$.  This is true for $k=1$ and $k=2$ (shown above).  And it's apparently true for the case $k=-1$, as <a href=""http://oeis.org/A126983"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fung Lam</a> (on the OEIS) gives the estimate $$c^{[-1]}_n \sim - \frac{4^n}{9 \sqrt{\pi n^3}}.$$</p>

<p>I've not been able to even guess what the subexponential term should be for the remaining three cases. </p>

<p>In summary then, I really have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are the particular estimates for the asymptotic growth of $c^{[k]}_n$ that I suggest above correct?  Is anything known about the cases $k \in \{-4,-3,-2\}$?</li>
<li>In general, how can I derive expressions for the asymptotic behaviour of an integer sequence if I know its generating function?  (I suspect what I'm really looking for here is the name of a useful textbook...)</li>

"2388470","2388486","Spot the mistakes? Proof of the Twin Prime conjecture and Goldbach's theorem","<p><strong>The Twin Prime Conjecture</strong></p>

<p>For any prime number $p_x$ larger than 3, there exists a number $n$ that is less than $p_x^2 -2$ and does not have a remainder of $\pm 1$ when divided by any prime number less than or equal to $p_x$.</p>

<p><strong>Why is this the same as the Twin Prime Conjecture?</strong></p>

<p>If $n$ exists as above, then $n \pm 1$ are prime numbers because; they are not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to $p_x$ and they are less than $p_{x+1}^2$ which is the smallest composite number whose prime factors are all greater than $p_x$. As there are infinitely many prime numbers, it follows that there are infinitely twin prime numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Direct Proof</strong> </p>

<p>If $n$ does exist as above. It follows that $n \equiv 0\mod 2$ and $n \equiv 0 \mod 3$ as all other values contradict the OP statement. It also follows that for any other prime number $p_i$, there are only $p_i - 2$ possible remainders that $n$ can have when divided by $p_i$, because the remainders ""$\pm 1$"" also contradict the OP statement.</p>

<p>The Chinese Remainder Theorem ensures the existence of a number $m$ that satisfies the system of conditions, $m \equiv a_i\mod p_i$, where $1 \leq i \leq x$ and $a_i$ are specified remainders.</p>

<p>The Chinese Remainder Theorem also gives a way of calculating the value of $m$.
By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, if $n$ exists as above, then </p>

<p>$n \equiv \Sigma_{i=3}^x (a_i)(\frac{b_iP_x\#}{p_i}) \mod P_x\#$ where $P_x\# := \Pi_{i=1}^x p_i $ and $b_i$ is given by solving $\frac{b_iP_x\#}{p_i} \equiv 1 \mod p_i$.</p>

<p>Let $c_i = \frac{b_iP_x\#}{p_i}$, then $n \equiv \Sigma_{i=3}^x (a_i)(c_i) \mod P_x\#$</p>

<p>If $c_i \equiv 1 \mod p_i$ then $c_i \mod P_x\#$ can take any one of $\frac{P_x\#}{p_i}$, depending on which value of $b_i$ is chosen. </p>

<p>Choose $b_i$ such that  $c_i \equiv 1 \mod P_x\#$</p>

<p>It follows that $n \equiv \Sigma_{i=3}^x (a_i) \mod P_x\#$.</p>

<p>Choose  $a_i = 2$, then $n &lt; 2x &lt;p_x^2 $</p>

<p>Q.E.D.</p>

<p><strong>Goldbach's Conjecture</strong></p>

<p>For any number $n$ such that $p_x^2 &lt; 2n &lt; p_{x+1}^2$ and $p_{x+1}^2 &lt; P_x\#$, there exists another number $e &lt; n - p_x$ such that $n \pm e$ are not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to $p_x$.</p>

<p><strong>Direct Proof</strong></p>

<p>For any prime number $p_i$ less than or equal to $p_x$, there are only certain remainders that $e$ can have when divided by $p_i$ to ensure that $n \pm e$ is not divisible by $p_i$. </p>

<p>If $e$ exists, it follows from the reasoning in the last proof that $e \equiv \Sigma_{i=1}^x (a_i) \mod P_x\#$. </p>

The type of functional equation that I am looking for has only one variable (namely $x$) and often has a very strange answer using identities of various types of functions. For example, one of the easier equations is
$$\alpha(x)+\alpha(2x)=1$$
I'm looking for non-boring (and thus non-constant) solutions, and so one solution to this equation is
$$\alpha(x)=\sin^2(2\pi\log_2 x)$$
two examples of more complicated problems are
$$\beta(x)+\beta\bigg(\frac{x-1}{x+1}\bigg)=\sin x$$

<p><em>Proof</em>: Let $\{ f_n \}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a dense subset of the unit ball $\mathcal{B}$ in $X^{\ast}$. For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, pick $x_n \in X$ such that $f_n(x_n) &gt; \frac{1}{2}$. Let $Y = \overline{\text{span}\{x_n\}}$ and observe that $Y$ is separable, since finite rational combinations of $\{ x_n \}$ are dense in $Y$. It is now sufficient to show that $X=Y$. We proceed by contradiction. Suppose that $X \neq Y$. Then there is an $f \in X^{\ast}$, with $\| f \| =1$ such that $f(x) =0$ for all $x \in Y$. Now choose $n$ such that $\| f_n - f \| &lt; \frac{1}{4}$. Then \begin{eqnarray*}
\left| f(x_n) \right| &amp; = &amp; \left| f_n(x_n) - f_n(x_n) + f(x_n) \right| \\

"2388580","2388753","Trivial connections on trivial bundles","<p>In Cliff Taubes' book ""Differential geometry"", he explains how to define the trivial connection on the product principal bundle $U \times G,$ where $G$ is a Lie group.  Namely, the trivial connection $A_0$ is a Lie(G)-valued 1-form which is defined at the point $(p, g) \in U \times G$ by $g^{-1}dg.$  </p>

<p>I am confused about what $dg$ is supposed to mean.  </p>

<p>Possible interpretation: we could view $g$ as the identity function on the underlying Lie group.  Then $dg$ is just the differential, which takes a tangent vector $X \in T_gG$ to itself.</p>

<p>We view $g^{-1}$ as the differential of the group multiplication map $h \mapsto g^{-1}\cdot h.$  Then $g^{-1} dg$ maps $T_gG \to T_eG$ and hence is indeed a Lie algebra value 1-form. </p>

<p>However, this interpretation seems strange because it treats both $dg$ and $g^{-1}$ as differentials, even though the $d$ is missing from the second symbol.</p>

"2388647","2388655","Proof that $L^{p}$ is complete in Folland's Real Analysis","<p>The following is from Folland's Real Analysis, Theorem 6.6. The theorem states: </p>

<p>$\underline{\text{Theorem } 6.6:}$ For $1 \leq p &lt; \infty$, $L^{p}$ is a Banach space. </p>

<p>The proof makes use of Theorem 5.1 which is as follows:</p>

<p>$\underline{\text{Theorem } 5.1:}$ A normed vector space $X$ is complete iff every absolutely convergent series in $X$ converges. </p>

<p>$\underline{\text{The Proof of Theorem 6.6}:}$</p>

<p>We use Theorem 5.1.  Suppose $\left \{ f_{k} \right \} \subset L^{p}$ and $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} ||f_{k}||_{p} = B &lt; \infty$. Let $\displaystyle G_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} |f_{k}|$ and $\displaystyle G = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |f_{k}|$. Then </p>

<p>\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
||G_{n}||_{p} =  \big( \int \big| \sum_{k=1}^{n} |f_{k}|  \big|^{p} \big)^{1/p} \\
= \big( \int (|f_{1}| + \dots + |f_{n}|)^{p} \big)^{1/p} \\
\leq \big( \int |f_{1}|^{p} + \dots + \int |f_{n}|^{p} \big)^{1/p} \\
\leq \big( \int |f_{1}|^{p} \big)^{1/p} + \dots + \big( \int |f_{n}|^{p} \big)^{1/p} \\
= \sum_{k=1}^{n} ||f_{k}||_{p} \\
\leq B
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}</p>

<p>for all $n$. Therefore, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem (since $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{n} |f_{k}| \leq \sum_{k=1}^{n+1}|f_{k}|)$</p>

<p>\begin{equation*}
\int G^{p} = \lim \int G_{n}^{p} \leq B^{p}
\end{equation*}</p>

<p>Thus, $G \in L^{p}$, and in particular, $G(x) &lt; \infty$ a.e., implying that the series $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} f_{k}$ converges a.e. Denoting its sum by $F$, we have $|F| \leq G$ and hence $F \in L^{p}$. Moreover, </p>

<p>\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
|F - \sum_{k=1}^{n} f_{k}|^{p} \leq (2G)^{p} \in L^{1}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}</p>

<p>Thus, by the Dominated Convergence Theorem, </p>

<p>\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} ||F - \sum_{k=1}^{n} f_{k}||_{p}^{p} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int \big| F - \sum_{k=1}^{n} f_{k} \big|^{p}  = \int \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \big| F - \sum_{k=1}^{n} f_{k} \big|^{p} = 0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}</p>

<p>Thus ,the series $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} f_{k}$ converges in the $L^{p}$ norm. This completes the proof. </p>

<p>My question is why does this show that every absolutely convergent series in $X$ converges (thus allowing us to apply Theorem 5.1 thereby completing the proof)? Doesn't $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} ||F - \sum_{k=1}^{n} f_{k}||_{p}^{p} = 0$ in fact show that the series merely converges in $L^{p}$? Not converge absolutely in $L^{p}$? </p>

<p>Countably infinite is defined as having a one-to-one mapping with the natural numbers. The immediate idea that comes to me is that the naturals are themselves rationals, so the identity mapping causes problems for me. We map each natural number to itself and viola, we've exhausted all counting numbers just mapping to themselves; nothing left for the likes of $\frac{1}{2}$. I try to counter this by using the ""endless hotel"" idea: since there's an infinite number of naturals, just scoot one space over and fit in another rational, then repeat. This seems fishy. For one, maybe it's wrong outright, but it also raises the question of why we can't do the same thing when working with the irrationals. </p>

<p>The other thought that comes to me is the mapping of some natural ""$n$"" to a rational $\frac{1}{10^n}$. This should be a one-to-one mapping that'll exhaust all naturals, yet we don't even get past one on the number line. </p>

<p>The motivation for this question is that I am working on an mobile application that renders a map onto the screen.  The user's current location is marked with a blue dot.  I want the blue dot to be placed near the bottom-left corner of the screen.  But the dot itself cannot be moved: I must instead specify the latitude/longitude to be used as the center of the map and I need to calculate the map center to use in order to locate the blue dot at the desired location.  </p>

<p>When the phone is rotated then the map needs to rotate about the blue dot (not about the center of the map).  The math to figure this out is easy if the ""camera"" is looking at the map head-on (tilt=0) as I just need to trace the circumference of the circle centered at the center of the map that goes through the desired (x,y) position of the blue dot; however, if the map is tilted then I need to instead trace the circumference of the ellipse passing through the blue dot, the ellipse formed by projecting a circle lying on the plane of the ground onto the screen, and I can't seem to figure out the formula for this ellipse.</p>

<p>I'm reminded vaguely of the mean value theorem for harmonic functions (and solutions of the heat equation), which states that the mean value of any harmonic function $f$ over any set of concentric circles is constant.

<p>Perhaps the above question can then be rephrased as follows:</p>

<p>Is there any surface on which we can define some harmonic function for which $\mu(u,v,d)=d/C(u,v,d)$, in which case we get by the mean value theorem that $\pi$ is constant per point, and further is there any such surface+harmonic function combination for which $\mu(u,v,d)=d/C=const.$ ?</p>

<p>where $s_n, t_n$ are complex sequences (I'm working through Rudin's baby rudin, and I did this proof slightly different than him, so I would like it if someone took the time to look through my proof and verify whether it's correct)</p>

<p><strong>My attempt (scratch proof: finding the appropriate epsilons etc):</strong></p>

<p>By definition of limit, there are positive integers $N_1,N_2$ such that:</p>

<p>$$n &gt;N_1 \Rightarrow |s_n - L_1| &lt;\epsilon'$$
$$n &gt;N_2 \Rightarrow |t_n - L_2| &lt;\epsilon''$$</p>

<p>where we can freely choose $\epsilon', \epsilon'' &gt;0$</p>

<p>Let $\epsilon &gt; 0$</p>

<p>Now, if $n &gt; \max\{N_1,N_2\}$, then:</p>

<p>$$|s_nt_n - L_1L_2| = |s_n(t_n - L_2) + s_nL_2 - L_1L_2|$$
$$\leq |s_n||t_n - L_2| + |L_2||s_n - L_1|$$
$$\leq |s_n|\epsilon'' + |L_2|\epsilon'$$</p>

<p>We want this expression to be smaller than $\epsilon$, but we can't make our $\epsilon$ depend on $n$, therefore we have to find an upper bound for $|s_n|$ </p>

<p>There is a positive integer $N_3$ such that:</p>

<p>$$n &gt; N_3 \Rightarrow |s_n - L_1| &lt; 1$$
$$\Rightarrow |s_n| &lt; 1 + |L_1|$$</p>

<p>so for $n &gt; \max\{N_1,N_2,N_3\}$, we have:</p>

<p>$$ |s_n|\epsilon'' + |L_2|\epsilon' &lt; (1 + |L_1|)\epsilon'' + |L_2|\epsilon'$$</p>

<p>and by chosing $\epsilon'' = \epsilon' = \frac{\epsilon}{1+|L_1|+|L_2|}$, the expression becomes smaller than $\epsilon$</p>

<p><strong>Rigorous proof</strong></p>

<p>Let $\epsilon &gt; 0$</p>

<p>By definition of limit, there are positive integers $N_1,N_2, N_3$ such that:</p>

<p>$$n &gt;N_1 \Rightarrow |s_n - L_1| &lt;\frac{\epsilon}{1+|L_1|+|L_2|}$$
$$n &gt;N_2 \Rightarrow |t_n - L_2| &lt;\frac{\epsilon}{1+|L_1|+|L_2|}$$
$$n &gt; N_3 \Rightarrow |s_n - L_1| &lt; 1 \Rightarrow |s_n| &lt; 1 + |L_1|$$</p>

<p>and for $n &gt; \max\{N_1,N_2,N_3\}$, we have:</p>

<p>$$|s_nt_n - L_1L_2| = |s_n(t_n - L_2) + s_nL_2 - L_1L_2|$$
$$\leq |s_n||t_n - L_2| + |L_2||s_n - L_1|$$
$$&lt; (1 + |L_1|)\frac{\epsilon}{1+|L_1|+|L_2|} + |L_2|\frac{\epsilon}{1+|L_1|+|L_2|} = \frac{\epsilon}{1+|L_1|+|L_2|}(1+ |L_1| + |L_2|) = \epsilon$$</p>

<p><strong>Alternative proof:</strong></p>

<p>Let $\epsilon &gt; 0$</p>

<p>$(s_n)$ converges, so $(|s_n|)$ converges and it is bounded, meaning that there is a positive real number $S$ such that $|s_n| \leq S$ for every positive $n$.</p>

<p>By definition of limit, there are positive integers $N_1,N_2$ such that:</p>

<p>$$n &gt;N_1 \Rightarrow |s_n - L_1| &lt;\frac{\epsilon}{S + |L_2|}$$
$$n &gt;N_2 \Rightarrow |t_n - L_2| &lt;\frac{\epsilon}{S + |L_2|}$$</p>

<p>Now, for $n &gt; \max\{N_1,N_2\}$, we have:</p>

<p>$$|s_nt_n - L_1L_2| = |s_n(t_n - L_2) + s_nL_2 - L_1L_2|$$
$$\leq |s_n||t_n - L_2| + |L_2||s_n - L_1|$$
$$&lt; (S+|L_2|)\frac{\epsilon}{S + |L_2|} = \epsilon $$</p>

<p>Note that this wouldn't work whenever $S + |L_2| = 0$. However, if $S=0$, then $s_n$ is the null-sequence and the theorem is trivial, so we can safely assume $S \neq 0$ such that the denominator never becomes $0$.</p>

"2389039","2389216","Proof Verification: If $w_1,...,w_k\in V$ in linear independent, then so is $[w_1]_B,...,[w_k]_B$","<p>Question:  </p>

<p>Let $B=\{b_1,...,b_n\}$ be the basis of vector space $V$. Prove that
if $w_1,...,w_k\in V$ are linear independent, then so are $[w_1]_B,...,[w_k]_B$.</p>

<p>Preliminaries:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>According to the definition of linear dependence, a group of $n$ vectors are linearly dependent if $\exists \alpha_1,...\alpha_n|\alpha_1v_1+...+\alpha_nv_n=0$</p></li>
<li><p>According to the definition of coordinate spaces,<br>
$[w]_B=\left( \begin{array} cc_1\\...\\c_n \end{array} \right)$ such that $w=c_1b_1+...+c_nb_n$.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My Proof:</p>

<p>Proof by negation:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If $w_1,...,w_k\in V$ are linearly independent: $\forall\alpha_1,...,\alpha_k:\alpha_1(c_{1,1}b_1+...+c_{1,n}b_n)+...+\alpha_k(c_{k,1}b_1+...+c_{k.n}b_n)\ne0$<br>
Moved around a bit to form:
$\forall\alpha_1,...,\alpha_k:b_1(\alpha_1c_{1,1}+...+\alpha_kc_{k,1})+...+b_n(\alpha_1c_{1,n}+...+\alpha_kc_{k,n})\ne0$</p></li>
<li><p>Let $[w_1]_B,...,[w_k]_B$ be linearly dependent: $\exists\beta_1,...,\beta_k:\beta_1\left( \begin{array} cc_{1,1}\\...\\c_{1,n} \end{array} \right)+...+\beta_k\left( \begin{array} cc_{k,1}\\...\\c_{k,n} \end{array} \right)=\left( \begin{array} c0\\...\\0 \end{array} \right)$<br>
Which tells us:<br>
$\begin{cases}\beta_1c_{1,1}+...+\beta_kc_{k,1}=0\\\beta_1c_{1,n}+...+\beta_kc_{k,n}=0\end{cases}$</p></li>
<li><p>Let $\forall1\le i\le k:\alpha_i=\beta_i$ causing (1) to become $b_1(0)+...+b(0)=0\ne0$ ('$...$' can be ignored in this case.) which is a contradiction$\blacksquare$</p></li>

"2389403","2389415","Why does the difference between squares of the $i^{th}$ even and odd integers increase by 4?","<p>I've been trying to find a formula for sum of the first n squares of odd numbers (a question from Spivak's calculus) and I was trying to subtract the the $i^{th}$ odd number from the $i^{th}$ even number, I've noticed that the the difference between the squares is (or seems to be) increasing by 4. This what I'm seeing:
\begin{align*}
2 ^ 2 - 1 ^ 2 = 3\\
4 ^ 2 - 3 ^ 2 = 7 \\
6 ^ 2 - 5 ^ 2 = 11 \\
8 ^ 2 - 7 ^ 2 = 15 \\
10 ^ 2 - 9 ^ 2 = 19 \\
12 ^ 2 - 11 ^ 2 = 23
\end{align*}
Every consecutive term in $3,7,11,15,19,23$ differs by 4. The fact that the difference of the squares for the $i^{th}$ even and odd integers increases by 4 seems completely arbitrary. Why 4? Is there something going on that I'm just missing? I don't know if it has something to do with Dirichlet's arithmetic progression for $4n + 3$. The pattern indicates this formula to me:
$$ \sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k)^2 = \sum_{k=1}^{n}(2k-1)^2 + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(4k+3) $$
I believe this formula is true (though I haven't proved it yet), this will make it possible for me to use the closed form: $$\sum_{k=1}^{2n}k^2 = \frac{n(2n+1)(4n+1)}{3}$$</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I have no difficulty in arriving at the identity given that $A^K = 0$, however I think there is something wrong here... Consider the following: </p>

<p>Let $A$ be a square matrix <strong>not equal to 0</strong>, such that $A^K=0$ for some nonnegative integer $K \ge 2$, and assume for contradiction that $A^{-1}$ exists. Then we can deduce the following:</p>

<p>$$A^K=0 \implies A^K A^{-1}=0 \implies A^{K-1} A A^{-1} = 0 \implies A^{K-1} I = 0$$</p>

<p>and we are left with $A^{K-1} = 0$.</p>

<p>Thus, $A^K=0 \implies A^{K-1} = 0$, and using the same logic (multiplying by $A^{-1}$), we deduce $A^K=0 \implies A^{K-1} = 0 \implies \cdots \implies A^2 = 0 \implies A = 0$, a contradiction. Thus, the three statements ""$A$ does not equal $0$"", ""$A^{-1}$ exists"" and ""$A^K=0$ for some nonnegative integer $K$ greater than or equal to $2$"" cannot all be true at the same time. And thus the task in the book is inncorrect since it states that $A^{-1}$ exists.</p>

$$ \zeta(3)=\frac{5}{2}\sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^3\binom{2n}{n}}\tag{1} $$
(crucial for Apery's proof of $\zeta(3)\not\in\mathbb{Q}$) follows from creative telescoping. The proof can be found at page $5$ of <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxKdOVsjsuEwdjBEM1dpRkhMa2s/view"" rel=""noreferrer"">my notes</a>, too. Today I realized that $(1)$ is also a consequence of
$$ \text{Li}_2\left(\frac{1}{\varphi^2}\right) = \sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{1}{n^2 \varphi^{2n}}=\frac{\pi^2}{15}-\log^2\varphi \tag{2}$$
with $\varphi$ being the golden ratio $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$. The proof of such statement, together with some consequences of it, will soon appear at the end of this post. Now my actual question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the implication $(2)\rightarrow(1)$ already known in the literature?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>For starters, $(2)$ is a simple consequence of $\varphi^2=\varphi+1$ and the functional identities fulfilled by the <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dilogarithm.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">dilogarithm</a> function. The same principle easily leads to
$$ \text{Li}_3\left(\frac{1}{\varphi^2}\right) = \frac{4}{5}\zeta(3)+\frac{2}{3}\log^3\varphi-\frac{2\pi^2}{15}\log\varphi. \tag{3}$$
Since by partial fraction decomposition we have
$$ I\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\frac{1}{8}\int_{\frac{1}{\varphi^2}}^{1}\frac{(u+1)\log^2(u)}{u(1-u)}\,du = \frac{1}{32}\left[-2\log(u)\log(1-u)+\frac{\log^3(u)}{3}-4\log(u)\text{Li}_2(u)-4\text{Li}_3(u)\right]_{1/\varphi^2}^{1}\tag{4} $$
it follows that $I=\frac{1}{10}\zeta(3)$. If we enforce the substitution $u\mapsto\frac{1-t}{1+t}$ we get:
$$ \frac{1}{10}\zeta(3) = \int_{0}^{\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}}\frac{\text{arctanh}^2(t)}{t(1-t^2)}\,dt\stackrel{t\mapsto \tanh x}{=}\int_{0}^{\log\varphi}x^2\coth(x)\,dx \tag{5}$$
then by enforcing the substitution $x\mapsto\text{arcsinh}(v)$ we get:
$$ \frac{1}{10}\zeta(3) = \int_{0}^{1/2}\frac{\text{arcsinh}^2(v)}{v}\,dv\tag{6} $$
and since the Taylor series of $\arcsin^2$ or $\text{arcsinh}^2$ at the origin <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/878477/a-closed-form-of-sum-k-0-infty-frac-1k1k-gamma2-left-frack2"">is well-known</a>, $(1)$ just follows by termwise integration. Since $\coth(z)=\frac{1}{z}+\sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{2z}{z^2+\pi^2 n^2}$, $(5)$ also implies:
$$\begin{eqnarray*} \frac{1}{10}\zeta(3)&amp;=&amp;\frac{1}{2}\log^2\varphi+\sum_{n\geq 1}\left[\log^2\varphi-\pi^2 n^2\log\left(1+\frac{\log^2\varphi}{\pi^2 n^2}\right)\right]\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{3}{2}\log^2\varphi-\pi^2\log\left(1+\frac{\log^2\varphi}{\pi^2}\right)+\sum_{m\geq 2}\frac{(-1)^m\log^{2m}(\varphi)}{m \pi^{2m-2}}\left(\zeta(2m-2)-1\right).\tag{7}\end{eqnarray*}$$</p>

<p>(from Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms (Hubbard and Hubbard))</p>

<p>My proof is for the first statement (the if, not the only if).</p>

<hr>

<p>First, to avoid confusion, the argument of the function $\phi$ will be renamed to $\epsilon'$.By the definition of the limit, the statement that $\lim_{\epsilon \to 0}\phi(\epsilon) = 0$ is the same as saying that $$\forall\epsilon &gt;0, \exists \delta &gt; 0 \text{ such that } |\epsilon'| \leq \delta \implies |\phi(\epsilon')| \leq \epsilon $$</p>

<p>By assumption, $|a_n - a| \leq \phi(\epsilon')$, and from the statement above, we get</p>

<p>$$|a_n - a| \leq \phi(\epsilon') \leq \epsilon$$
We want $\phi(\epsilon') \leq \epsilon'$. However, since it must be true for all $\epsilon$ and all $\epsilon'$ greater than 0, the two can be taken to be equal. Therefore,
$$|a_n-a| \leq \epsilon'$$</p>

<p>Let $y \in \mathcal H^*$, $f \neq 0$ be arbitrary. Denote by $N$ the kernel ker$(f)$ of $f$ and let $z' \in \mathcal H$ with $f(z') = 1$. Since $N$ is closed and $ \mathcal H$ is complete, we can decompose $z'$ as $u + z$ with
$u ∈ N$ and $z ∈ N^{⊥}$. Then $1 = f(z') = f(u) + f(z) = f(z)$. For arbitrary $x \in \mathcal H$, we have $x - f(x)z \in$ ker$(f)$, which implies $f(x) = \langle f(x)z \,,\,||z||^{-2}z\rangle = \langle (x-f(x)z) + f(x)z\,,\,||z||^{-2}z\rangle = \langle x \,,\,||z||^{-2}z\rangle = f_y(x)$, for $y:= ||z||^{-2}z$.

"2389587","2390668","Existence of a map of algebras over a ring which is not a map of algebras over another ring","<p>I am trying to find a counterexample for a general statement that I thought to be true until not so long ago, but that now I suspect to be false. I believe that a very special case of the statement can be stated as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question:</strong> Let $(t)$ be the ideal generated by $t$ in the $k$-algebra $k[[t]]$ of infinite power series over $t$. Then $(t)$ is also a module over the polynomial ring $k[t]$. Is every homomorphism of $(t)$ to itself as a $k[t]$-module also a homomorphism as a $k[[t]]$-module?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe it to be false because, as a $k[[t]]$-algebra, $(t)$ is free over $t$, while as a $k[t]$-module it cannot be generated by a single element. However, requiring that the morphisms respect the multiplicative structure is a pretty strong requirement...</p>

<p>I believe a possible counterexample to the statement might be given by defining $\phi(t^n)=t^n$ for any $n\ge0$, but $\phi(S(t))=0$ for some infinite power series (i.e. not a polynomial) $S(t)$. This is not trivial to construct, though. For example, we cannot set $\phi(S(t))=0$ for <strong>all</strong> infinite series $S(t)$, else
$$0=\phi\left(\sum_{n\ge1}t^n\right)=\phi(t)+\phi\left(\sum_{n\ge2}t^n\right)=\phi(t)=t\ ,$$
which is a contradiction.</p>

<p>I would prefer a constructive example of such a map $\phi$ (or a proof that the statement above is true, of course), but an existence example would also be fine.</p>

"2389762","2389994","Constructing functors between categories and their duals","<p>Perhaps this question has a trivial answer, but it eludes me.  I am thinking about functors between categories and their duals, specifically for the category $ \textbf{Rel}\ $ and its dual $ \textbf{Rel*}\ $, but if possible I'd like to approach this as a general question concerning the notion of ""turning around the arrows"" to form a dual.</p>

<p>Here's my problem: Suppose we want to find a functor $ F $ from a category $ C $ to its dual $ C* $ such that the functor takes each morphism and  object in $ C $ to a exactly one morphism or object in $ C* $.  For me, the problem arises because ""turn the arrow around"" is not a valid operation for a functor.  </p>

<p>Of course for a single morphism  $ f \colon A \to B $  we can effectively turn that particular arrow around by letting $ F(A)=B $ and $ F(B) = A $.  But, thinking geometrically, whenever we simply switch $ A $ and $ B $ , we no longer have other arrows pointing correctly from $ A $ or $ B $ to all the other objects, $ C, D, E,... $, etc.</p>

<p>Using the strict definition of a functor as two functions (one function for objects to objects, and one function for morphisms to morphisms), how do we know there is a functor that connects a category to its dual in the bijective fashion as described above?</p>

<p>If $ \ ((a,b), (c,d)) \in R$ and $ \ ((c,d), (e,f)) \in R \implies \  a + 2d = c+2b\ $ and $\  c + 2f = e + 2d \implies a + 2d + c + 2f = c+2b + e + 2d \implies a + 2f = 2b + e \implies a + 2f = e + 2b \implies ((a,b),(e,f)) \in R$ </p>

Thus,$$\mathbb E=\mathbb Q(e^{i3\pi/4},-e^{i3\pi/4},e^{i\pi/4},-e^{i3\pi/4}).$$Since $e^{i3\pi/4}$ can be obtained by taking the cube of $e^{i\pi/4}$.Thus,$\mathbb E=\mathbb Q(e^{i\pi/4})=\mathbb Q(\frac{1+i}{\sqrt 2})$.</p>

  <p>TLDR: simplify $\phi-2\arctan\left(\frac{s\sin(\phi-\omega)}{q+s\cos(\phi-\omega)}\right)$ as much as possible for the benefit of using $\phi$ as a variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a sinusoid $f(\theta) = q+s\cos(\theta-\omega)$, and I wish to create a second sinusoid with the same period that is tangent to this and the $\theta$ axis, with the point of tangency to the sinusoid at $(\phi, f(\phi))$.  This is to say I am looking for functions $g_\phi(\theta) = k_\phi(1+\cos(\theta-\rho_\phi))$ where $g_\phi(\phi) = f(\phi)$ and $g'_\phi(\phi)=f'(\phi)$.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BKnCc.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BKnCc.gif"" alt=""an animation of the kinds of sinusoids I&#39;m looking for""></a></p>

<p>As you can see by my lovely animation here I've technically already solved it; I can find the appropriate $k_\phi$ and $\rho_\phi$ with relative ease.  The problem, though, is <strong>tractibility</strong>.  This is only one step in a larger problem in orbital mechanics, and after finding $k_\phi$ and $\rho_\phi$ I will need to manipulate them further by adding $g_\phi$ to another sinusoid and then perform some calculus in terms of $\phi$.  So the nicer I can make it in terms of $\phi$ the better off I am.</p>

<p>$k_\phi$ I've already gotten a decent result for, or as close as I can hope for; it's $$k_\phi = q+\frac{s^2-q^2}{2(q+s\cos(\phi-\omega))}=\frac{q^2+s^2+2qs\cos(\phi-\omega)}{2(q+s\cos(\phi-\omega))}$$</p>

<p>But $\rho_\phi$ is rather meaner:</p>

<p>$$\rho_\phi = \phi-2\arctan\left(\frac{s\sin(\phi-\omega)}{q+s\cos(\phi-\omega)}\right)$$</p>

<p>I've tried simplifying this and I've come to the conclusion that I'm just plain not good enough at trigonometry to do it.  I've also asked Sage and Wolfram Alpha for help; Sage doesn't seem to even recognize trigonometric identities, and Wolfram Alpha either does nothing to it or rejects my input as too long.</p>

<p>One path I find interesting is that many parts of my results are similar to results from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasor#Addition"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">phasor addition</a>: $q\cos(\theta) + s\cos(\theta + \omega - \phi) = (q^2+s^2+2qs\cos(\phi-\omega))\cos\left(\theta + \arctan\left(\frac{s\sin(\phi-\omega)}{q+s\cos(\phi-\omega)}\right)\right)$</p>

<p>But I haven't been able to get that to help me any yet: the $-2$ doesn't help.  It's possible that $g_\phi$ might be better expressed as the sum of several less annoying sinusoids, which would work fine too.</p>

These correspond to $H_1 = \langle \sigma ^2,\tau \sigma^3 \rangle$, $H_2 = \langle \tau \sigma^3 \rangle$ and $H_3 = \langle \sigma^4 \rangle$ in $\text{Gal}(\mathbb Q(i,\sqrt[8]{2})/\mathbb Q)$, where:</p>

  <p>Calculate $\oint F\cdot dr$ on the curve which is created by the intersection of plane $z=2x$ and paraboloid $z=x^2+y^2$. Suppose the direction of the curve is anti-clockwise. Let the field be $F=\langle 0,0,y\rangle$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First the definition of $\oint F\cdot dr$ used in my class:
$$
\oint F\cdot dr=\oint F\cdot\langle dx,dy,dz\rangle
$$
Now according to Stokes' theorem:
$$
\oint F\cdot dr=\iint \operatorname{curl}F\cdot n\cdot dS
$$
where $n$ is the normal unit vector to the surface.</p>

<p>As far as I understand our curve is a circle with the center at $(1,0)$ and with radius $r=1$:
$$
x^2+y^2=2x\\
(x-1)^2+y^2=1
$$
so $n=\frac{\langle -2,0,1\rangle}{\sqrt 5}$
Therefore:
$$
\iint_D \operatorname{curl}F\cdot n\cdot dS=\iint_D \langle 1,0,0\rangle\cdot\frac{\langle -2,0,1\rangle}{\sqrt 5}dS=\\
=-\frac{2}{\sqrt 5}\iint_D dS
$$
Because our curve is the circumference of the circle so $\iint_DdS=\pi r^2=\pi$.</p>

<p>Thus $\oint F\cdot dr=-\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt 5}$.</p>

<p>But the answer is incorrect as the correct solution is $-2\pi$. I assume that if I didn't normalize $n$ my answer would be correct but $n$ should be normalized as far as I understand.</p>

<p>Now I tried to see the Taylor Series of $\arccos(1-y)$ as $y\rightarrow 0$, $y=\frac{4}{n+4}$.</p>

<p>By deriving $g(y)=\arccos(1-y)$ I obtain:</p>

<p>$$g'(y)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(1-y)^2}}=(-x^2+2x)^{\frac{1}{2}}=(2x)^{\frac{1}{2}}(1-\frac{x}{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt{2y}+o(\sqrt{2y})$$</p>

<p>So I see that:</p>

<p>$$g(y)=\int\frac{1}{\sqrt{2y}}+o\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2x}}\right)dx=\sqrt{2x}+o(\sqrt{2x})$$</p>

<p>From this, I can conclude that my series is:</p>

<p>$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\arccos\left(1-\frac{4}{n+4}\right)\right)^{\alpha} \sim \left(\sqrt{\frac{8}{n+4}}\right)^{\alpha}$$</p>

"2390555","2390624","Poisson equation solution - regularity of the solution","<p>The theorem states that if $f \in C^{2}_{0}(\mathbb R^{n})$, then function
$u(x) = \int_{\mathbb R^{n}} \phi(x-y)f(y)dy$ is the solution of
$-\Delta u(x)=f(x)$ and $u \in C^{2}(\mathbb R^{n})$. ($\phi$ is the fundamental Laplace equation solution)</p>

<p>I have a problem with the latter statement, I don't quite understand the proof. I know I can differentiate twice under the integral sign, but don't understand the proof of continuity of the second derivative.</p>

<p>We have $u_{x_{i}x_{j}}(x) = \int_{\mathbb R^{n}} \phi(y)f_{x_{i}x_{j}}(x-y)dy$ for $i,j=1,2,...,n$. Now I want to prove the continuity of this partial derivative. It is done through Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem. I would do something like this:</p>

<p>Let $x_{0} \in \mathbb R^{n}$ and $\{x_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be any sequence convergent to $x_{0}$. Now we have:</p>

<p>$\lim_{n\to \infty} u_{x_{i}x_{j}}(x_{n}) = \lim_{n\to \infty} \int_{\mathbb R^n} \phi(y)f_{x_{i}x_{j}}(x_n -y)dy$</p>

<p>Now how to explain the interchange of integral sign and the limit using dominated convergence theorem? How to define a proper sequence of functions? I know that after this step it will be pretty easy to finish the proof because the support of $f$ is a compact set and $\phi$ is locally integrable, so the integral is bounded. Some definitons come to my mind as $g_n(x) := \phi(y)f(x_n -y)$ but it doesn't make sense to me as $g_n$ doesn't depend on $x$ and now I have a problem with $\phi$ as it is unbounded on any set containing $0$.</p>

<p>EDIT: I wonder if it could be done another way. I know that $f$ is bounded for any $y\in supp f$. Thus:</p>

<p>$|u_{x_{i}x_{j}}(x_n) - u_{x_{i}x_{j}}(x_0)| \le \sup_{y\in suppf}|f_{x_{i}x_{j}}(x_n -y) - f_{x_{i}x_{j}}(x_0 -y)|\int_{V} \phi(y)dy$,
where $V$ is some compact set. </p>

<p>Now taking the limit $n\to \infty$ we get the continuity of $u_{x_{i}x_{j}}$ as the supremum converges to $0$ and $\phi$ is locally integrable. Is it OK?</p>

<li>B1 x B2 = 36 events - That is an ordered pair containing first M&amp;M from B1 and the other from B2.</li>
<li>B2 x Tan (from B1) = 6 events</li>
<li>B1 x Blue (from B2) = 6 events</li>

<p>So in total we have 48 possible events. (Please confirm)</p>

<p>However since the weight of each event varies because of difference in frequency of each colour the probability of each of these 48 events is not equally likely. Sum of the probability of all these events should be unity though. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $F = \mathbb{Q}$, $w = \sqrt{2}+\sqrt[3]{2}$.</p>
  
  <p>The element $w$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$ because it belongs to a finitely generated extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt[3]{2})$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ by two algebraic elements $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt[3]{2}$.</p>
  
  <p>We consider $G = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt[3]{2})$ as two subsequent simple extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$.</p>
  
  <p>First, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ is an extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ by a root of the irreducible polynomial $x^{2} - 2$. The normal form of an element of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ is $$ a + b\sqrt{2}, \qquad a,b \in \mathbb{Q}$$</p>
  
  <p>Now, $G = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})(\sqrt[3]{2})$.</p>
  
  <p>The element $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is a root of the polynomial $x^{3}-2$.</p>
  
  <p>Since this polynomial is of degree $3$, it is irreducible iff it has no roots in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ - i.e., if and only if $\sqrt[3]{2} \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$.</p>
  
  <p>Suppose $\sqrt[3]{2} = a + b\sqrt{2}, \qquad a,b \in \mathbb{Q}$.</p>
  
  <p>Cubing this, we obtain $2 = (a^{3}+6ab^{2}) + (3a^{2}b+2b^{3})\sqrt{2}$.</p>
  
  <p>If $3a^{2}b+2b^{3} \neq 0$, then we can solve this equation for $\sqrt{2}$ in terms of $a$ and $b$ which implies that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational, a contradiction.</p>
  
  <p>If $b = 0$, then $\sqrt[3]{2} = a$, which implies that $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is rational, which it is not (right?). Contradiction.</p>
  
  <p>If $a = 0$, then $\sqrt[3]{2} = b\sqrt{2} \, \implies \, \left( \frac{\sqrt[3]{2}}{2}\right)\sqrt{2} = b\, \implies\, $ $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Contradiction.</p>
  
  <p>So, $b \neq 0$, $a \neq 0$, but $3a^{2}b + 2b^{3} = 0$, so we must have that $3a^{2}b = -2b^{3} \, \implies -\frac{3}{2} = \frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}\, \implies \, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}}i = \frac{a}{b}$, but since $a,b \in \mathbb{Q}$, their ratio cannot be a complex number. Contradiction.</p>
  
  <p>This shows that $\sqrt[3]{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$. Therefore, $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt[3]{2}): \mathbb{Q}]=4$.</p>
  
  <p>So, we need at most $5$ powers, $1, w, \cdots, w^{4}$ of $w$ to obtain a linear dependency over $\mathbb{Q}$.</p>
  
  <p>Note that any element of $G = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt[3]{2})$ can be written uniquely in the form $$ (a+b\sqrt{2}) + (c+d\sqrt{2})\sqrt[3]{2}, \qquad a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{Q}$$</p>
  
  <p>or equivalently, $$a + b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt[3]{2}+d\sqrt{2}\sqrt[3]{2}\, \qquad a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{Q}$$</p>
  
  <p>So, the set $\{1, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt{2}\sqrt[3]{2} \}$ spans $G$ and is not linearly dependent over $\mathbb{Q}$, so it is a basis of $G$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.</p>

<p>I came across this when I was solving a problem on probability. Just for your reference, the problem, translated into English, is as follows:</p>

<p>A and B are two gamblers. In each round of a game, they have equal chances to win (that is, the probability of winning is 1/2). Before the game started, they had agreed that the one that wins a certain number of rounds first can get all the money (say, 1000 pounds). However, the gambling is interrupted for some reason. At this point, gambler A has to win $n$ more rounds in order to get all the money, while gambler B has to win $m$ more rounds. The question is, if it is impossible for the game to go on, how much of the 1000 pounds should be given to gamblers A and B, respectively? (The distribution of the money should be based on the probability of winning if the game had not been interrupted).</p>

<p>Using two different ways of thinking, we can obtain two different expressions for the probability of gambler A winning the money (had the game not been interrupted). They are:</p>

<p>$$\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n+\binom{n}{1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n+1}+\binom{n+1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n+2}+\cdots+\binom{n+m-2}{m-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n+m-1}$$

I am wondering if there are simple ways to transform one side into the other. If not, how can we prove this identity? Thank you for your generous help!</p>

"2390694","2391768","Discrete approximations of Riemannian geometry","<p>I am looking for the appropriate way to talk about a discrete geometry approaching a continuous Riemannian geometry. </p>

<p>By a discrete geometry I mean something like a graph or cell-complex, perhaps with additional data. </p>

<p>By approaching a continuous geometry I approximately mean something like the following.  Take the discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z}/N)^2$, the $N\times N$ grid with opposite ends identified. In the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$ this clearly ""approaches"" in some sense the usual torus $T^2$, with the flat metric.    </p>

<p>One way this approach happens is via the graph Laplacian on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. The spectrum of its lowest eigenvalues converges to the spectrum of the continuous Laplacian on $T^2$ as $N\rightarrow \infty$. Which is just a fancy way of saying that ""coarse-grained"" the two look alike. </p>

<p>This example of $\mathbb{Z}/N \rightarrow T^2$ has many non-generic properties that I do not wish to rely on, for example they both have a global translation symmetry and there is a natural embedding of the discrete geometry into the continuous. </p>

<p>To be more general, take a torus $M$ with a generic metric with bounded curvature - we can imagine the following discrete approximations to it:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The graph given by a locally optimal circle packing in $M$ with circle of radius $r$. As $r\rightarrow 0$ this should ""converge"" to $M$.</p></li>
<li><p>Given $d$ and $\epsilon$, Select $d^2$ random points according to the uniform distribution on $M$. Write the graph where two points $x$ and $y$ are connected if the geodesic distance between them on $M$ is less than $\epsilon$. </p></li>
<li><p>Select $d^2$ random points, and form the Voronoi diagram on $M$, and label each cell by it's area. This gives a cell complex which ""approximates"" $M$.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Has anyone studied, and under what name, these sorts of convergence problems? Is there more to be said than graph spectral theory.</p>

<p>What I would be most interested in is if for some discrete data like this, there were a direct discrete analog of the usual objects of Riemannian geometry. For example, is there some way to attach to a graph a ""discrete Christofel symbol"" to a graph? Just to throw something out there: parallel transport maps the tangent space of point $a$ to the tangent space of point $b$ given a curve from $a$ to $b$, so perhaps the ""discrete Christofel symbol"", maps a linear combination of edges connected to $a$ to a linear combination of edges connected to $b$.</p>

<p>(Incidentally there is a question titled <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/186076/is-there-such-a-thing-as-discrete-riemannian-geometry"">Is there such a thing as discrete Riemannian geometry?</a> but it seems to be unrelated.)</p>

So I used the formula $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, and used $x = \|cos(x)| * y$ to find the x rotation, and $\|sin(x)| * y$ to find the y rotation. The thought was that when working backwards like this, I could use the original x and y values from the formula and multiply them by $y$ to create a ratio as to how far each of these went; This sorta worked, but did not give the desired result. </p>

<p>My idea:</p>

<p>(1) The main problem is to find subgroups of order $p$. Any subgroup of order $p$ is of the form $$H=\langle(a,b)\rangle$$ where one of $a$ or $b$ is nonzero.</p>

<p>(2) For $0\leq i\leq p-1$, define the subgroup $$H_i=\langle(1,i)\rangle.$$ Define the subgroup $$K=\langle (0,1)\rangle.$$ Then the subgroups $K, H_0,\dots, H_{p-1}$ are distinct subgroups of order $p$.</p>

<p>(3) We claim that $$G=\left(\bigcup_{i=0}^{p-1}H_i\right)\bigcup K.$$ This follows from calculating the cardinality of the union. The subgroups $K, H_0,\dots, H_{p-1}$ are distinct subgroups of order $p$. Any two distinct subgroups of order $p$ intersect only at $(0,0)$. There are $p+1$ subgroups in the union and each of them contains $p-1$ nontrivial elements. So the cardinality of the union is 
$$\left|\left(\bigcup_{i=0}^{p-1}H_i\right)\bigcup K\right|=(p+1)(p-1)+1=p^2=|G|$$</p>

<p>(4) Since $$G=\left(\bigcup_{i=0}^{p-1}H_i\right)\bigcup K$$ if $\langle(a,b)\rangle$ is any subgroup of order $p$, then $\langle(a,b)\rangle$ is already considered in the union. Therefore $K, H_0,\dots, H_{p-1}$ are precisely all the distinct subgroups of order $p$.</p>

<p>(5) So the total number of subgroups of order $p$ is $p+1$. Hence the total number of subgroups is $p+3$. </p>

<p>Is my calculation correct? What are the other methods to solve this problem?</p>

"2390875","2391286","Confusion about Notation for Twisting Sheaf and Very Ample Invertible Sheaves","<p>I'm a bit confused by some notation in Hartshorne's chapter II (theorems II.5.17, II.7.6, and some discussion on ample invertible sheaves in section 7).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 5.17</strong> (Serre). Let $X$ be a projective scheme over a noetherian ring $A$, let $\mathcal{O}(1)$ be a very ample invertible sheaf on $X$, and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-module. Then there is an integer $n_0$ such that for all $n \geq n_0$, the sheaf $\mathcal{F}(n)$ can be generated by a finite number of global sections.</p>
  
  <p><em>Proof.</em> Let $i: X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}_A^r$ be a closed immersion of $X$ into a projective space $A$, such that $i^*(\mathcal{O}(1)) = \mathcal{O}_X(1)$... [The remainder of the paragraph is devoted to reducing to the case where $X$ is Proj of a polynomial ring.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, what is meant by the hypothesis ""$\mathcal{O}(1)$ be a very ample invertible sheaf on $X$"", since, a priori, $X$ is not projective space or Proj of a graded ring? I see that one can appeal to Corollary 5.16 to see that $X$ is $\mathrm{Proj}(S)$ for some graded ring $S$, finitely generated by $S_1$ as an $S_0 = A$-algebra. Then one can take $\mathcal{O}(1) = \widetilde{S(1)}$. Then this is very ample since we can use the description of $S$ to construct a closed immersion $i: X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}_A^r$ with $i^*(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}_A^r}(1)) = \mathcal{O}_X(1)$ (by Proposition 5.12(c)), which is just $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Is this the correct interpretation?</p>

<p>Second, on p. 153, this result is later quoted as having established: for $\mathcal{L}$ any very ample invertible sheaf on a projective scheme $X$ over $A$, for any coherent $\mathcal{F}$, there is an $n_0$ such that $n \geq n_0$ implies $\mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{L}^n$ is generated by global sections, which appears slightly different than the above result, since we worked with the particular very ample invertible sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$. Based on the above argument, it seems every very ample invertible sheaf over a projective scheme (at least those coming from closed immersions coming from surjective ring maps, by proposition 5.12(c)) will be isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$. Is this true? If it's not, in what sense was the quoted result proven by theorem 5.17? Also, is this rephrasing merely meant to suggest the definition of <em>ample</em> provided on p. 153?</p>

<p>Finally, I am confused about the notation found in the proof of theorem 7.6, in chapter II. The setting is $X$ a scheme of finite type over a noetherian ring $A$, and $\mathcal{L}$ an invertible sheaf on $X$. One direction of the theorem is that if $\mathcal{L}^m$ is very ample implies $\mathcal{L}$ is ample. The proof begins with $i: X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}_A^n$, an immersion with $\mathcal{L}^m \simeq i^*(\mathcal{O}(1))$. Then given any coherent $\mathcal{F}$, consider the closure $\overline{X}$ in projective space and $\overline{\mathcal{F}}$ the coherent sheaf which is the extension of $\mathcal{F}$ to $\overline{X}$. Then it is noted that if $\overline{\mathcal{F}} \otimes \mathcal{O}_{\overline{X}}(l)$ is generated by global sections, hence $\mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{O}_X(l)$ is also. My question is, what is the meaning of $\mathcal{O}_X(l)$? The map $i$ is just an immersion, so we don't know that $X$ is Proj of some graded ring. Is $\mathcal{O}_X(l)$ just a short-hand for $\mathcal{L}^l$?</p>

"2390880","2390898","First order Peano axioms and their intepretation","<p>I am still better trying to understand the first order Peano Axioms and their relation to the standard model. Just for reference, here are the axioms I work with:</p>

<p>$1.\space \forall x (\neg x+1=0)\hspace{2.14cm} 4.\space\forall x\forall y(x+1=y+1 \rightarrow x=y)\\
2.\space\forall x(x+0=x) \hspace{2.41cm} 5.\space\forall x\forall y(x+(y+1)=(x+y)+1)\\
3. \space \forall x(x\times0=0)\hspace{2.41cm} 6. \space \forall x\forall y (x\times(y+1) = (x\times y)+x)\\
 $</p>

<p>As well as the axiom schema of infinite, but countable axioms for induction:</p>

<p>$$7. \space\forall x_1...\forall x_n(\varphi[0/y]\land \forall y( \varphi\rightarrow \varphi[y+1/y]))\rightarrow \forall y\varphi)$$</p>

<p>Now, for correctness to hold, whatever is deduced from these axioms, must hold in every interpretation. But, what I find weird is, it seems these axioms have already defined the function symbols and constants to be equivalent to the structure of $\mathfrak N$, ie. $\{+,\times,0,1\}$, instead of having undefined $f_1,f_2,c_1,c_2$, so as I understand it the mappings are already assigned. How is this allowed, since clearly that's just one interpretation of the functions/constants, while the deduction should apply to every interpretation?</p>

<p>Further if that's the case, do the different possible models of PA concern themselves only with the domain $A$ of the model? I read that there are non-standard models of PA for every cardinality, so what would a model with cardinality of one look like?</p>

"2390882","2390888","Assuming this answer is truthful and correctly written, why isn't the Collatz Conjecture proven (or close to it)?","<p>From <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/a/70722/289789"">this answer</a> we have the following expression:</p>

<p>$$\frac{(abcd) + (abc*3) + (ab*3^2) + (a*3^3) + 3^4}{(abcde) - 3^5}$$</p>

<p>The claim is that when all variables are positive integer powers of $2$, the only positive integer it equals is $1$.</p>

<p>In other words for the following equation we can conjecture a simple statement.</p>

<p>$$\frac{(2^a2^b2^c2^d) + (2^a2^b2^c*3) + (2^a2^b*3^2) + (2^a*3^3) + 3^4}{(2^a2^b2^c2^d2^e) - 3^5} = f$$</p>

<p>If all variables are integers greater than $0$, then $f = 1$. Somehow proving this trivializes the Collatz Conjecture. That's what the answer I linked claims. I don't claim to understand it.</p>

<p>Here's where my confusion comes from.</p>

<hr>

<p>The answer states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It turns out to be fairly easy to prove that if none of the variables are 2, and any of them are greater than 4, then the fraction lies between 0 and 1. So that leaves just this: What happens if one or more of the variables have the value 2? You can get some negative numbers, but we don't care about those. But you can also get some positive numbers greater than 1... they don't appear to be integers; but how do we know they can't be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this means (if I understand correctly) that the only values that the variables other then $f$ can possess is $1$ or $2$. By this reasoning, we have $5$ variables, with a domain of $2$ values. Therefore, there $32$ combinations to check. Doesn't that mean that the Collatz Conjecture is trivially resolvable? Just check all the values with a computer, right?</p>

<p>vector form is $x = p + td$ where $p$ and $d$ are vectors and $t$ is a scalar. To find $p$ I pick a number for $x$ and plug into the equation to get the corresponding $y$. So $x = 0$ gives $y = -1$, so $p = [0, -1]$ because 3 is the scalar multiplied with $x$ and 1 is the scalar multiplied with $y$, I thought the vector form would be: </p>

<p>$$
   \begin{bmatrix} x\\ y\\ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}

"2390923","2392791","How does statistics deal with calculating the odds of an event occurring that seems impossible.","<p>So my thoughts on this lead me to believe that this may be a philosophical question as much as a mathematical question.  That said, I find it hard to believe that no mathematician has ever contemplated the issue.  My hypothetical will sound silly at first but please read through the question because it does raise a serious question.</p>

<p>If one claims that if I can snap my fingers once I will transform into an elephant, and if I clap my hands I will turn into an elephant for a minute then a lion, how would statistics deal with calculating the relative odds of these two occurrences?</p>

<p>One thought is that the odds of the elephant transformation occurring alone is greater than both the elephant and lion transformations.  I think at first this seems logical because the odds of two events happening, more so in sequence,  are generally considered less likely than one of the events. However, after further reflection, I think this answer is wrong.  </p>

<p>My reasoning is that statistics is a science and therefore its assertions must be based on scientific data.  There must be some standard of evidence before anything is accepted as possible.  I think we will all agree that there is zero evidence in all of human history to support the proposition that either event is possible.  Further, all applicable fields of human knowledge would support that it is impossible for either event to happen.  Thus, IMO, absent any evidence to contradict all applicable human experience, statistics, as a science, must conclude that both the elephant event alone and the elephant + lion event must be considered to have an equal 0% chance of occurring.  </p>

<p>While the above hypothetical is silly, this question has real applications in philosophical debates, which I would rather not specifically detail to eliminate the odds of creating bias.</p>

<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

<p>EDIT 1:</p>

<p>Thank you all very much for commenting!  Obviously, some very intelligent people have afforded me some of their valuable time.</p>

<p>I read all of the comments more than once and I must admit, it’s clear that all of the commenter’s proficiency with mathematics so far outpaces my own that at times I find myself struggling to understand some of what is written.  My proficiency is with debate and reason, which is why I came here for guidance.  </p>

<p>Nonetheless, I feel fairly certain I am not getting the answer that must exist, but rather advanced mathematical analysis.  My fault I’m sure so let me rephrase my question.</p>

<p>My judgment and thinking on this subject persuades me that there must be a mathematical axiom that directly deals with my issue. I see now that I should have made that point clear.  My thinking is as follows:</p>

<p>Everyone can remember the classic example of the odds of any outcome in rolling a true six sided die,  one in six.   To my thinking for that to be true certain outcomes must be disregarded because they are impossible by all human experience, such as the die turning into a butterfly and flying away, or the rules of gravity failing to force the die to the floor.  </p>

<p>If such silly outcomes, and countless others, were not eliminated from consideration, the odds of any particular outcome of rolling a six sided die would not be one in six but something less.  So based on this thinking, my question is what is the mathematical axiom that dismisses from a statistical equation these silly outcomes that defy all human experience.</p>

<p>Apologies if I defer from speaking in mathematical ease on this issue but (obviously) I do not have mathematical expertise so I can’t really think well in that language.  Nonetheless, my reasoning tells me there must be a math/scientific axiom that addresses this issue.</p>

<p>EDIT 2:</p>

<p>So Lord Shark the Unknown, user296602, Siong Thye Goh, r.e.s., and BruceET have put a ""hold"" on my inquiry because it is ""off topic.""  </p>

<p>Please explain why so I can respect your opinion and change my inquiry appropriately.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT 3:</p>

<p>Ok so it seems that the answer is that statistics works with the assumptions one brings to the equation and does not extend to evaluating the quality or veracity of those assumptions or the methodologies by which those assumptions are drawn. </p>

<p>Thus, it appears my question is more about scientific method.</p>

This also means ""$x &lt; y$"" since we are in $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$.
We have an element ""$a$"". With ""$\frac{a}{2} &lt; a &lt; 2a$"" we can say that $X$ and $Y$ are not empy. So we can apply the completeness axiom. There must be a ""$c$"" between ""$x$"" and ""$y$"". So $$x \leq c \leq y \Rightarrow x^2 \leq c^2 \leq y^2$$

<p>So suppose $I \subseteq R$ is an ideal of $R$, a UFD. We want to show that if $I$ is square-free, then $I$ is radical. That is, we want to show that if $r^k\in I$ for some $k&gt;1$, then $r \in I$. This might be unnecessary but I split this into two cases:</p>

<p>If $k=2$ then $r^2 \in I$. But $r^2$ divides itself, but $I$ is square-free so $\exists r^{-1}\in R$, hence $r^{-1}r^2 = r \in I$.</p>

<p>In general for $k &gt; 2$, we have that $r^2\cdot r^{k-2} \in I$. But $r^2 \ | \ r^k \in I$, so $I$ being square free implies $r$ is a unit, hence multiplying by its inverse; $(r^{-1})^{k-1}\cdot r^{k}  = r \in I$ as required.</p>

<p>The problem:</p>

<p>In vector space $\Bbb{R}_2[x] = \{ p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c : a, b, c \in \Bbb{R} \}$ an inner product is given, $\langle p, q\rangle = \int\limits_{-1}^1 p(x)q(x)\, \mathrm dx$, where $p, q \in \Bbb{R}_2[x]$. Determine one basis of orthogonal complement of the subspace $U = \mathcal{L}\{ x^2 - 1, x + 1\}$. Find an orthogonal projections of the polynomial $p(x) = 2x^2 + x + 5$ on the $U$ and $U^{\bot}$.</p>

<p>My method:</p>

<p>Because $U^{\bot} = \{ p \in \Bbb{R}_2[x]\,:\,(\forall q \in U):\langle p,q\rangle = 0 \}$, that means $\langle p, x^2- 1\rangle = 0$ and $\langle p, x + 1\rangle = 0$. That means I have to solve these two equations:
$$ \int_{-1}^1 (ax^2 + bx + c)(x^2 - 1) \,\mathrm dx = 0 \tag{1},$$ 
$$ \int_{-1}^1 (ax^2 + bx + c)(x + 1) \,\mathrm dx = 0 \tag{2}.$$
After solving $(1)$ I got $a = -5c, \, (b, c \in\Bbb{R})$ and after solving $(2)$ I got $b = 2c, \, c \in \Bbb{R}$.
Now I can conclude that $U^{\bot} = \{ (-5c)x^2 + 2cx + c : c \in \Bbb{R} \}$.</p>

<p>From there we have that for $p \in U^{\bot}$, $p(x) = c(-5x^2 + 2x + 1)$. Now I can conclude that $U^{\bot} = \mathcal{L}\{ -5x^2 + 2x + 1 \}$.</p>

<p>Question no.1.: Is $-5x^2 + 2x + 1$ a basis of $U^{\bot}$?</p>

<p>I tried to find  the orthogonal projections in the next way:
Let $q \in U,\, r \in U^{\bot}$. Let $ \alpha, \beta, \gamma \in \Bbb{R} $ and 
$$p(x) = q(x) + r(x) \Leftrightarrow 2x^2 + x + 5 = \alpha (x^2 - 1) + \beta (x + 1) + \gamma (-5x^2 + 2x + 1) \tag{3}$$</p>

<p>After solving $(3)$ and getting $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, now I have that:</p>

<ol>
<li>$\alpha (x^2 - 1) + \beta (x + 1)$ is orthofgonal projection on $U$.</li>
<li>$\gamma (-5x^2 + 2x + 1)$ is orthogonal projection on $U^{\bot}$.</li>

<hr>

<p>Some background:</p>

<p><strong>Cohomology theories:</strong></p>

<p>A <em>reduced extraordinary cohomology theory</em> is a sequence of contravariant functors $\tilde E^n$ (for $n \in \mathbb Z$) from CW complexes to abelian groups, with natural transformations $\delta : \tilde E^n(A) \to \tilde E^{n+1}(X/A)$ for CW pairs $(X,A)$ satisfying the following axioms:</p>

<ol>
<li>Homotopy: if $f, g : X \to Y$ are homotopic then the induced maps $f^*,g^* : \tilde E^n(Y) \to \tilde E^n(X)$ are equal.</li>
<li>Exactness: for each CW pair $(X,A)$ there is a long exact sequence
$$... \xrightarrow{\delta} \tilde E^n(X/A) \xrightarrow{q^*} \tilde E^n(X) \xrightarrow{i^*} \tilde E^n(A) \xrightarrow{\delta} \tilde E^{n+1}(X/A) \xrightarrow{q^*} ...$$
where $i$ is the inclusion map $A \to X$ and $q$ is the quotient map $X \to X/A$.</li>
<li>Additivity: For a wedge sum $X = \vee_\alpha X_\alpha$ with inclusions $i_\alpha : X_\alpha \hookrightarrow X$, the product map
$$\prod_\alpha i_\alpha^* : \widetilde E^n(X) \xrightarrow{\cong} \prod_\alpha \widetilde E^n(X_\alpha)$$
is an isomorphism for all $n$.</li>
</ol>

<p>A <em>reduced (ordinary) cohomology theory</em> is a reduced extraordinary cohomology theory satisfying an additional axiom</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li>Dimension: The cohomology groups $\widetilde E^n(*)$ are 0 for all $n$, where $*$ is the space consisting of a point.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Degree</strong></p>

<p>Let $f : S^n \to S^n$. The <em>degree</em> of $f$ is the integer $[f] \in \pi_n(S^n) \cong \mathbb Z$.</p>

<p>See corollary 4.25 of Hatcher for proof $\pi_n(S^n) \cong \mathbb Z$. Corollary 4.25 also tells us that this definition of degree agrees with the usual definition (where the degree of $f : S^n \to S^n$ is the integer $d$ in the induced map on cohomology $f^* : H^n(S^n) \cong \mathbb Z \to H^n(S^n) \cong \mathbb Z : \alpha \mapsto d\alpha$).</p>

<hr>

<p>My proof so far:</p>

<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> If $f : S^n \to S^n$ has degree $d$, then the induced map $f^*$ on any reduced cohomology theory is multiplication by $d$.</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong>
For $d \ge 1$, $f$ is homotopic to
$$g_d : S^n \xrightarrow{\mathrm{pinch}} \vee_d S^n \xrightarrow{\vee \mathrm{id}} S^n$$
(since we know $g_d$ has degree $d$).</p>

<p>If $E$ is any reduced cohomology theory, then
$$
E^k(S^n) \xrightarrow{(\vee \mathrm{id})^*} E^k\left(\vee_d S^n \right) \cong \prod_d E^k(S^n) \xrightarrow{(\mathrm{pinch})^*} E^k(S^n) $$</p>

<p>where $(\vee \mathrm{id})^* : x \mapsto (x,...,x)$ and $(\mathrm{pinch})^*: (x_1,...,x_d) \mapsto \sum_i x_i$.</p>

<p>(Why is $(\mathrm{pinch})^*(x_1,...,x_d) = \sum_i x_i$? When $d = 1$, we know that the pinch map is homotopic to the identity. It follows that $(\mathrm{pinch})^*(0,...,0,x_i,0,...,0) = x_i$ and there is only one homomorphism satisfying this property.) Thus, the composition is multiplication by $d$.</p>

<p>For $d = 0$, $f$ is null-homotopic, so $f^*$ must be multiplication by 0. (Why is the constant map multiplication by 0? It factors through $*$, which has reduced cohomology groups all 0.)</p>

<p>For $d \le -1$, $f$ is homotopic to a reflection $r$ composed with $g_{-d}$, since we know that $r$ has degree $-1$. (By a reflection, we mean a map that fixes a great circle $S^{n-1}$ and interchanges the corresponding hemispheres.) </p>

<p>I want to show that $r^*$ is multiplication by $-1$, but I don't know how. This would then complete the proof.</p>

which is the probability of the event that the maximum surplus before ruin is less than $b$ starting
from initial surplus $u$, and $T = \inf{ (t ≥ 0 : R(t) &lt; 0)}$ is the time of ruin of risk model.</p>

<p>By conditioning on the time and the amount of the first claim, we derive that

<hr>

<p>Let $k\in(0,1)$ and the elliptic integrals $K, E$ are defined as follows: $$K(k)=\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\frac{dx}{\sqrt{1 - k^{2}\sin^{2}x}},\,E(k)=\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\sqrt{1-k^{2}\sin^{2}x}\,dx\tag{1}$$ The number $k$ is called the <em>modulus</em> and a complementary modulus $k'$ is defined by $k'=\sqrt{1-k^{2}}$ and if the value of $k$ is available from context then the integrals $K(k), E(k), K(k'), E(k') $ are generally denoted by $K, E, K', E'$.</p>

<p>If $n$ is a positive rational number then it can be proved that there is a unique modulus $k$ such that $K'/K=\sqrt{n} $ and moreover this $k$ is an algebraic number. Such values of $k$ are famous and are called <em>singular moduli</em> and one may denote them by $k_{n} $ corresponding to the rational number $n$. </p>

<p>Chowla and Selberg proved in <a href=""http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN243919689_0227&amp;DMDID=DMDLOG_0008"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this paper</a> that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Let $k$ be a singular modulus. Then the elliptic integrals $K(k), E(k) $ can be expressed in terms of Gamma values at rational points and $\pi$. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The linked paper of Chowla and Selberg uses theory of quadratic forms and related complex analytic techniques to prove their theorem. On the other hand Ramanujan knew the evaluation of $K$ in terms of Gamma values and $\pi$ for some singular moduli $k$. In his classic paper <em>Modular Equations and Approximations to $\pi$</em> he gave the evaluations for $n=1,2,3$ without proof. It is thus reasonable to assume that the evaluations are possible by remaining within the limits of real analysis methods at least for $n=1,2,3$. The case $n=1$ is covered in <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1793756/72031"">this answer</a>. </p>

This game is as follows: Player $A$ rolls the die $n=50$ times and player $B$ flips the coin $n=50$ times, after which player $A$ has collected $Y_A$ points and player B has collected $Y_B$ points. After $n=50$ trials: </p>

<p><strong>b)</strong> What is the probability that player $A$ and player $B$ together will have more than $340$ points? Use normal approximations.</p>

<p><strong>c)</strong> What is the probability that player $B$ will have exactly $225$ points? </p>

<hr>

<p>I have calculated the means/expected values to: mean($Y_A$) = 4,5 and mean($Y_B$) = 4,5, the variances I have calculated to: Var($Y_A$)=5,25 and Var($Y_B$)=12,25. </p>

<p>a) 
Following @callculus answer: 
I have in a table found Φ(.32) to be .6255. So 1 - 0.6255 = 0.3745, will that say that the probability for player A having at least 10 more points than player B is 37%</p>

<p>b) 
Following the method from a): 
$$P(Y_A + Y_B &gt; 340) = 1- P(Y_A + Y_B &gt;= 340) = 1 - Φ((340+0.5-450)/\sqrt{875}) \\= 1 - Φ(-3.7) = 1-0.00009 = 99.991\% \approx 100\%$$
There is almost 100% $P(Y_A+Y_B &gt; 340).$ </p>

<p>c)
Using the binomial PMF with $50$ trials and $25$ successes. </p>

<p>$$(50!)/((25!)*(50-25)! * 0.5^{25} * (1-0.5)^{50-25} = 0.112275173.$$ 
So $P(Y_B = 225) = 11\%.$ </p>

<p>EDIT: I would welcome some references. 
According to the question in the comments: the Lie algebra of the Lie group $G$ is defined as Lie algebra of left invariant vetor fields on $G$. Therefore for an infinite dimensional $G$ we would like to have a notion of a vector field. Vector fields are defined as section of the tangent bundle: the fibers of the tangent bundle are tangent spaces. We define the tangent space at a given point $x$ as the set of classes of smooth curves $\gamma:I \to G, \gamma(0)=x$ with equivalence relation $\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2$ iff for any chart $\varphi$ we have $\frac{d}{dt}(\varphi \circ \gamma_1)(0)=\frac{d}{dt}(\varphi \circ \gamma_2)(0)$. This set is in one to one correspondence with $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n$-dimensional manifolds and the linear structure is transported via this correspondence. In infinite dimension there are few delicate moments: instead $\mathbb{R}^n$ we need another ,,model space''. Which model space we choose for infinite dimensional Lie groups, in particular for $Diff(M)$?<br>
Moreover while defining tangent space we need derivative: which notion do we use?</p>

It is known that the set of real numbers has the same cardinality as the set of continuous $\R$ to $\R$ functions---and therefore a bijection exists between them. My question is whether a <strong>continuous</strong> bijection exists between them, or at least a continuous <em>surjection</em> from $\R$ to $C(\R)$, where $\R$ has the usual metric and $C(\R)$ has whatever metric works.</p>

<p>The reason this interests me is I have always felt that one of the reasons differential equations are hard to solve is because we don't have a big enough ""vocabulary"" to describe all of the functions in continuous function space. This is in contrast to the space of real numbers where we <em>do</em> have a robust method to express any real number to arbitrary precision: decimal notation. And historically, decimals have allowed us to solve many previously intractable problems like, say, computing cube roots---something the ancient Greeks could never do.</p>

<p>If a continuous surjection exists between real numbers and continuous functions, we could then use decimal notation to describe any continuous function to arbitrary precision, instead of being restricted to compositions of elementary functions or their extensions. We might even be able to express functional operations in terms of arithmetic operations. And maybe this could (but I'm only speculating) give us a way to solve difficult differential (or other functional) equations in much in the same way decimals allowed us to compute cube roots.</p>

<hr>

<p>But I'm going out on a limb now. Even if such a surjection exists, I have no idea how much it would actually help in solving such problems. But I'm very curious about that, so if anyone has any additional insights, please tell!

"2391769","2392545","What is the number of binary strings of length N with exactly R runs of ones, with C total ones?","<p>I'm concerned with the total number of ones, and the total number of runs, but not with the size of any of the runs.</p>

<p>For example, $N=8$, $R=3$, $C=5$ includes 11101010, 01101011 among the 24 total possible strings.</p>

<p>I can compute these for small $N$ easily enough, but I am specifically interested in the distribution for $N=65536$. As this will result in very large integers, the log probability distribution is equally useful.</p>

<p>I found [1] and [2], which includes this:</p>

<p>Let $N_{n;g_k,s_k}$ denote the number of binary strings which contain for given $g_k$ and $s_k$, $g_k=0,1,…,⌊\frac{s_k}{k}⌋$, $s_k=0,k,k+1,…,n$, exactly $g_k$ runs of 1’s of length at least $k$ with total number of 1’s (with sum of lengths of runs of 1’s) exactly equal to $s_k$ in all possible binary strings of length $n$.</p>

<p>An expression for this is given in eq. (24):</p>

<p>$N_{n;g_k,s_k} = \sum_{y=0}^{n-s_k}
{y+1 \choose g_k }
{s_k-(k-1)g_k-1 \choose g_k-1}
\sum_{j=0}^{⌊\frac{n-y-s_k}{k}⌋}
(-1)^j
{y+1-g_k \choose j}
{n-s_k-kj-g_k \choose n-s_k-kj-y}
$</p>

<p>for $g_k \in \{1, ..., ⌊\frac{s_k}{k}⌋\}$, $s_k \in \{k, k+1, ..., n\}$.</p>

<p>I think this is exactly what I'm looking for, with $k = 1$, $s_k = C$ and $g_k = R$. However, when I implemented this I did not get the expected results (Python shown below, edge cases omitted), based on comparing to counting all strings for N=8. I am working backwards to try to understand where I might have gone wrong, but not having much luck yet. I wonder if I am misunderstanding the result.</p>

<pre><code>def F(x, y, n):
    # x = C or s_k (cardinality)
    # y = R or g_k (runCount)
    # n = N (total bits)

    a1 = 0
    for z in range(n-x+1):
        b1 = choose(z+1, y) * choose(x-1, y-1)
        a2 = 0
        for j in range(n-z-x+1):
            a2 += (-1) ** j * choose(z+1-y, j) * choose(n-x-j-y, n-x-j-z)
        a1 += b1 * a2

    return a1
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>choose</code> function uses factorial, which I realize won't work for larger $N$ - but should be fine for $N=8$.</p>

<p>I can see that the Banach-Alaoglu theorem is being implicitly referenced, and I believe I understand the proof up to the last line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By approximation it follows easily that $\xi_n \to \xi$ weakly in
  $L^1$ along $N'$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My attempt to complete this last part of the proof goes like this: </p>

<p>Fix $\epsilon&gt;0$. Since $\eta_k\to\xi$ in $L^1$, for sufficiently large $k$ we have $E|\eta_k-\xi|&lt;\epsilon$. Also, by the uniform integrability of $\xi_n$, for sufficiently large $k$ we have $\sup_n E|\xi_n - \xi_n^k|&lt;\epsilon$. So, choose a $k$ such that both these inequalities hold. Then, for this choice of $k$, since $\xi_n^k \to \eta_k$ in $L^1$ as $n\to\infty$ along $N'$, there is an $M$ such that $E|\xi_n^k-\eta_k|&lt;\epsilon$ for $n \geq M$ in $N'$. Putting this together, we obtain
$$E|\xi_n-\xi| \leq E|\xi_n-\xi_n^k| + E|\xi_n^k-\eta_k| + E|\eta_k-\xi|
\leq 3\epsilon$$
for $n \geq M$ in $N'$. Since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary, this shows that $\xi_n\to \xi$ in $L^1$ along $N'$.</p>

<p>However, something seems to be wrong, since this proves too much. We should only be able to show weak convergence in $L^1$. Where is the mistake?</p>

"2391837","2394410","How to mathematically describe a whether an edge belongs to a geometric face","<p>No, it is not a human face. But rather, how can we mathematically describe if an edge, belongs to a face of a piece of geometry?</p>

<p>For example, let's say that you have a square within a square:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H20jf.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>How would you be able to describe that the edges displayed belong to the outer square instead of the inner square?</p>

<p>Edit:
This problem is assuming that the inner square is a hole.</p>

<p>Also, I am only dealing in 2D space. </p>

<p>This is only a simplification of an overall problem. I am currently working on an alvorithm that will be able to take a list of lines, nodes (or vertices), and arcs and convert them into a data structure that is recognizable to GMSH. I have my own line, arc, and node list and I need to convert it into a GModel (for those who are famalier with gmsh, I am essentially creating a .geo file using the c++ source directly).</p>

<p>The format is that I need to specify all of the nodes in the gmodel. The gmsh equilivant to a node is a Gvertex. Then, to create the lines, I need to specify which Gvertex is associated with the gline. This part will be relatively easy.</p>

<p>The hard part is specifing the GFace. Basically, a GFace is a collection of Glines. But the challenge is is how to specify or how to know which Gline belongs to which face. </p>

<p>For example, say we have 2 squares, how can you identify line 1 belongs to square 1 or square 2? </p>

<p>In this example, how can you identify that the outer square is the actual face verses the inner square which is a hole? And how can you know that the edges belong to that face?</p>

<p>Again, this is a simplification. The answer would need to apply to any geometry.</p>

<p>Here is a link to a picture with a more complicated geometry. I think that the example that I gave was an over simplification:</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/siZpH"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://imgur.com/a/siZpH</a></p>

<p>Edit 2:</p>

<p>Please forgive me. I am still developing my math terms and language. I am mostly a programmer. I will do my best to communicate my ideas to the users on the forum. Please though, if there is additional data that I need to clarify or need to say, let me know and I will happily edit this thread.</p>

<p>My geometry is composed of vertices which is a double of real numbers (x, y). This is only in 2-D. I am not doing anything with imaginary numbers or utilizing other graphs. This is 2-D Euclidean space. These vertices are stored in an array (or list or vector or whatever). There is no particular order to how the vertices are stored. </p>

<p>An edge is a pair of indices that is obtained from the vertex list. Ex. (2, 5) means that an edge is created between the 2nd and 5th node. For this, I consider arcs the same as edges but with information such as the arc angle, radius, and center of the arc.</p>

<p>Also, the edge list is in no particular order.</p>

<p>Basically, I need to generate a list of faces. A face will be defined by line loops which are an array of the edges that compose the face. The 0th index will be the outer most line. If there are any holes in the domain, then the proceeding indices in the array will be the holes. For the example of the square: lineLoop[0] = {1, 2, 3, 4}. The 1 is the first edge and the 2 is the second edge. (I didn't label the edges wih numbers but the numbering of the edges can start from any point as long as it is a counter clockwise direction). And lineLoop[1] = {5, 6, 7, 8}. At this point, lineLoop is able to describe the face effectively.</p>

I have the following expression $$ \langle \nabla_{E_i}E_j, E_l \rangle = \frac{1}{2}(E_i\langle E_j, E_l \rangle + E_j \langle E_l, E_i \rangle - E_l \langle E_i, E_j \rangle $$ $$ - \langle E_j, [E_i, E_l] \rangle - \langle E_l, [E_j, E_i] \rangle + \langle E_i, [E_l, E_j] \rangle) $$ which simplifies to $ \Gamma^k_{ij}\langle E_k, E_l \rangle $ where I think that $\langle E_k, E_l \rangle$ is equal to the identity matrix $I_2$, since $E_1$ and $E_2$ are $h$-orthonormal. This yields $$ \Gamma^k_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}I_2^{kl}(E_i\langle E_j, E_l \rangle + E_j \langle E_l, E_i \rangle - E_l \langle E_i, E_j \rangle $$ $$ - \langle E_j, [E_i, E_l] \rangle - \langle E_l, [E_j, E_i] \rangle + \langle E_i, [E_l, E_j] \rangle) $$ Given that $[E_1, E_2] = -v\partial_u = -[E_2, E_1] = v\partial_u$, we can calculate the Christoffel symbols. Here's one to verify that I am calculating correctly: $$\Gamma^2_{11} = \frac{1}{2}I^{2l}(E_1\langle E_1, E_l \rangle + E_1 \langle E_l, E_1 \rangle - E_l\langle E_1, E_1 \rangle  - \langle E_1, [E_1, E_l] \rangle - \langle E_l, [E_1, E_1]\rangle + \langle E_1, [E_l, E_1]\rangle) $$ for $l \neq 2$, all terms vanish, and for $l = 2$ the first three terms vanish, leaving $$\Gamma^2_{11} = \frac{1}{2}(-\langle E_1, [E_1, E_2]\rangle - \langle E_2, 0 \rangle + \langle E_1, [E_2, E_1] \rangle) = \frac{1}{2}(\langle E_1, -E_1 \rangle + \langle E_1, E_1 \rangle = 1 $$</p>

I want to show that $T(B_X)$ is compact, where $B_X$ is the closed unit ball in $X$. </p>

<p>I proceed like this.</p>

<p>We know that since $X$ is reflexive and $T$ is completely continuous, therefore $T$ is compact. Thus $\overline{T(B_X)}$ is compact. Thus it suffices to prove that $T(B_X)$ is closed. Consider a sequence $(Tx_n)$ in $T(B_X)$. Thus $(x_n)\subset B_X$ and so $(x_n)$ is a bounded sequence in $X$. Since $X$ is reflexive there exists a subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ of $(x_n)$ and there exists $x\in X$ such that $(x_{n_k})$ converges to $x$ weakly. Since $T$ is completely continuous, therefore $T(x_{n_k})\to T(x)$. Here is the problem. How to show that $x\in B_X$ so that $Tx\in T(B_X)$ and so $T(B_X)$ is closed? Please suggest.

<p>Reading a few other posts on here, I considered the possibility that the midrange $\frac{M-L}{2}$ is the MLE for $\theta.$ Of course, the difficulty arises out of the fact that there are many possibilities for $L$ and $M$: $m \geq \ell &gt; 0,$ $m \geq 0 &gt; \ell,$ and $0 \geq m &gt; \ell,$ to name a few. </p>

<p>Plugging $x = 0$ in   $16P(x^2) = P(2x)^2$ , we obtain $P(0) = 0$ or $16$</p>

<p>$(i)$, suppose $P(0) = 0$. Then $P(x) = xQ(x)$, for some Polynomial $Q$, hence
$16x^2Q(x^2) = 4x^2Q(2x)^2$, which reduces to $4Q(x^2) = Q(2x)^2$, setting $4Q(x) = R(x)$ for some Polynomial $R$, gives $16R(x^2) = R(2x)^2$ hence $P(x) = \frac {1}{4}xR(x)$, with R satisfying the same relation as $P$</p>

<p>I understand the above argument very well, but the argument presented below is what I do not understand at all.</p>

<p>$(ii)$, Suppose that $P(0) = 16$ putting $P(x) = xQ(x) + 16$ in the given relation, we obtain $4xQ(x^2) = xQ(2x)^2 + 16Q(2x)$. Hence $Q(0) = 0$, i.e. $Q(x) = xQ_1(x)$ for some Polynomial $Q_1$
Furthermore; $x^2Q(2x)^2 = x^2Q_1(2x)^2 + 8Q_1(2x)$, implying that $Q_1(0) = 0$ so $Q_1$ too is divisible by $x$, thus $Q(x) = x^2Q_1(x)$, now, suppose $x^n$ is the highest degree of $x$ dividing $Q_1$, and $Q(x) = x^nR(x)$, where $R(0) \ne 0$, then $R$ satisfies </p>

<p>$4x^{n-1}R(x^2) = 2^{2n}x^{n+1}R(2x)^2 + 2^{n+4}R(2x) . . (*)$ which implies that $R(0) = 0$, a contradiction, it follows that $Q(0) = 0$ and $R(x) = 16.</p>

<p>Sergei Ivanov (<a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/users/4354/sergei-ivanov"">https://mathoverflow.net/users/4354/sergei-ivanov</a>), Counterexample to Sard Theorem for a not-C1 map, URL (version: 2012-11-20): <a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/q/114000"">https://mathoverflow.net/q/114000</a></p>

<p>citing the answer:</p>

<p>""</p>

<p>No, such functions do not exist. More precisely, let $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ be an arbitrary function, $\Sigma$ is the set of $x\in\mathbb R$ such that $f'(x)$ exists and equals 0. Then $f(\Sigma)$ has measure 0.</p>

<p>By countable subadditivity of measure, we may assume that the domain of $f$ is $[0,1]$ rather that $\mathbb R$. Fix an $\varepsilon&gt;0$. For every $x\in\Sigma$ there exists a subinterval $I_x\ni x$ of $[0,1]$ such that $f(5I_x)$ is contained in an interval $J_x$ with  $m(J_x)&lt;\varepsilon m(I_x)$. Here $m$ denotes the Lebesgue measure and $5I_x$ the interval 5 times longer than $I_x$ with the same midpoint. Now by Vitali Covering Lemma there exists a countable collection $\{x_i\}$ such that the intervals $I_{x_i}$ are disjoint and the intervals $5I_{x_i}$ cover $\Sigma$. Since $I_{x_i}$ are disjoint, we have $\sum m(I_{x_i})\le 1$. Therefore $f(\Sigma)$ is covered by intervals $J_{x_i}$ whose total measure is no greater than $\varepsilon$. Since $\varepsilon$ is arbitrary, it follows that $f(\Sigma)$ has measure 0.</p>

<p>""</p>

<p>Now, I cannot see where one uses in the proof that the function is defined on the real line (as far as I saw, Vitali Covering Lemma is true not only for intervals, but also for balls in higher dimensions).</p>

<p>But it is known that there are functions from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}$, $n\geq 2$, which are even continuously differentiable, but which have the set of critical values not of measure 0:</p>

<p><a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/a/258145"">https://mathoverflow.net/a/258145</a> citing 
H. Whitney, A function not constant on a connected set of its critical points, Duke Math. J. 1 (1935), 514-517.</p>

<p>(cited also by Sard), and </p>

<p><a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/a/258147"">https://mathoverflow.net/a/258147</a></p>

<p>So why does not the cited proof generalize to functions from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}$, $n\geq 2$, and contradict the existence of such examples?</p>

"2392062","2392178","How to calculate $\iint_S F\cdot ndS$ over ellipsoid $S$ that is above $z=1$ and given vector field?","<blockquote>
  <p>Let $S$ be part of the ellipsoid $3x^2+2y^2+z^2=28$ that is above the plane $z=1$ and $F=\langle yz^2,4xz, zx^2\rangle$ a vector field. Calculate $\iint_S F\cdot ndS$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought of first ""closing"" the surface $S$ with the plane  $z=1$ and then calculating the integral with Gauss theorem (let the closed surface be $B$) and then calculating separately $\iint F\cdot ndS$ over the plane.</p>

<p>So:
$$
\iint_S F\cdot ndS=\iint_B F\cdot ndS-\iint_{z=1} F\cdot ndS
$$
Calculating $\iint_{z=1} F\cdot ndS$ is relatively easy. The projection (let is be $P$) of $S$ onto the plane is $3x^2+2y^2+1^2=28\iff x^2+y^2=9$, then:
$$
0\le r\le 3\\
0\le \theta\le2\pi\\
n=\langle 0,0,1\rangle\text{  (the normal vector to the projection is essentially the negative axis z)}
$$
Then:
$$
\iint_{P} F\cdot ndS=\iint_P zx^2 dA\stackrel{z=1}{=}\iint_P x^2 dA\stackrel{\text{in polar coord.}}{=}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^3 r^3\cos^2\theta=\frac{81}{4}\pi.
$$

<p>Calculation of $\iint_B F\cdot ndS$ is much more problematic. According to Gauss theorem:
$$
\iint_B F\cdot ndS=\iiint_G\operatorname{div}F \,dv\\
\operatorname{div}F=x^2\implies \iiint_G x^2 \,dv
$$
I thought that we can do the calculation in polar coordinates again:
$$
0\le r\le 3\\
0\le \theta\le2\pi\\
1\le z\le\sqrt{28-3(x^2+y^2)}
$$
Thus:
$$
\iiint_{1}^{\sqrt{28-3r^2}} r^2\cos^2\theta\cdot r 
$$
Very quickly the integral turns ugly but manageable:
$$
\int \cos^2\theta\int \bigg[\frac{r^4}{4}\bigg]^{\sqrt{28-3r^2}}_1=\frac{1}{4}\int \cos^2\theta\int (28-3r^2)^2-1=\\\frac{1}{4}\int \cos^2\theta\int 2862-168r^2+r^4-1=\big(462+\frac{243}{20}-\frac{3}{16}\big)\pi.
$$
So the final answer is:
$$
\iint_S F\cdot ndS=\big(462+\frac{243}{20}-\frac{3}{16}\big)\pi-\frac{81}{4}\pi.
$$
Am I in the right direction?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What I have done so far</strong>:</p>
  
  <p>I tried induction on the number of elements in a linear combination: 
  if $\lambda_1f_1(x) = 0$ for all $x \in A$ then obviously $\lambda_1 = 0$ if we put $x = 1$. Now, let this statement be true for any $n$ ring homomorphisms. Let $$0 = \sum_{i = 1}^{n+1} \lambda_if_i(x)$$ Then we have for all $i = 1,...,n+1$ that $\lambda_i \neq 0$ (otherwise we would have a linear combination with strictly less than $n+1$ terms and could apply induction hypothesis) and 
  $$\lambda_if_i(x) = -\sum_{\stackrel{j = 1}{j \neq i}}^{n+1} \lambda_j f_j(x)$$
  (From this it is easy to see that $\ker f_k = \ker f_l$ since B is an integral domain, but I don't know if it has any use). If for some $i$ we have that $\lambda_i$ is not a unit, then we can pick some proper maximal ideal $L \unlhd B$ such that $\lambda_iB \subset L$ and compose this equation with the projection $\pi : B \to B/L$
  $$0 = -\sum_{\stackrel{j = 1}{j \neq i}}^{n+1} \pi(\lambda_j) (\pi \circ f_j)(x)$$ Since $B/L$ is also an integral domain, I would like to apply the induction hypothesis on the set $\{\pi \circ f_1,..., \pi \circ f_{n+1}\}\setminus\{\pi \circ f_i\}$, but I don't know if it leads me anywhere since $\pi(\lambda_j) = 0$ does not imply $\lambda_j = 0$.</p>

"2392198","2392208","Smooth continuation of a real function","<p>Somehow I always knew we could continue a smooth real function to a larger domain uniquely. I can't seem to find such a result however and I am probably confusing it with the analytic continuation of a complex function. Thinking about this I am growing more and more convinced that the smooth continuation of a real function is not unique. For example I think I vaguely recall that in functional analysis we could construct multiple different functions, all of which had some desired asymptotic properties at infinity. Of course this is just on the level of intuition, but it seems to contradict the uniqueness of the continuation. Anyway, better to ask and be sure, so I should do this (somewhat) clearly...</p>

<p>Given intervals $A\subset B\subset\mathbb{R}$ and a smooth function $f:A\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$, can we find a smooth function $g:B\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$, such that $g$ is unique and $g|_A=f$?</p>

"2392203","2394472","Metric Spaces: Explore the relationship between $\partial_P S$ and $\partial_{X_{i}} \pi_i(S)$ for $i \in \mathbb N_n.$","<p>Suppose $n \in \mathbb N$ and, for each $i \in  \mathbb N_n$, $(X_i, \tau_i)$ is a non-empty metric space. Suppose $d$ is a conserving metric on $P = \prod_{i=1}^n X_i$. Suppose
$S \subseteq P$. Explore the relationship between $\partial_P S$ and $\partial_{X_i} \pi_i(S)$ for $i ∈ \mathbb  N_n.$</p>

<p>Note that $\partial_P S$ refers to the boundary of $S$ in $P$. $\pi_i(S)$ refers to the $i$th natural projection of $S$ into $X_i$.
$\prod_{i=1}^n X_i$ refers to the product tupple.</p>

<p><strong>The definition of a conserving metric is attached at the bottom</strong></p>

<p><strong>Attempt:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>$\partial_P S= \{x \in P \mid dist(x,S)=0=dist(x, S^C) \} \qquad \qquad(1)$.</p>
    
    <p>$\partial_{X_i} \pi_i(S) = \{x_i \in X_i \mid dist(~x_i, ~\pi_i(S)~)=0=dist(~x_i, ~\pi_i^c(S)~)\} \qquad \qquad  (2)$.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, since $d$ is conserving : </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>$\max \{\tau_i(a_i,b_i) \mid i \in N_n \} \le d(a,b) \le \sum_{i=1}^n \tau_i(a_i,b_i) \qquad \qquad (3)$</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>By definition: $dist (x,S)= \inf \{d(x,s) \mid s \in S\}$. Therefore, by the definition of infimum, we have, </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>$\forall~ r &gt;0, \exists \ s_r \in S \mid d(x,s_r)&lt;dist (x,S)+r \qquad\qquad\qquad(4)$</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, suppose $x \in \partial_P S$. Then, $x$ satisfies $(1)$.
Then, due to inequality $(3)$ and $(4)$, we have : </p>

<p>$~\tau_i(x_i, ~\pi_i~(S)~)=0=~\tau_i(x_i, ~\pi_i^c~(S)~) \qquad \forall \ i \in  \mathbb N_n$</p>

<p>This clearly means that whenever $x$ belongs to $\partial_P S,$ then $x_i ~\in~ \partial_{X_i} \pi_i(S) \quad \forall~ i\in N_n$.</p>

<p>Similarly, we can prove the other way around as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>However, my textbook Metric Spaces by Michael Searcoid presents the solution as below.

<p>It is clear that $x_n$ is increasing, so it has to have a limit. I tried to prove the limit is $+\infty$ but without success. No divergence criteria from series seems to work here.</p>

<p>Attempt: 
Suppose a stronger inequality holds, namely that, for every $n\ge1$, $$\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\geqslant1-\frac1n \tag 1$$ Then:
$$\frac {a_3}{a_2} \ge \frac 1 2\qquad
\frac {a_4}{a_3} \ge \frac 2 3\qquad
\ldots\qquad
\frac {a_{n-1}}{a_{n-2}} \ge \frac {n-3}{n-2}\qquad
\frac {a_n}{a_{n-1}} \ge \frac {n-2}{n-1}$$
Multiplying all the above yields
$$\frac {a_n}{a_2} \ge \frac 1 {n-1}$$
The last inequality proves the divergence.</p>

<p>Assume $(a_n)$ is a bounded sequence. 
Prove:$[\text{Every convergent subsequence of }(a_n)\text{ converges to }a]\implies[\lim a_n=a]$</p>

<p><strong>Step 0:</strong> We decide we'll prove the contrapositive, so the problem is now:</p>

<p>Assume $(a_n)$ is a bounded sequence. Prove:
$[\lim a_n\ne a]\implies[\text{There exists a convergent subsequence of }(a_n)\text{ that does not converge to }a ]$</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> $\lim a_n\ne a\implies\exists\ \epsilon_{0}&gt;0:|a_n-a|\ge \epsilon_{0}\ \forall\ n\in\mathbb{N}$</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> $(a_n)$ is bounded $\implies$ $(a_n)$ has a convergent subsequence. Call this convergent subsequence $(a_{n_{k}})$. </p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The only things we know about $(a_{n_{k}})$ are that A) it converges to something and B) it's a subsequence of $(a_n)$. I think the only task left is to show $(a_{n_{k}})$ cannot converge specifically to $a$. </p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To show $(a_{n_{k}})$ does not converge to $a$,  we must show $\exists\ \epsilon_{1}&gt;0:|a_{n_{k}}-a|\ge\epsilon_{1}\ \forall\ k\in\mathbb{N}$. </p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> $(a_{n_{k}})$ is a subsequence of $(a_n)$ $\implies$ All the terms of $(a_{n_{k}})$ come from $(a_{n})$. Since all terms of $(a_{n})$ are at least $\epsilon_{0}$ away from  $a$, then so are all terms of $(a_{n_{k}})$.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Let $\epsilon_{1}=\epsilon_{0}$. Then we have found an $\epsilon_{1}$ such that $|a_{n_{k}}-a|\ge \epsilon_{1}\ \forall\ k\in\mathbb{N}$.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> $(a_{n_{k}})$ is a convergent subsequence of $(a_{n})$ (step 2) that does not converge to $a$ (steps 4-6). So we've found a convergent subsequence of $(a_{n})$ that doesn't converge to $a$.</p>

<p>I wrote this in these steps so it's easier to point out where I'm wrong. I don't understand why every solution I read (that doesn't involve limit superior) requires a sub-subsequence.

  <p>There are $k + 1$ coins in a box. When flipped, the ith coin will turn up heads with probability $i/k, i = 0, 1, . . . , k$. A coin is randomly selected from the box and is then repeatedly flipped. If the first n flips all result in heads, what is the conditional probability that the $(n + 1)$st flip will do likewise?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Solution is given as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $C_i$ denote the event that the $i$th coin, $i = 0, 1, . . . , k$, is initially selected; let $F_n$ denote the event that the first $n$ flips all result in heads; and let $H$ be the event that the $(n + 1)$st flip is a head. The desired probability, $P(H|F_n)$, is now obtained as follows:
  $$P(H|F_n) = \sum^k_{i=0} P(H|F_nC_i)P(C_i|F_n)$$
  Now, given that the ith coin is selected, it is reasonable to assume that the outcomes will be conditionally independent, with each one resulting in a head with probability $i/k$. Hence,
  $$P(H|F_nC_i) = P(H|C_i) = \frac{i}{k}$$

<p>$x=2n, n \in \mathbb{N}$</p>

<p>$\Rightarrow x^2 = 4n^2$</p>

<p>$\Rightarrow x^2$ is even</p>

<p>$\Rightarrow \lnot Even(x^2) \rightarrow \lnot Even(x)$</p>

<p>Now the Law of the excluded middle:</p>

<p>$\Rightarrow Odd(x^2) \rightarrow Odd(x)$</p>

<p>So reasonably straight forward. However, my issue with this is whilst $x^2$ is even, it is even more strictly defined as a multiple of $4$. So in the contrapositive sense it doesn't feel right that it can be any even number. So what happens if that said number is 6? Not strictly divisible by 4 but still even. This is a bit difficult because this proof's conclusion is actually correct and any squared integer is either divible by 4 or odd. But that was found through exhaustion in a different way. Using the law of the excluded middle after saying that it wasn't just any even number seems spurious.</p>

<p>Could someone please clarify if I am right with reservation about this? If not, please explain (without just saying it is contrapositive, therefore). I feel like there should be a continuing connection between the definition of what type of even and what can be deduced from that.</p>

<p>I am following some (very old) notes where this PDE is solved numerically using finite difference methods. They start by ""recasting the wave equation in first-order form (first order in time, first order in space)"".</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why does the single equation $\phi_{tt}(x,t)=\phi_{xx}(x,t)$ turn into two equations $\psi_t(x,t)=\rho_x(x,t)$ and $\rho_t(x,t)=\psi_x(x,t)$ after introducing the auxiliary variables? To be more specific, where does the equation $\psi_t(x,t)=\rho_x(x,t)$ come from?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do the 2 boundary conditions become 4 boundary conditions? How are the new boundary conditions derived?

My intuition is that a vector $v\in V$ <em>must</em> be ""glued"" to the origin, since the origin is the only canonical thing that $V$ has (not even the basis is canonical, and I suspect the origin (aka. the zero vector) is the only vector that has the same representation under every basis).</p>

<p>But, in many contexts, vectors are not thought of as being ""glued"" to the origin, in particular when we think of them as ""displacements"": a ""displacement vector"" from $a$ to $b$ can be the same as a displacement vector from $c$ to $d$ under suitable conditions. (Intuitively, a ""displacement vector"" can be moved around <em>without</em> making it a different vector.)</p>

<p>In stark contrast, a ""position"" in Euclidean space <em>cannot</em> be moved around without making it a different position, since a position is only equal to itself and no other position.</p>

<p>So ""displacements"" and ""positions"" can be written as vectors, but clearly they don't behave the same.</p>

<p>In calculus texts, authors usually switch back and forth between vectors that are ""glued"" to the origin, and vectors that are ""not glued"" to the origin. But I find that this obscures the nature of what a vector is, and I'd like a rigorous distinction.</p>

<p>Spivak's <em>A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry, Volume I</em> (Chapter 3: The tangent bundle) suggests that the appropriate language is that of <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle"" rel=""noreferrer"">tangent bundles</a></strong>.

If we let $x$ vary over $\mathbb{R}^n$, I suppose the set of all tangent spaces would be the set $\{(x,\mathbb{R}^n) \ | \ x\in\mathbb{R}^n\}$, which looks suspiciously like $\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n$, ie. $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.</p>

<p>Now a ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(vector)"" rel=""noreferrer"">position vector</a>"" seems to be a vector in the original ${\mathbb R}^n$, and a ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"" rel=""noreferrer"">displacement vector</a>"" starting at $x \in {\mathbb R}^n$ seems to be a vector in the tangent space $(x, {\mathbb R}^n)$. Then a vector space <em>always</em> has an origin, and a vector is always ""glued"" to that origin. What allows us to ""move vectors around"" with impunity is that ${\mathbb R}^n$ is isomorphic to ${\mathbb R}^n$.</p>

<p>Moreover, a motivation for tangent spaces seems to be precisely to formalize the idea of ""displacements"" on a manifold. How this is related to the idea of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space"" rel=""noreferrer"">affine spaces</a> (which also seem to deal with ""displacements""), I don't know.</p>

<hr>

<ol>
<li>Is any part of the above discussion correct?</li>
<li>When is a vector ""glued"" to the origin?</li>
<li>What is a rigorous formulation of ""position vectors"" and ""displacements vectors""? Does it use tangent bundles? Does it use affine spaces?</li>

All that we know for sure is that the coefficients must be rational ... We can write $P(x)=(3x-2)S(x)$, where $S(x)= \dfrac {Q(x)}{3}$.

If possible let rank$A &lt;$ rank$A|b $, ie. rank $A'&lt;$ rank$A'|b'$. Then there exists a row of $A'|b $ has nonzero 1 at the last column.

"2392634","2392677","Understanding probability in Updating information sequentially","<p>I am reading book ""First course in Probability"" by Sheldon Ross.</p>

<p>Under example with title ""Updating information sequentially"", he says following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question</strong><br>
  Suppose there are $n$ mutually exclusive and exhaustive possible hypotheses, with initial (sometimes referred to as prior) probabilities $P(H_i), \sum_{i=1}^n=1$. Now, if information that the event $E$ has occurred is received, then the conditional probability that $H_i$ is the true hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the updated or posterior probability of $H_i$) is 
  $$P(H_i|E)=\frac{P(E|H_i)P(H_i)}{\sum_jP(E|H_j)P(H_j)}   ...Equation(I)$$
  If the information that events $E_1$ and $E_2$ occurred is received, then the conditional probability is given as:
  $$P(H_i|E_1E_2)=\frac{P(E_1E_2|H_i)P(H_i)}{\sum_jP(E_1E_2|H_j)P(H_j)}$$
  One might wonder, however, when one can compute $P(H_i|E_1E_2)$ by using the
  right side of Equation $(I)$ with $E=E_2$ and with $P(H_j)$ replaced by $P(H_j|E_1)$, $j = 1, . . . , n$. That is, when is it legitimate to regard $P(H_j|E_1), j&gt;=1$, as the prior probabilities and then use equation $(I)$ to compute the posterior probabilities?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In solution, the author says following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Solution</strong>  </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>The answer is that the preceding is legitimate, provided that, for each j =
  1, . . . , n, the events E1 and E2 are conditionally independent</p></li>
  <li><p>Author then proves: $$P(H_i|E_1E_2)=\frac{P(E_2|H_i)P(H_i|E_1)}{\sum_{i=1}^nP(E_2|H_i)P(H_i|E_1)}$$</p></li>
  <li><p>Finally author concludes the solution as follows:
  For instance, suppose that one of two coins is chosen to be flipped. Let $H_i$ be the event that coin $i$, $i = 1, 2,$ is chosen, and suppose that when coin $i$ is flipped, it lands on heads with probability $p_i, i = 1, 2$. Then the preceding equations show that, to sequentially update the probability that coin 1 is the one being flipped, given the results of the previous flips, all that must be saved after each new flip is the conditional probability that coin 1 is the coin being used. That is, it is not necessary to keep track of all earlier
  results.</p></li>
  </ol>

<p>I am really struggling to wrap my head around this as I am not able to make much sense out of this. Also I am struggling to form any concrete question to ask here. But still I have formed some to help me make it some sense. But anyways any general more clear explanation is welcome. So the questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The last sentence in the question start with ""That is,"". How the last two sentences of the question equivalent? That is, how putting $E=E_2$ and $P(H_j)=P(H_j|E_1)$ means $P(H_j|E_1)$ is the prior probability and $E_2$ is the posterior probabilities?</li>
<li>Does the last two sentences in the question starting with ""One might wonder,..."" mean to say $P(H_i|E_1E_2)=P(E_2|H_iE_1)$</li>
<li>How does the title ""Updating information sequentially"" makes sense?</li>
<li>How does the last/third point in the solution makes sense?</li>

"2392712","2393119","Proof of weak maximum principle for heat equation","<p>I am having trouble with the last step of the proof of the weak maximum principle for the heat equation, as found in </p>

<p>th. 2.4 pp. 36-38.</p>

<p>Here is a sketch of the proof.</p>

<p>Let $w_t - D\Delta w = q \leq 0$ on the <em>space-time cylinder</em> $Q_T$ with <em>parabolic boundary</em> $\partial_p Q_T$ 
and let $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; T$.</p>

<p>Defining the auxiliary function $u = w - \varepsilon t \leq w$, we have
$$u_t - D\Delta u = q-\varepsilon &lt; 0$$ 
and we prove that 
$$ \max_{\overline{Q}_{T-\varepsilon}} u = \max_{\partial_p Q_{T-\varepsilon}} u$$
by a calculus argument: the Hessian is negative semidefinite and the time derivative is non-negative at the maximum, leading to a contradiction.</p>

<p>Moreover we prove that
$$ \max_{\overline{Q}_{T-\varepsilon}} w \leq \max_{\partial_p Q_T} w +\varepsilon T $$
essentially by subset properties w.r.t. maxima and the definition of $u$.</p>

<p><em>So far, so good</em>.</p>

<p>Here comes the tricky part, at least for me. It goes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since $w$ is continuous in $\overline{Q}_{T-\varepsilon}$ we deduce that
  $$ \max_{\overline{Q}_{T-\varepsilon}} w \to \max_{\overline{Q}_T} w \quad\text{as}\; \varepsilon\to 0 $$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>therefore in the limit above we get 
$$ \max_{\overline{Q}_T} w \leq \max_{\partial_p Q_T} w $$
which concludes the proof since the opposite inequality is true for subsets.</p>

<p>My comments</p>

<ul>
<li>$w$ is not only continuous, but also uniformly continuous on the compact 
$\overline{Q}_T$ and all its subsets, by Heine-Cantor theorem, but I cannot figure out how to use this property with the maxima.</li>
<li><p>I have also explored the possibility that they meant 'uniformly <em>convergent</em>' instead of 'continuous', but this seems only applicable to other proof strategies, in which only $ \overline{Q}_T $ and not $ \overline{Q}_{T-\varepsilon} $ is used, like for instance in <em>Evans</em> (1998) ch. 7 th. 8. 
For that line of reasoning, I am having trouble applying the triangle inequality to prove that 
$$ \max_{\overline{Q}_T} u \to \max_{\overline{Q}_T} w \quad\text{as}\; \varepsilon\to 0  $$
although this is slightly off topic.</p></li>
<li><p>For $\varepsilon\to 0$ the sets $\overline{Q}_{T-\varepsilon}$ are increasing, therefore we can build a corresponding sequence of maxima which is increasing and so converges to its supremum over $\varepsilon$, but here again how can I prove that 
$$ \sup_{\varepsilon&gt;0} \max_{\overline{Q}_{T-\varepsilon}} w = \max_{\overline{Q}_T} w$$</p></li>
</ul>

I'm suggested that we should use Girsanov's Theorem, but I am wondering if it works:</p>

<p>Let $Z_t=e ^ {\int_{0}^{t}B_s\mathrm dB_s - \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{t}B^2_s\mathrm ds  }$, then $E[Z_T]=1$. Let $\mathscr{F}_t=\sigma(B_t,0\leq t \leq T)$, then we can introduce a new measure $\tilde{P}$ by defining as follow:
$$
\tilde P(A)=\int_{A}Z_T\mathrm dP, \forall A\in \mathscr{F}_T
$$
Obviously $\tilde P$ is also a probability over $\mathscr{F}_T$. Thus $E^{\tilde P}[X]=E^P[XZ_t]$ for $X\in \mathscr{F}_t$.</p>

<p>Then by Girsanov's Theorem, $\tilde{B}_t=B_t-\int_{0}^{t}B_s\mathrm ds$ is a standard Brownian motion under $\tilde P$. Thus we have:
$$\begin{align*}
E^P\left[ e ^ { B_t + \int_{0}^{t}B_s\mathrm dB_s - \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{t}B^2_s\mathrm ds  } \right] &amp;= E^P[e^{B_t}Z_t] 
\\&amp;=E^{\tilde P}[e^{B_t}]\\
&amp;=E^{\tilde P}[e^{\tilde B_t+\int_{0}^{t}B_s\mathrm ds}]
\end{align*}$$
Then I don't know what to do next. Is it possible to use Girsanov's Theorem here? Or is there a probabilistic way or pde way to solve this?

<p>If every neighborhood space of a space $X$ is homeomorphic, is $X$ homogeneous?</p>

<p>A direct proof of this might take the given neighborhood space homeomorphism taking a point $a$ to $b$ and paste to it additional neighborhood space homeomorphisms until the full space is covered, giving us a homeomorphism taking $a$ to $b$. For this to work we'd need to find neighborhood space homeomorphisms which agree on the intersection of (some of) their neighborhoods but I'm missing any simple way to do this. A proof by contradiction might proceed by supposing that $X$ is not homogeneous and so there are $a$ and $b$ such that there is no homeomorphism taking $a$ to $b$. Then the neighborhood space homeomorphism $\phi_{ab} : N(a) \to N(b)$ is a bijection of $X$ and so, without loss of generality by interchanging $a$ and $b$, there must exist some open $V$ of $X$ such that $\phi_{ab}^{-1}(V)$ is not open in $X$. If $V$ could be guaranteed to contain $b$ then we would be done but I'm missing a simple reason for why this should happen.</p>

<p>1-transitivity is often marketed as meaning ""the thing is the same at every point"", but in this case a statement which to me seems more closely aligned with this idea might not be equivalent to it.

The original integral to be evaluated is:</p>

<p>$$ k_n(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = 2 \int_{\mathbb{R}^m} \mathbf{dw} \frac{e^{- \Vert \mathbf{w} \Vert^2/2}}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} \Theta(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})\Theta(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{y})(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})^n (\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{y})^n $$</p>

<p>where $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^m  $ and $\Theta$ is the heaviside (step) function. They provide the result in the main text:</p>

<p>$$ k_n(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \frac{1}{\pi} \Vert \mathbf{x} \Vert^n \Vert \mathbf{y} \Vert^n J_n(\theta),$$ with
$$ \theta = \cos^{-1}\Big( \frac{\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y}}{ \Vert \mathbf{x} \Vert \Vert \mathbf{y} \Vert} \Big),\\

<p>In the supplemental material they explain how the integral was evaluated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this appendix, we show how to evaluate the multidimensional integral in eq. (1) for the arc-cosine
  kernel. Let $\theta$ denote the angle between the inputs $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$. Without loss of generality, we can take $\mathbf{x}$
  to lie along the $w_1$ axis and y to lie in the $w_1w_2$ -plane. Integrating out the orthogonal coordinates
  of the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$, we obtain the result in eq. (3) where $J_n(\theta)$ is the remaining integral:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>$$ J_n(\theta)=\int dw_1dw_2e^{-0.5(w_1^2+w_2^2)}\Theta(w_1)\Theta(w_1\cos\theta+w_2\sin\theta)w_1^n(w_1\cos\theta+w_2\sin\theta)^n.$$</p>

<p>How does one interpret the quoted text geometrically? I'm having trouble understanding how $m$ dimensions can be reduced down to $2$ without loss of generality. Furthermore, what are $w_1$ and $w_2$? The authors do not explicitly describe their meaning. Can the integral simplification be explained in terms of a substitution (e.g. something like $\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{w}=\Vert\mathbf{w}\Vert\Vert\mathbf{x}\Vert\cos(\theta_{wx})=w_1$)?</p>

If I assumed that $G/S$ is finitely generated then I could use the classification theorem for abelian groups and argue that $G/S$ is the direct product of some finite number of cyclic groups of order at most $n$, which would imply $G/S$ is finite.
<br>
If $G/S$ is not finitely generated then I have no idea how else to proceed. A direct proof is equally hard since I have little experience with infinite groups. Maybe I am missing something, any hints or ideas are appreciated.</p>

Let $\bar{k}$ be the algebraic closure of a field $k$, and $A$ a finite dimensional $k$-algebra.

$$

So $r$ is the number of non-unique occurrences. If $r=0$ we get permutations, which are $n!$ in number. If $r=1$, we get $n$ choices for a repeated digit, then $n+1\choose 2$ choices to place two non-unique digits, and then $(n-1)!$ choices for the remaining unique digits, totaling in $n {n+1\choose 2} (n-1)!={n+1\choose 2} n!$ arrangements. However, when $r$ grows we have many shapes for repeated digits, corresponding to partitions of $r$, and the formulas seem intimidating. </p>

<p>Another way to describe this class of arrangements, is to call them permutations with unspecified repetitions, i.e. we have all digits present, the order matters, but we are not given which digits repeat. The strings of digits having these properties are sometimes called 'pandigital numbers' (except that they don't allow $0$ in the first position).</p>

<p><strong>Question: is there a nice closed formula for the number of such class of arrangements?</strong></p>

<p>UPDATE:
User ""Especially Lime"" has provided a nice answer using inclusion-exclusion principle (and I accepted his answer). It turned out that his formula simplifies to 
$$
n! S(n+r,n)

where $S(n,m)$ is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_numbers_of_the_second_kind"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Stirling number of the second kind</a>, measuring the number of ways to partition an $n$-element set into $m$ nonempty subsets. Now it is obvious how to obtain this number from the very beginning: the shapes describing which positions among places $1,2,\dots,n+r$ are unique and which repeat, define a partition of the $n+r$-element set into $n$ nonempty subsets. Acting by $n!$ permutations by renumbering labels on parts yields the result.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: The closest I have come so far</strong> is to expand the space to double number of states and allowing elements > 1. Let us call the $N\times N$ probability transition matrix $\bf P$, then assuming $\bf P$ nonsingular we can calculate ${\bf P}^{-1}$, build the new matrices : </p>

$$ \delta(X,Y) = \sup_{\alpha, \beta} \{| P(X = \alpha \text{ and } Y = \beta) - P(X = \alpha)P(Y = \beta)| .\} $$<br>
Where $\alpha$ stands for the possible values of $X$ and $\beta$ stands for all possible values of $Y$.<br>
Assume it is known that $X,Y \in [0,1]$. Is it true that $|\text{Cov}(X,Y)| \leq \delta(X,Y)$?<br>
I tried to prove it ""step by step"". Clearly for independent random variables, both measures are $0$ so the condition holds. In addition,<br>
$$ |\text{Cov}(X,Y)| = | \sum_{\alpha, \beta} \alpha \beta P(X= \alpha, Y = \beta) - \sum_{\alpha}\alpha P(X=\alpha) \sum_{\beta} \beta P(Y=\beta) |$$ 
And since $P(X= \alpha, Y = \beta) \leq \sup_{\alpha ', \beta '} P(\alpha ', \beta ') $ I thought to plug it in into the sum, and get the bound - but I cannot get rid of the $\alpha, \beta$. I thought that maybe because we know that $\alpha, \beta \leq 1$ it is possible to bound it, but I didn't find how. Any help will be appreciated</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Because $$\operatorname{curl}F=\langle xe^{xy}\cos z,xy−ye^{xy}\cos z,1-xz\rangle$$
it looks like a nightmare to calculate $\iint \operatorname{curl}F\cdot ndS$ directly.</p>

<p>So I thought we can define a new field $G=\operatorname{curl}F$. Also let $S$ be the surface of semi-sphere and $B$ be the surface which closes the semi-sphere from the bottom.</p>

<p>Then $$\iint_S \operatorname{curl}F\cdot ndS=\iint_{S\cup B} \operatorname{curl}F\cdot ndS-\iint_B \operatorname{curl}F\cdot ndS\stackrel{\text{by Gauss theorem}}{=}\\
=\iiint_{S\cup B}\operatorname{div}(\operatorname{curl}F)-\iint_B \operatorname{curl}F\cdot ndS$$
Because $\operatorname{div}(\operatorname{curl}F)=0$ always then we just need to calculate the integral over $B$ and it's much easier because the normal unit vector is essentially the $z$ axis in the negative direction.
$$
\iint_{B} \operatorname{curl}F\cdot ndS=\iint_{ B} \operatorname{curl}F\cdot \langle0,0,-1\rangle dS=\iint_{B} (xz-1) dS\\
\stackrel{\text{z=0}}{=}\iint_{B}-1 dS\stackrel{\text{circle area}}{=}-\pi
$$
Thus:
$$
\iint_S \operatorname{curl}F\cdot ndS=\pi.

Is this in the right direction? I'm particularly not sure if $\operatorname{div}(\operatorname{curl}F)=0$ in this case.</p>

<p>(b) Now, the orthogonal complement of the directrix $W$ is another trivial subspace, $W^{\bot} = \Bbb{R}^4$. If $x \in W$, $y \in W^{\bot}$ and $\alpha,  \beta \in \Bbb{R}$ are such that $(1, 0, 0, 1) = \alpha x + \beta y$, than we have:
$$(1, 0, 0, 1) = \alpha (0, 0, 0, 0) + \beta (x_1, x_2, x_3, x-4).$$
Now, $\beta$ must be different form $0$, becuase otherwise will be $(1, 0, 0, 1) \neq \alpha x + \beta y$.
From there we can see that orthogonal projection of $(1, 0, 0, 1)$ on $W$ is null-vector.</p>

"2393190","2393204","Counting graded dimension of polynomial ring","<p>The polynomial ring $k[x,y]$ has graded $k$-dimension (aka. Poincaré-series) $\frac{1}{(1-q)^2}$. This is clear since the polynomial ring in one indeterminate has $\dim_q k[x]=1+q+q^2+\cdots=\frac{1}{1-q}$ the harmonic series.</p>

<p>Now I may regard $k[x,y]$ as the quotient $k\langle x,y\rangle/(xy-yx)$ of the free (non-commutative) algebra on two generators by the ideal encoding commutativity. I want to use this approach to compute $\dim_q k[x,y]$.</p>

<p>In $R:=k\langle x,y\rangle$, I have $2^l$ possibilities two form a monomial of degree $l$ from $x$ and $y$. Thus $k\langle x,y\rangle$ has graded dimension $d:= \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2q)^{l}=\frac{1}{1-2q}$. The (two-sided) ideal $R(xy-yx)R$ has dimension $q^2d^2$. The quotient thus should have graded dimension
$$\frac{1}{1-2q}\Big(1-\frac{q^2}{1-2q}\Big) = \frac{1-2q-q^2}{(1-2q)^2}. $$
This does not equal $\frac{1}{(1-q)^2}$.</p>

$f(x)-f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=\frac{3x^2}{4}+x$..........................$(2)$</p>

<p>$f(x)=f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+\frac{3x^2}{4}+x=f\left(\frac{x}{4}\right)+\left(\frac{3}{4}\frac{x^2}{2^2}\right)+3\frac{x^2}{4} +x .......$.(Using (2) and putting $\frac{x}{2}$ in place of $x$)</p>

<p>$=f\left(\frac{x}{4}\right)+\frac{3}{4}\left(x^2+\frac{x^2}{2^2}\right)+ \left(x+\frac{x}{2}\right)=f\left(\frac{x}{8}\right)+\frac{3}{4}\left(x^2+\frac{x^2}{2^2}+\frac{x^3}{2^3}\right)+\left(x+\frac{x}{2}+\frac{x}{4}\right)$</p>

<p>Continuing this way, for an infinitely large positive no. $n$ we have
$f(x)=f\left(\frac{x}{2^n}\right)+\frac{3}{4}x^2\left(1+\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{2^4}+..........+\frac{1}{2^{2n-2}}\right)+x\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2^2}+...............+\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\right)$</p>

<p>Now , putting $x=3$ in the last eqn. and considering $n\to \infty$ , $$f\left(\frac{x}{2^n}\right)\to f(0)=1$$Assuming the two sums in the R.H.S. of $(A)$ as infinite G.P. (Am I correct here ?)
$$f(3)=f(0)+\frac{3}{4}.3^2\left(1+\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{2^4}+.........\right)+3.\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2^2}+.............\right)=1+\frac{27}{4}.\frac{4}{3}+3.2=1+9+6=16$$</p>

$$
u=x-\frac{y}{2}\\

Then we'd get $u^2+v^2=1$. This is a circle so its area is $\pi$. I guess we just need to multiply it by the Jacobian $J$ which is:
$$
\frac{1}{J}=\begin{bmatrix}

"2393486","2393752","Affine subspaces and parallelism","<p>I'm learning affine geometry, specifically affine subspaces, and need help with the following exercise : </p>

<p>We are given an affine space $\mathbb{A}^3$ with basis $(a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3)$ and two affine subspaces $P_1, P_2$ defined by the affine spans $P_1 = \text{aff}(c_0, c_1, c_2), \, P_2 = \text{aff}(c'_0, c'_1, c'_2)$ where</p>

\end{array}</p>

<p>Show that $P_1, P_2$ are parallel planes. </p>

<hr>

<p>I'm sorry for the lack of effort on my part but I was not able to do much with this exercise. Since the notation being used can be troublesome I would like to make two remarks : </p>

<p>$(1)$ The basis $(a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3)$ of $\mathbb{A}^3$ can be written more formally as the affine frame $$\cal R = \{a_0, (\vec{a_0a_1}, \vec{a_0a_2}, \vec{a_0a_3})\}$$</p>

<p>where we arbitrary choose the point $a_0$ as the origin of the frame.  </p>

<p>$(2)$ The affine span (or affine hull) $P_1 = \text{aff}(c_0, c_1, c_2)$ is the set of all affine combinations of the points $\{c_i\}_{i=0}^{2}$, that is </p>

<p>$$P_1 = \text{aff}(c_0, c_1, c_2) = \left\{ \sum_{i = 0}^{2} \alpha_i c_i  : \alpha_i \in \mathbb{R} \, \text{and} \, \sum_{i = 0}^{2} \alpha_i = 1 \right\}.$$</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong> </p>

<p>The point $c_0$ is given as an affine combination of the points $a_i, i = 0, \ldots, 3$, where the coefficients $\lambda_i, i = 0, \ldots, 3$ are the barycentric coordinates of the point satisfying $$\sum_{i = 0}^{3} \lambda_i = 1.$$ </p>

<p>We now wish to determine the coordinates of the point $c_0$ w.r.t. the affine frame $\cal R = \{a_0, (\overrightarrow{a_0a_1}, \overrightarrow{a_0a_2}, \overrightarrow{a_0a_3})\}$. We note that </p>

<p>$$c_0 = -3a_0 + a_1 + 0a_2 + 3a_3 \tag{1}$$ and </p>

<p>$$-3 + 1 + 0 + 3 = 1 \implies -3 = 1 - 1 - 0 - 3\tag{2}$$</p>

<p>Substituting $(2)$ in $(1)$ we get </p>

<p>\begin{align}
c_0 &amp;= (1 - 1 - 0 - 3)a_0 + a_1+0a_2 + 3a_3 \\
&amp;= a_0 + 1(a_1 - a_0) + 0(a_2 - a_0) + 3(a_3 - a_0) \\ 
&amp;= a_0 + 1(\overrightarrow{a_0a_1}) + 0(\overrightarrow{a_0a_2}) + 3(\overrightarrow{a_0a_3}).
\end{align}</p>

<p>Hence, the coordinates of $c_0$ w.r.t. the affine frame $\mathcal{R}$ are $c_0 = (1, 0, 3)$. We proceed similarly for the points $c_1, c_2$ and get </p>

<p>$$c_1 = (3, -1, 2), \quad c_2 = (2, 1, 4).$$</p>

<p>Finally, </p>

<p>$$\overrightarrow{c_0c_1}=\begin{bmatrix}\phantom{-}3-1\\-1-0\\\phantom{-}2-3\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\phantom{-}2\\-1\\-1\end{bmatrix},\quad \overrightarrow{c_0c_2}= \begin{bmatrix}2 - 1\\ 1-0 \\ 4 - 3 \end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.$$</p>

Consider the sequence $(N_i)_{i\in\mathbb N}$, if $\sup_{i} N_i&lt;\infty$ the result trivially holds without taking subsequences.

However I'm not sure this is going to work, since if $(N_i)_i$ is not bounded then I'm going to start my subsequences by taking as initial indexed numbers that are arbitrarily large...

<p>another approach: Let $N_i$ be defined as above and, for each $n\in\mathbb N$, take a subsequence $(q^{i_k}_n)_n$ of the sequences $(q^i_n)_n$ such that $N_{i_{k+1}}\ge N_{i_{k}}$, and consider the sequences $(q^{i_k}_{N_k})_k$, then, for all $k\in\mathbb N$ I have $\|q^{i_k}_{N_k}-\bar q^{i_k}\|\le 2^{-i_k}$. Therefore even if ""weaker"", in this way I have a subsequence that satisfy such inequality uniformly in $k$. Is that correct?</p>

Consider a measure space $(\Omega,{\mathscr F},\mu)$ and a $\mu$-measurable function $f:\Omega\to[0,\infty]$. The <strong>upper integral</strong> is defined as
$$\int^*fd\mu=\inf\sum_i\left(\sup_{\omega\in A_i}f(\omega)\right)\mu(A_i),$$
where the infimum is taken over all finite partitions $\{A_i\}$ of $\Omega$ into ${\scr F}$-sets.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong> <em>(15.1, Part 2)</em>:
Show that $\int^*fd\mu=\infty$ if $\mu\{\omega:f(\omega)\geq x\}&gt;0$ for all (finite) $x$.</p>

<p>What I've tried so far is to find a lower bound, in terms of $x$, for $\sum_i\left(\sup_{\omega\in A_i}f(\omega)\right)\mu(A_i)$ and show that this lower bound is not bounded above (as a function of $x$):</p>

<p>Fix an arbitrary finite $x$. Let $B_x=\{\omega:f(\omega)\geq x\}$. Note that for any finite partition $\{A_i\}$ of $\Omega$ into ${\scr F}$-sets, $\sum_i\left(\sup_{\omega\in A_i}f(\omega)\right)\mu(A_i)\geq \sum_ix\mu(A_i\cap B_x)=x\mu(B_x)$.</p>

$$\mu(B_x)=\begin{cases}e^{-x}&amp;\text{(if $x\geq0$)}\\1&amp;\text{(if $x&lt;0$)}\end{cases}$$

<p>Now I know several results relating to those ratios of double factorials 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin^{2n} \theta d \theta= \frac{ \pi}{2} \frac{(2n-1)!!}{(2n)!!} \tag{1} \\
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(2n-1)!!}{(2n)!!} y^n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-y}} \tag{2}
\end{eqnarray*}
From these two results it is reasonably easy to derive the series for the elliptic integral of the first kind
\begin{eqnarray*}
K(k)=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{d \theta}{\sqrt{1-k^2 \sin^{2}(\theta)}} =\frac{\pi}{2} \left(1+ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2+ \left(\frac{1.3}{2.4}\right)^2+ \cdots \right)

So my first thought is to use $(1)$ three times, sum the geometric plum &amp; we have

\end{eqnarray*}
This triple integral looks difficult so ...</p>

<p>Second thoughts ... use $(1)$ twice &amp; then use $(2)$ to get the double integral
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}  \frac{d \alpha d \beta }{\sqrt{1+ \sin^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta }}
\end{eqnarray*}
now substitute $ \sqrt{s} =\sin \alpha$ and $ \sqrt{t} =\sin \beta$ (might have lost a factor of $4$)
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{1}  \frac{d s d t }{\sqrt{s(1-s)t(1-t)(1+st) }}
\end{eqnarray*}
&amp; I am not sure what to do with this.</p>

But still I can't prove that $n(y_{2n}-y_n)\to \infty$. I have no condition on the growth of $y_{2n}-y_n$ - it could even go to $0$. For instance, the sequence $y_{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{{\left\lfloor \log_2 n\right\rfloor}}\frac{1}{k}$ has

Let $N_r(p)$ stand for a neighborhood of $p$ of radius $r.$<br>
So we have $N_r(p) \cap E = \{p\}$ meaning $p$ is not a limit point.<br>
But limit points can be outside $E$ so we must check every point $q \in X$ a well.<br>
By definition of limit points, $N_k(q) \cap E \ne \emptyset$ must hold for all $k &gt; 0$ for $q$ to be a limit point. So if we can find some $k &gt; 0$ s.t. $N_k(q) \cap E = \emptyset,$ then we can say that no point in $X$ is a limit point of $E. $ So let $0 &lt; k &lt; d(p, q).$ Then $N_k(q)$ contains all points of $X$ that bunch up around $q$ in a radius that is smaller than the distance from $p$ to $q$ meaning $p$ is outside the cluster of points $N_k(q).$ So, $N_k(q) \cap E = \emptyset.$ Thus, neither $p,$ nor any other point in $X$ is a limit point of $E$ meaning $E$ has no limit points.</p>

"2393883","2393918","Converting Churn Rate in Customer Lifetime","<p>A service has an 80% Annual Customer <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Churn Rate</a>. It means that the service loses 80% of its customers every year.</p>

<p>The -80% Annual Churn Rate can be converted to a -12.55% Monthly Churn Rate with the formula:</p>

<pre><code>(1-0.8)^(1/12)-1
</code></pre>

<p>The image below shows the churns period after period. We can see that the 80% Annual Rate leads to the same number of customers of the 12.55% Monthly Rate after 1, 2 and 3 years.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H8ZJy.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H8ZJy.png"" alt=""Churn Rate effect over time""></a></p>

<p>When talking about Customer Churn Rate, it is also common to talk about Average Customer Lifetime, that is the average time that a customer uses the service before churning. <a href=""http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/saas-metrics-2-definitions-2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This site</a> says that we can use the following formula to find the average Customer Lifetime: </p>

<pre><code>Customer Lifetime = 1 / Customer Churn Rate
</code></pre>

<p>The same site also says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that if the Customer Churn rate is a monthly % or annual %, then
  the Customer Lifetime will be for the same time period. Here is a
  monthly and annual example to illustrate the point:</p>
  
  <p>a) If the Monthly customer churn rate is 3%, then the Customer
  Lifetime will be 1/0.03 which is 33 months.</p>
  
  <p>b) if the Annual customer churn rate is 20%, then the Customer
  Lifetime will be 1/0.20 which is 5 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to that we can say that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a) If the Monthly customer churn rate is 12.55%, then the Customer
  Lifetime will be 1/0.1255 which is 7.97 months.</p>
  
  <p>b) if the Annual customer churn rate is 80%, then the Customer
  Lifetime will be 1/0.80 which is 1.25 years (15 months).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But we have calculated in the beginning that an 80% annual churn rate corresponds to an 12.55% monthly churn rate. How can these equivalent rates lead to two different lifetimes?</p>

<p>In other words, how can an 80% annual Churn Rate be equivalent to a 12.55% Monthly Churn Rate, but the former leads to a lifetime of 15 months, while the latter leads to a lifetime of 7.97 months?</p>

<hr>

<h1>Edit:</h1>

<p>After David's answer, I've got new questions related to the topic. I am editing this question to address them and also to confirm if I have understood correctly what David have kindly explained.</p>

<p>From what I could understand, the formula <code>Average Customer Lifetime = 1 / Churn Rate</code> assumes that cancellations occur in a linear fashion during the cohort period. For example: a Cohort with an annual Churn Rate of 80% and that starts with 240,000 customers, would have to lose 16,000 each month. And, within each month, it would have to lose 533 per day.</p>

<p>However, in an exponential decay model, the above formula is not perfect. I understood that if the Churn Rate is small, it becomes acceptable to use it, because the result would be close to reality. But what to do when the Churn Rate is high?</p>

<p><strong>I thought the following ...</strong></p>

<p>By David's response, I understood that it is correct to use the formula <code>(1-0.8)^(1/12)-1</code> to convert the annual rate of -80% into a monthly rate of -12.55%, when we are in an exponential decay model. So, why not to convert the high annual Churn Rate of 80% to a low daily Churn Rate, and then use the formula that calculates Lifetime (suitable for low Churn Rates)?</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

<p>Suppose that I have enough data to know that my service has an annual Churn Rate of 80% and that the decay is exponential. I want to calculate an Average Customer Lifetime that is close to reality. So I do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Convert the -80% annual rate to a daily rate: <code>(1-0.8)^(1/365)-1 = -0.44%</code></li>
<li>Calculate the Average Lifetime (in days): <code>1 / 0.0044 = 227 days = 7.57 months</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If I had calculated the Average Lifetime using the 80% rate directly, I would have come up with a result of 15 months (<code>1 / 0.8 = 1.25 years = 15 months</code>), which I believe to be much further from reality in comparison to the 7.57 months resulted from using the daily rate.</p>

<p><strong>Does this make any sense?</strong></p>

"2394045","2394078","Mean value property of harmonic functions on manifolds","<p>A well-known feature of harmonic functions on (domains of) $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the mean-value property: that is, if $\Delta u = 0$, then
$$ u(x_0) = \frac{1}{\text{Vol}(\partial B_r(x_0))}\int_{\partial B_r(x_0)}{u\,dS} = \frac{1}{\text{Vol}(B_r(x_0))}\int_{B_r(x_0)}{u\,dV}. $$
Is the same true on manifolds in general? That is, given a manifold $(M,g)$ and a smooth function $u:M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ satisfying
$$\Delta_gu = 0\quad\text{where}\quad\Delta_g = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\det g}}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}g^{ij}\sqrt{\det g}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j},$$
is it true that
$$ u(x_0) = \frac{1}{\text{Vol}(\partial B_r(x_0))}\int_{\partial B_r(x_0)}{u\,dS}\quad\text{or}\quad u(x_0) = \frac{1}{\text{Vol}(B_r(x_0))}\int_{B_r(x_0)}{u\,dV}?$$
Here, $B_r(x_0)$ is the geodesic ball of radius $r$ around $x_0$. If the equalities do not hold, how would the average value (either over a sphere or over a ball) change with $r$? For example, on a surface the Gaussian curvature appears in the higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of the length/area of a circle/ball of radius $r$--does a similar phenomenon occur for the mean value?</p>

"2394282","2394289","Symmetry in a Double Integral","<p>I was working on the following two part question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Evaluate $$ \frac{5}{2} \iint_D x\left[1+y(x^2+y^2)\right] dA$$</li>
</ul>

<p>where D is the region of integration bounded by the lines $y=1, x=1, \text{and the curve } y=x^3$.</p>

<p>I used the bounds $D = \left\{(x,y): -1\le x \le 1, x^3 \le y \le 1\right\}$</p>

<p>This was fairly simple to do as the double integral itself evaluates to $\frac{-2}{5}$, which makes sense since when combined with the factor of to $\frac{5}{2}$ we get $-1$ which <em>feels</em> like a <em>crisp clean</em> answer.</p>

<p>The second part of the problem is where I got stuck:</p>

<ul>
<li>If $f$ is a continuous function of a single variable, evaluate $$\frac{5}{2} \iint_D x\left[1+yf(x^2+y^2)\right] dA$$
<em>Hint: Use the symmetry properties of the integral</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I have come to the conclusion of two possible answers:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is $-1$, because if we let $f(t)=t$ and then let $t=x^2+y^2$, we arrive back to the first part of the question no matter what $f$ is? However, I do feel there is some heavily flawed logic in this argument, but it's what first catches my attention when comparing the two situations.</p></li>
<li><p>It is $0$, because if we were to expand the integrand as so: $$\frac{5}{2} \iint_D x+xyf(x^2+y^2)\ dA$$ it seems like the appearance of $xy$ and $x^2+y^2$ is where the symmetry comes along because switching $x\text{ and } y$ which might mean it evalutes to $0$ for some reason? Or that the whole second term cancels out somehow and we are left with only $x$ in the integrand. 
Somewhere there must arise a situation of invariant transformations and it looks to be something simple, but its at the ""tip of my tongue"".</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any thoughts or help on this is greatly appreciated.</p>

\iint_C\ln(x^2+y^2)=\int_0^{\pi/4}\int_0^1 \ln(r^2)r \,dr\,d\theta=\frac{1}{2}\int\bigg[ r^2\ln r^2-r^2\bigg]_0^1=\frac{1}{2}\int-1\,d\theta=-\frac{\pi}{8}

<p>The portion of interest is near the last parts of the proof.</p>

<hr>

<p>Theorem:</p>

<p>If $V,W$ are subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space, then
$dim(V+W)=dimV+dimW-dim(V\cap W)$.</p>

<p>Proof:</p>

<p>Let $V\cap W$ have basis $(u_1,\dots ,u_m)$, with $dim(V\cap W)=m$.</p>

<p>A basis is linearly independent by definition. Therefore, we can extend the
basis of $V\cap W$ to a basis $(u_1,\dots ,u_m,v_1\dots ,v_j)$ of $V$, with
$dimV=m+j$.</p>

<p>We also extend the basis of $V\cap W$ to a basis $(u_1,\dots ,u_m,w_1\dots
,w_k)$ of $W$, with $dimW=m+k$.</p>

<p>Let $union$ be the list of vectors $(u_1,\dots ,u_m,v_1,\dots ,v_j,w_1,\dots
,w_k)$. We will show that $union$ is a basis of $V+W$. Doing so will complete
the proof because:</p>

"2394445","2394478","Clay Institute Navier Stokes Part 2","<p>This is an extension to my question here: <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2174742/clay-institute-navier-stokes"">Clay Institute Navier Stokes</a> . Last time my solution was wrong because my velocity vector did not use bounded functions. Also someone said that I am only showing one example, but I'm trying to prove a statement that says ""there exists"" so I should only have to find one right? I have looked into smooth and bounded functions and it looks like Gaussian functions are good examples, so I have rewritten another example. If you could please tell me what is still wrong/not satisfactory.</p>

<p>We are trying to satisfy:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \textbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\textbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\textbf{u}=-\frac{\nabla P}{\rho} + \nu\nabla^{2}\textbf{u}+\textbf{f},
\end{equation}</p>

<p>\begin{equation}\label{incompr}
\nabla\cdot\textbf{u}=0.
\end{equation}</p>

<p>We get to pick a velocity (u) and pressure (P) function to satisfy these equations. We take $n=3$ by putting our velocity and pressure vectors in the 3D Cartesian plane with $x,y,z$. We let $\textbf{f}$ be 0 according to the problem description, and assume kinematic viscosity (nu) to be greater than 0. Let</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
     \textbf{u}(x,t)=\begin{bmatrix}
                e^{-t^2} \\
                e^{-t^2} \\
                e^{-t^2} 
                \end{bmatrix}           
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Then $\textbf{u}(x,t)$ satisfies the divergence free condition because </p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \textbf{u} = \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial u_3}{\partial z}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>which is</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \textbf{u} = 0+0+0=0
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Then </p>

<p>\begin{equation}\frac{\partial \textbf{u}}{\partial t}=\begin{bmatrix}
                -2te^{-t^2} \\
                -2te^{-t^2} \\
                -2te^{-t^2} 
                \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>And</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\textbf{u} \cdot \nabla = (e^{-t^2})\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + (e^{-t^2})\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+(e^{-t^2})\frac{\partial}{\partial z}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>And</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(\textbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\textbf{u} &amp;= (e^{-t^2})\frac{\partial \textbf{u}}{\partial x} + (e^{-t^2})\frac{\partial \textbf{u}}{\partial y}+(e^{-t^2})\frac{\partial \textbf{u}}{\partial z} \\
           &amp;=(e^{-t^2})\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}+(e^{-t^2})\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}+(e^{-t^2})\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \\
           &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{split}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Since laplacian of $\textbf{u}$ is 0 the whole kinematic velocity term goes to 0. And the final Navier-Stokes expression is:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix} -2te^{-t^2} \\ -2te^{-t^2} \\ -2te^{-t^2} \end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}=-\frac{\nabla P}{\rho}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>So we set $\rho$ equal to 1 for easy calculation. Bring the negative to the left hand side and combine the left hand side.</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix} 2te^{-t^2} \\ 2te^{-t^2} \\ 2te^{-t^2} \end{bmatrix}=\nabla P
\end{equation}</p>

<p>and we solve for a solution for P</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
P=2 e^{-t^2} t x + 2 e^{-t^2} t y + 2 e^{-t^2} t z
\end{equation}</p>

<p>So we now have infinitely differentiable functions for u and P.

That implies that there are vector fields that there are not gradient fields. The gradient field is composted of a vector and each $\mathbf{i}$, $\mathbf{j}$, $\mathbf{k}$ component (using 3 dimensions) is multiplied by a scalar that is a partial derivative. Is this because the scalar may be of the form that there is no antiderivative of? Perhaps of a function that can not be differentiated? Maybe a vector field that has sharp turns but I can't come up with any that I can't find a derivative for. Does anybody have any so I can get some intuition of the problem?</p>

  <p>Calculate $\oint_C xyz\,dx+x^2\,dy+xz\,dz$ over the curve from the intersection of paraboloid $z=x^2+y^2$ and plane $z=2x$. The direction of the curve may be chosen as you see fit. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like if we chose to parametrize the curve and plug in the appropriate values straight into the integral, the calculation would be become pretty massive.</p>

<p>I'd like to try this with Stokes' theorem. </p>

<p><strong>My main question</strong> is whether we're allowed to choose any surface when using Stokes' because here we have 2: paraboloid and plane, of which plane is of course much easier.</p>

<p>Then the normal unit vector for the plane in the negative direction is:
$$
n=\langle2,0,1\rangle/dS
$$
The vector field is:
$$
F=\langle xyz, x^2,xz\rangle
$$
and
$$
\operatorname{curl}F=\langle 0,xy-z,2x-xz\rangle
$$
We can get the ranges for the curve:
$$
x^2+y^2=2x\iff(x-1)^2+y^2=1\\
\implies0\le r\le 2\cos\theta, \quad-\pi/2\le\theta\le\pi/2
$$</p>

<p>Then:
$$
\oint_CF\cdot dr=\iint_S \operatorname{curl}F\cdot ndS=\\
=\iint_S 2x-xz\stackrel{z=2x}{=}\iint_S 2x-2x^2=\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}\int_0^{2\cos\theta} (2r\cos\theta-2r^2\cos^2\theta)r
$$
So my question is mostly if I can choose any surface when using Stokes' and whether my ranges are correct?</p>

From $\sin\theta\cos\theta&lt;0$ we only take $x&lt;0$ &amp; $y&lt;0$ since it is already stated. Now,
$$
\cos^2\theta-\sin^2\theta&lt;0\implies\cos^2\theta&lt;\sin^2\theta\implies|\cos\theta|&lt;|\sin\theta|\implies|x|&lt;|y|

Since both $x,y&lt;0$, I think $|x|=-x$ &amp; $|y|=-y$

|x|&lt;|y|\implies-x&lt;-y\implies x&gt;y

"2394513","2396962","Geometric algebra: Rotation of a rotor","<p><strong>In short my question is: Why is the rotation of a rotor in geometric algebra implemented by a single-sided rotation?</strong></p>

<p>To elaborate:</p>

<p>In geometric algebra, rotating an object is done by multiplying it double-sidedly by a rotor and its inverse:</p>

<p>$$V_{\text{rotated}}=RVR^\dagger\qquad(1)$$</p>

<p>A rotor is defined as a normalized element consisting of scalar part and a bivector part:</p>

<p>$$R(\theta) = \cos(\theta/2) + \sin(\theta/2)B = e^{\theta/2 B}$$
$$RR^\dagger=1,$$</p>

<p>where $B$ is a normalized bivector.</p>

<p>However it is claimed, in e.g. Doran &amp; Lasenby's Geometric algebra for physicists, that the rotation of a rotor itself is obtained by multiplying it single-sidedly by a rotor:</p>

<p>$$R_{1,\text{rotated by }R2} = R_2R_1$$</p>

<p>As a clarifying example the rotation of rotated vector is then shown:</p>

<p>$$V_{\text{rotated by }R1\text{ and }R2}=R_2R_1VR_1^\dagger R_2^\dagger=R_{\text{tot}}VR_{\text{tot}}^\dagger$$
$$R_{\text{tot}}=R_2R_1,$$</p>

<p>claiming that this shows the rotor $R_1$ is rotated by left multiplication by $R_2$. </p>

<p>I do not understand this claim. I would expect that to know how $R_1$ behaves under rotation by $R_2$, one should check that equation $(1)$, with $R=R_1$, still holds in a frame rotated by $R_2$. One should therefore rotate all elements in equation $(1)$:</p>

<p>$$V_{\text{rotated by }R1\text{ and }R2}=R_{1,\text{rotated by }R2}V_{\text{rotated by }R2}R_{1,\text{rotated by }R2}^\dagger$$ </p>

<p>This leads to a double-sided multiplication rule for rotors:</p>

<p>$$R_{1,\text{rotated by }R2}=R_2R_1R_2^\dagger$$</p>

<p>Which is clearly different from the single sided form. </p>

Let $r &lt; $ smallest $q \in X.$ Then $N_r(p)$ contains all points of $X$ that are to the left of the smallest $q$ on the number line meaning all $q \in X$ fall outside $N_r(p).$ For example, if the smallest $q = 1$ and $r = 0.5,$ all points $\ge 1 \ \in X$  are too large to fit in the distance between p and $0.5.$ But the interval within the radius $r$ contains $p$ and probably some other points smaller than $q.$ Since we are only worried about $p$ and $q,$ we ignore all other points $&lt; q$ (that are not $p$).

The order doesn't matter. For example, I have a sum of '10' and set of [1,2] and I want to know in how many ways can 1 and 2 be added up to reach 10.

I am working with larger sets and numbers, so simple approach will be very useful. Thank-you</p>

<p>No the order does not matter for the sum. Whether it is 10 = 2*one + 4*two or 4*two + 2*one or any other permutation of them. The attempt I made involves the use of a computer. I was thinking about something like this.  </p>

<p>I am struggling with the following proposition from Bourn's <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267082321_Moore_normalization_and_Dold-Kan_theorem_for_semi-abelian_categories"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Moore Normalization and Dold-Kan for Semi-Abelian Categories</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 1.1.</strong> $\mathrm N_0:\mathsf{Pt}(\mathsf C)\to \mathsf C\times \mathsf C$ is defined and that $\mathsf C$ admits finite products. Then the functor $\mathrm N_0$ has a left adjoint $\Sigma_0$ iff $\mathsf C$ has coproducts.</p>

<p>Given coproducts, I understand the left adjoint should take $(A,B)$ to $((1,0):A\amalg B\leftrightarrows A:\iota_1)$.

I don't understand how this proposition proves the existence of coproducts from existence of the left adjoint in our setting. I'm trying to mimic its proof by parts, namely to prove the left square below is a pushout by producing a unique factorization for every commutative diagram as on the left below. By moving from $C$ to $A\times C$ we can obtain another point over $A$ as in the diagram on the right, whence the adjunction provides the broken arrow.</p>

  <p>Q2.

So $O_{A^n}(U)$ is realized as inverse limit of $O(D_i)$. It looks like for most of $U\subset A^n$, I see them as some sort of localization of $O(A^n)$. Is there a counter example to this?</p>
  
  <p>Q3. $O(U)=O(\cup D_i)=\cap O(D_i)$. $\cup D_i$ can be realized as direct limit. $O(\cup D_i)$ are regular functions from $D_i$ to $k$ which is basically $\mathrm{Hom}(-,k)$. So $\mathrm{Hom}$ converts the direct limit to inverse limit. However this conversion is in abelian category. How should I realize this notion? Or is this notion correct?</p>

<p>We also note that if $V_p \subseteq V_f$ and $g\neq 0$, then $V_{pg} \subseteq V_{fg}$, since if $v\in V_{pg}$ and $v\not\in V_{fg}$, we have $g(T)(p(T)(v)) = 0$ and $g(T)(f(T)(v)) \neq 0$, which shows that $v\in V_p$ and $v\not\in V_f$.

<p>which can be shown by induction ( i have typped the proof here but somehow i lost it).</p>

<p>$$ \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt[3]{b}) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt[3]{b})$$</p>

<p>but I cannot use any Galois theory to do so, as we have not gotten to it yet in my course. </p>

<p>I was given a hint: ""let $G$ and $H$ denote the left-hand side and the right-hand side, respectively; analyze possibilities for the dimension $[H:G]$ and use thee fact that $G(\sqrt{a}) = G(\sqrt[3]{b}) = H$"".</p>

<p>However, instead, I approached it similarly to Paramanand Singh's answer to <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/937071/mathbfq-sqrt-5-sqrt3-2-mathbfq-sqrt-5-sqrt3-2?rq=1"">this question</a>. But, I am not sure such an approach is correct in this situation. </p>

<p>Anyway, this is what I did, according to Paramanand's method:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is obvious that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt[3]{b}) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt[3]{b})$, since $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt[3]{b}$ is a linear combination of $\sqrt{a}$ and $\sqrt[3]{b}$</p>
  
  <p>Now, for the other side, let $c = \sqrt{a}+\sqrt[3]{b}$.</p>
  
  <p>WTS: $e=\sqrt{a}$, $f = \sqrt[3]{b}$ are rational functions of $c$.</p>
  
  <p>$$ (c-e)^{3} = b \, \to \, c^{3}-3c^{2}e + 3ac - ae = b \, \to \, 3c^{2}e + ae = -b + c^{3}+3ac \, \to \, e = \frac{c^{3} + 3ac - b}{3c^{2} + a}\, \to \, \sqrt{a} = \frac{c^{3} + 3ac -b }{3c^{2}+a} $$</p>
  
  <p>So that $\sqrt{a}$ is a rational function of $c$.</p>
  
  <p>Also, since $c = e + f = \sqrt{a} + \sqrt[3]{b}$, we have that $\sqrt[3]{b} = c - \sqrt{a}$, so that $\sqrt[3]{b}$ is also a rational function of $c$.</p>
  
  <p>Therefore $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt[3]{b}) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt[3]{b})$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, something about this is not sitting right with me. Is this, in fact, the correct way to prove it? Or should I do it the way my professor suggested? I would also like some help doing it that way.</p>

<p>I guess for that way, we could still start out by stating that ""It is obvious that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt[3]{b}) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt[3]{b})$, since $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt[3]{b}$ is a linear combination of $\sqrt{a}$ and $\sqrt[3]{b}$"" (if this is, in fact, true). Then, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt[3])$ has degree $6$, right?</p>

<p>So, I would need to show that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt[3]{b})$ also has degree $6$, but I still don't see what this has to do with the hint...</p>

<p>If I let $G = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt[3]{b})$ and $H = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt[3]{b})$, then of course $G(\sqrt{a}) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt[3]{b})(\sqrt{a}) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt[3]{b})(\sqrt[3]{b})$, but I still don't see how this helps!</p>

Every element of $G$ can be written in the normal form $a+bu$ where $a, b \in F$. I need to find an expression (in the normal form) for thee element $(a+u)^{-1}$ where $a \in F$.</p>

<p>This problem has become the bane of my existence over the past few days, as I have tried to model my answer off of an example given to us in our lecture notes, which I suspect is incorrect itself. So, I suppose part of my question here is asking whether the example problem is actually incorrectly solved.</p>

<p>The example problem says that in the case of the extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ by a root $u$ of the irreducible polynomial $f = x^{2} + x + 1$, to find an expression for $(a+bu)^{-1}$, we have to divide $f$ by $a+bx$ with remainder by using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The result of this is the following sequence of steps, which I have tried myself and found to be correct:</p>

<p>$$x^{2} + x + 1 = \left( \frac{1}{b}x\right)(a+bx) + \left( 1 - \frac{a}{b}\right)x + 1 \\ =  \left( \frac{1}{b}x\right) (a+bx) + \frac{1}{b} \left( 1 - \frac{a}{b}\right)(a+bx) + \left( \frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}} - \frac{a}{b} + 1\right) \\ = \left(\frac{1}{b}x+\frac{1}{b}-\frac{a}{b^{2}} \right)(a+bx)+\left(  \frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}} - \frac{a}{b} + 1\right)$$</p>

<p>My professor then proceeds to say that $\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}- \frac{a}{b} + 1 \neq 0$ because then a rational number $-\frac{a}{b}$ would be a root of $f$. Also, even though technically, one additional step needs to be completed in the Euclidean Algorithm, we already have a polynomial $h \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $h(a+bx)-1$ is a multiple of $f$.</p>

<p>So, he multiplies the equality through by $\left(  \frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}} - \frac{a}{b} + 1\right)^{-1}$ to obtain </p>

<p>$$ \left(  \frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}} - \frac{a}{b} + 1\right)^{-1}(x^{2}+x + 1) = \left(  \frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}} - \frac{a}{b} + 1\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{b}x+\frac{1}{b}-\frac{a}{b^{2}} \right)(a+bx) + 1$$</p>

<p>and then takes $h = -\left(  \frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}} - \frac{a}{b} + 1\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{b}x+\frac{1}{b}-\frac{a}{b^{2}} \right) = \frac{1}{a^{2}-ab+b^{2}}(a-b-bx) $, so that $h(u) = \frac{1}{a^{2}-ab+b^{2}}(a-b-bu)$.</p>

<p>However, $h(u)(a+bu) \neq 1$ like he says it is: I multiplied it out myself to get $$ h(u) (a+ bu) = \frac{a-b-bu}{a^{2}-ab+b^{2}}(a+bu) \\ = \frac{a^{2}-ab-abu + abu -b^{2}u - b^{2}u^{2}}{a^{2}-ab+b^{2}} \\ = \frac{a^{2}-ab-b^{2}u-b^{2}u^{2}}{a^{2}-ab+b^{2}}  \\ = \frac{a^{2}-ab-b^{2}(u+u^{2}}{a^{2}-ab+b^{2}} \neq 1 $$.</p>

<p>But, I can find absolutely no error in the process by which my professor found his function $h$! What am I missing here??</p>

<p>I need to know how to do that example problem in order to do the real problem I am trying to tackle, and that is finding $(a+u)^{-1}$ for $f = x^{2}+px+q$ over a general field $F$ (so, $p,q \in F$ in case you were wondering). I did a similar process to what my professor did, applying the extended Euclidean algorithm to divide $f$ by $a+x$:</p>

<p>$$x^{2}+px+q = x(a+x) + (p-a)(a+x) + q -(p-a)a \\ = (x+(p-a))(a+x)+(q-(p-a)a) $$</p>

<p>Like in the example problem, here the remainder $q - (p-a)a \neq 0$, because then otherwise $-a \in F$ would be a root of $f$ when we claimed it was irreducible over $F$ (a contradiction). </p>

<p>So, because of this, I know that the remainder has an inverse, and I can multiply the equality through by said inverse, $(q - (p-a)a)^{-1} $ to obtain </p>

<p>$$(q - (p-a)a)^{-1} (x^{2}+px+q) = (q - (p-a)a)^{-1}(x+(p-a))(a+x) + 1$$</p>

<p>Then, I took $$h = -  (q - (p-a)a)^{-1}(x+(p-a)) \\ = \frac{-x-(p-a)}{q-(p-a)a} = \frac{a - p - x}{a^{2}-pa+q} $$</p>

<p>Then, letting $h(u) = \frac{a-p-u}{a^{2}-pa+q}$, we <strong>should</strong> have $h(u)(a+u) = 1$, but instead I get $h(u)(a+u) = \left(\frac{a-p-u}{a^{2}-pa+q} \right)(a+u) = \frac{a^{2}-pa - up +u^{2}}{a^{2}-pa+q}$, and not $1$!</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong??! </p>

<p>However, the ""dual"" sequence $A\to A\amalg B\underset{(0,1)}\leftrightarrows B$ is generally far from exact. Its exactness hints at a commutative situation. Consider for instance the category of monoids. The arrow $(0,1)$ acts on a reduced word via 
$bab^\prime\mapsto bb^\prime$. If $bb^\prime=1\in B$ then $bab^\prime\in \operatorname{Ker}(0,1)\setminus A$, so the sequence is not exact.</p>

<p>Does the exactness of $A\to A\amalg B\underset{(0,1)}\leftrightarrows B$ in fact imply $A\amalg B\cong A\times B$? If not, what does it imply along this direction?</p>

"2394968","2395062","Bootstrapping the Product Category","<p>It's my understanding that category theory can be used as a foundation of mathematics, and that it is not dependent on set theory in that respect. My question is about exactly how products come about.</p>

<p>The ""universal"" definition of products says that for $a,b \in C$, they have a product $a\times b$ if there's two arrows $\pi_1: a\times b \to a,\  \pi_2: a\times b \to b$ such that for any object $c$ with arrows $f: c\to a, g : c\to b$ there's a unique arrow $h: d\to a\times b$ making everything commute.</p>

<p>The formal basis for universal constructions like this is the definition of a functor and a limit. Specifically we take an index category $J = \cdot \leftarrow \cdot \rightarrow \cdot$ and let the limit be the right adjoint of the generalized diagonal functor $\Delta : C \to C^J $. In other words, we use exponentiation of a category to define products. But the category exponent requires category products first.</p>

<p>See e.g. <a href=""https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-07-dynamics-fall-2009/lecture-notes/MIT16_07F09_Lec05.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-07-dynamics-fall-2009/lecture-notes/MIT16_07F09_Lec05.pdf</a>. </p>

<p>In particular, the vectors $e_r$ and $e_\theta$ actually changes depending on where the point $(r,\theta)$ is. I am struggling to understand these equations mathematically.</p>

<p>First, I am most used to describing the tangent plane as something like $\frac{\partial}{\partial r}, \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}$. But then e.g. $\frac{d\frac{\partial}{\partial r}}{d \theta}$ makes no sense to me. Is there any way to recover this point of view or is it too algebraic? </p>

<p>Now, geometrically if we consider $e_r, e_\theta$ to be just vectors then I can understand how to obtain these equations I think. They basically come from identifying all the tangent spaces as a single $\mathbb{R}^2$ plane in the obvious way so that we can actually compare vectors that belong in different tangent spaces. Then e.g. the first equation $\frac{d e_r}{d \theta}=e_\theta$ comes from looking at $\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{e_r^2-e_r^1}{h}$ where $e_r^1$ is that basis vector at $(r,\theta)$ and $e_r^2$ is that basis vector at $(r,\theta+h)$. I switched to cartesian coordinates to compute the limit then switched back to polar coords.</p>

<p>$(3)$ there are $(4-j)$  solvers among the $(16-i)$ solvers. This can be done in $\binom{16-i}{4-j}$ ways.</p>

<p>The set of $4$ students can be constructed by $\binom{16}{4}$ ways.</p>

<p>Consequently, the probability that the $ith$  solver among all $16$ students  is the $jth$ solver of $jth$ room $(j=1,2,3,4)$ is</p>

<p>$$\frac{\binom{i-1}{j-1}\binom{16-i}{4-j}}{\binom{16}{4}}.$$</p>

<p>Hence the probability that the student having the $i$th $(i=1,2,\ldots,16)$ ordered solving time was the $1st$ solver of the $1st$ room or the $2nd$ solver of the $2nd$ room or the $3rd$ solver of the $3rd$ room or the $last$ solver of the $last$ room, that is,  the probability that the $ith$ $(i=1,2,\ldots,16)$ ordered solver to be selected for the next task is:</p>

<p>But equation $(A)$ produces probability $\frac{1}{4}$ for any $i$. It seems there is no difference between the following 2 criteria:</p>

<p><em>criteria 1</em> The probability that a student is selected for the next task is $1/4$, that is, it doesn't depend on the rank information.</p>

<p><em>criteria 2</em> The student having the $i$th $(i=1,2,\ldots,16)$ ordered solving time get the next task if and only if he was the $1st$ solver of the $1st$ room or the $2nd$ solver of the $2nd$ room or the $3rd$ solver of the $3rd$ room or the $last$ solver of the $last$ room. </p>

<p>But If I set the problem as: A student is selected for the next task if he is the $1st$ solver of the $1st$ room or the $2nd$ solver of the $2nd$ room or the $1st$ solver of the $3rd$ room or the $2nd$ solver of the $last$ room.

<blockquote>
  <p>For each $n\geq 1,$ let 
  $$a_n = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^n}{k!}, \,\, b_n = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{k^n}{k!}.$$
  Show that $a_nb_n$ is an integer. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My attempt: </p>

<p>Clearly $b_n = (-1)^n a_n.$
So for odd $n,$ we have $a_n+b_n = 0$ and for even $n,$ we have $a_n=b_n.$</p>

<p>So I thought I wanted to show that $(a_n)^2$ is an integer, but it turns out that it is not by <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%5Csum_%7Bk%3D1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bk!%7D"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wolfram Alpha</a>.</p>

<p>However, when I keyed in the required product for $n=1,$ it turns out that <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(%5Csum_%7Bk%3D1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bk!%7D)(%5Csum_%7Bk%3D1%7D%5E%5Cinfty(-1)%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bk!%7D)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">it is not an integer</a>. Is the question correct?</p>

<p>EDITED: It seems that $(-1)^n$ should be $(-1)^k.$ In other words, the correct question is as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For each $n\geq 1,$ let 
  $$a_n = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^n}{k!}, \,\, b_n = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{k^n}{k!}.$$
  Show that $a_nb_n$ is an integer. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDITED AGAIN: I notice that 
$$a_n=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k}{k!} = e$$
$$a_n=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^2}{k!} = 2e$$
$$a_n=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^3}{k!} = 5e$$
$$a_n=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^4}{k!} = 15e$$
and $b_n$ contains an integer of $e^{-1}.$ 
So $a_nb_n$ will cancel $e,$ left with integers only. 
So I wanted to prove a general formula for 
$$\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^n}{k!} = ?$$
using induction. However, I fail to obtain a general form. </p>

"2395277","2396236","Why is modeling the joint distribution between many continuous random variables, obtains generalization more easily?","<p>In the paper ""A Neural Probabilistic Language Model"", by Toshua Bengio et Al., there is the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A fundamental problem that makes language modeling and other learning
  problems difficult is the curse of dimensionality. It is particularly
  obvious in the case when one wants to model the joint distribution
  between many discrete random variables (such as words in a sentence,
  or discrete attributes in a data-mining task). For example, if one
  wants to model the joint distribution of 10 consecutive words in a
  natural language with a vocabulary V of size 100,000, there are
  potentially 10000010 − 1 = 1050 − 1 free parameters. When modeling
  continuous variables, we obtain generalization more easily (e.g. with
  smooth classes of functions like multi-layer neural networks or
  Gaussian mixture models) because the function to be learned can be
  expected to have some local smoothness properties. For discrete
  spaces, the generalization structure is not as obvious: any change of
  these discrete variables may have a drastic impact on the value of the
  function to be estimated, and when the number of values that each
  discrete variable can take is large, most observed objects are almost
  maximally far from each other in hamming distance.</p>

$$
\frac{\partial F(r,\theta)}{\partial r}+\frac{\partial F(r,\theta)}{\partial \theta} = 0
$$
Under the boundary condition that at maximum r $F(r_{max},\theta)=55$ (in my code $r_{max}=3$). Solving the PDF using backward finite difference method I came up with the following solution,
$$
F(r_{i-1},\theta_i) = \frac{(h_r+h_\theta) F(r_{i},\theta_i) - h_r F(r_{i},\theta_{i-1})}{h_\theta}
$$
Here, $h_r$ and $h_\theta$ are the step size for $r$ and $\theta$ respectively. I wrote the following Matlab code for for this solution,</p>

<pre><code>hr = 0.1;
r = 0:hr:3;
hT = 0.1;
T = 0:hT:2*pi;
F = zeros(length(T), length(r));
F(:,length(r))=10;

<p>Based on this I am getting the following surface as solution,
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/j5iNL.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/j5iNL.png"" alt=""Surface plot of the solution.""></a></p>

<p>So here are my questions: 
1) My solution based on the finite difference shows that having a spherically symmetric boundary condition (no $\theta$ dependence) means that the whole solution is spherically symmetric(?). Is it reflected in the surface plot? I am not sure. May be it is the cartesian coordinate frame that is restricting my imagination to see that this solution actually is spherically symmetric. </p>

<p>2) The solution has weird behavior. For example, if I change the step size in $r$ to a different value, like $h_r = 0.01$ then I get the following surface.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjBOv.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjBOv.png"" alt=""Surface plot with $h_r = 0.01$ and $h_\theta = 0.1$ and ""></a>
Notice the the scale of $F(r,\theta)$ has shifted by orders of magnitude. This is very odd in my opinion. </p>

<p>3) If I change the resolution of $\theta$ I get the following solution curve,
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hxqSd.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hxqSd.png"" alt=""Surface plot with $h_r = 0.1$ and $h_\theta = 0.01$""></a>. Which is odd still because for some reason the structure has shifted and also the scale has changed. </p>

<p>So I am not able to reconcile all these behaviors and explain if this is expected. Unless the solution is highly non-linear so when I change the step size the scale changes (because more non-linear points are included which have extremely high value of the function) but that should be the case for such a simple differential equation, unless of course the PDE admits a solution which actually is this non-linear for the given boundary condition.  </p>

<p>Adding a few more cases for reference,
$h_r = 0.1$ and $h_\theta=0.5$

<p>Using a standard drinking straw, how many times does one have to dip the straw into a jar of, say, whisky (trapping the liquid in the straw) in order to fill a 4cl shot glass.</p>

<p>The volumes are trivial:
$$V_J=\pi r_J^2\cdot H \quad V_S=\pi r_S^2\cdot H$$</p>

<p>with $V_J$ the volume of whisky in the jar, and $V_S$ the volume of whisky in the straw. $H$ is the hight of the whisky in both jar and straw.</p>

<p>I can see that the change in volume can be calculated from
$$\Delta V=\pi(r_j^2-r_s^2)\cdot H$$</p>

<p>but the constantly changing volume and hight of the whisky is giving me problems. How can I account for this in order to find the number of dips n required with a jar of volume $V_j$ and whisky hight of $H$ to fill a glass of a given volume?</p>

I am asking for another function $g(x)=x^{f(x)}$, and where is it concave, convex, its minima, maxima, asymptotes etc. And more importantly, there are two such functions f(x) with the above property and their corresponding functions g(x). Because one $f(x)$ is simply $x$, so for $y=f(x)=x$ we get $g(x)=x^x$, but I am interested in the other function $g(x)$ that is yielded by the rather complicated function $f(x)$.</p>

<p>From the first time I asked the question, I already manage through guesses and observation on individual values come up with these possible properties:</p>

<p>So, with more of a thinking and wolframalpha, I found out (hopefuly this time correctly) that the function is defined only on the interval $(1,\infty)$, goes to infinity for $x$ going from the right to $1$ , it is decreasing  in a convex fashion all the way to $x=e$, where is global minimum $e^e$, and it is increasing towards infinity in rather a quite slow fashion, with a possible asymptote $x=y$, to which it is approaching from the left (from the above), which would indicate it is concave somewhere after $x=e$.

"2395737","2398757","Understanding a proof of the vanishing of the Weyl tensor for a diagonal Riemannian metric","<p>I'm currently working through Dennis M. Deturck's and Deane Yang's paper <em>Existence of elastic transformations with prescribed principal strains and triply orthogonal systems</em> (unfortunately couldn't find a publicly visible link; it can be purchased <a href=""https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.dmj/1077303804"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for anyone interested); more specifically, the part about the obstructions to the diagonalizability of Riemannian metrics in $n \geq 4$ dimensions, but there are a few parts where I just can't wrap my head around what's happening.</p>

<p>On page 258, they start by taking an orthonormal coframe $\{\omega^i = f^i d x^i : i = 1, ..., n\}$ altogether with it's dual frame $\{e_i\}$. Their goal is to show that the Weyl-tensor $W$ vanishes, so that one can apply the Weyl-Schouten theorem to get that the manifold is already conformally flat.</p>

<p>Using some calculations with the connection form $\omega_j^i$ and Cartan's structure equations which I can for the most part follow, they arive at the result that </p>

<p>$$ d(\omega^i \wedge \omega^j \wedge \omega_j^i) = \omega^i \wedge \omega^j \wedge \Omega_j^i = 0 \text{ for } i \neq j$$</p>

<p>where $\Omega_j^i$ is the curvature $2$-form.</p>

<p>Now from this, Deturck and Yang make the jump to the sectional curvature $R$ and then on to the Weyl Tensor $W$. Namely, they argue the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus $\omega^i \wedge \omega^j \wedge \Omega_j^i = 0$ for all $i \neq j$. This will manifest itself as an integrability condition, as we shal see. Rewriting this in terms of the sectional curvature $R$, we must have </p>
  
  <p>$$R(e_i, e_j, e_k, e_l) = 0 \text{ if $i, j, k, l$ are distinct} $$</p>
  
  <p>where $\{e_i\}$ is the dual frame to $\{\omega^i\}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do they make this jump? How can we come from the equation $\omega^i \wedge \omega^j \wedge \Omega_j^i = 0$ where we have only two distinct components $i, j$ to the equation with four distinct components $i, j, k, l$ for which the curvature $R$ vanishes? What exactly do we do when ""rewriting"" this equation, as they only call it? It might be due to my limited experience with these things, but I fail to see the exact relation between the first equation and the vanishing of the curvature tensor for these four components.</p>

<p>Right thereafter, they continue to carry over this equation about the Weyl tensor, namely </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since $\{e_i\}$ is an orthonormale frame, none of these components of $R$ enter into the Ricci tensor. We conclude that </p>
  
  <p>$$W(e_i, e_j, e_k, e_l) = 0 \text{ if $i, j, k, l$ are distinct}$$</p>
  
  <p>where $W$ is the Weyl tensor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems less obscure to me, but I don't understand it entirely either. My first question would be, how do we get from the $\{e_i\}$ being orthonormal to not entering into the Ricci tensor? Is this some property of the Ricci-tensor that I'm missing?</p>

<p>And my 2nd question here would be: I know that the Riemannian curvature tensor decomposes into the ""trace""-part (Ricci-Tensor) and the ""traceless""-part (Weyl-Tensor). Is this the argument Deturck and Yang use here to conclude the $W(...) = 0$-equation? That if the components don't enter into the Ricci-tensor, they can only be in the only other part the curvature tensor consists of, namely the Weyl-tensor, so if one of them is $= 0$, the other one is too? Am I understanding this argument correctly? (Even if I probably didn't express it too well...)</p>

<p>From there on, they continue with some calculations that I can roughly follow to show that $W \equiv 0$, but I just can't wrap my head around about this passage. I haven't worked that much with Weyl- and Curvature tensors before, so maybe some stuff I have trouble with has a very easy explanation that I'm just missing out on. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

(where $\ast\equiv\{0\:|\:0\}$ and $\uparrow\:\equiv\{0\:|\:\ast\}$) Helpfully, he then says ""The equation was not supposed to be obvious—it can be verified by computing the simplest form of $\uparrow+\:\ast$.""</p>

<p>I'm running into difficulties with that. Here's my step-by-step work so far:
$$
\uparrow+\ast\\
\{0+\ast,\uparrow+\:0\:|\ast+\:\ast,\uparrow+\:0\}\\
\{\ast,\uparrow|\:\{\ast\:|\:\ast\},\uparrow\}
$$
Much earlier, Conway has shown that $\{\ast\:|\:\ast\}=0$, because it's a position in which the first player to move loses, so we have:
$$
\{\ast,\uparrow|\:0,\uparrow\}
$$
Then I get shaky. I can see why we can take $\uparrow$ in $X^L$ as $0$, because L, as the first to move, will always win that exchange (all subsequent moves from either R or L leave L with $0$). I guess we can remove $\uparrow$ from $X^R$ because it's a dumb move for R since L always wins $\uparrow$? That would indeed leave us with $\{\ast,0\:|\:0\}$, but why can't we remove $\ast$ from $X^L$ in the same way we removed $\uparrow$ from $X^R$? It's a dumb move for L since it always leaves an R win.</p>

<p>In other words, if we follow the only logic I see for removing $\uparrow$ from $X^R$, we should also remove $\ast$ from $X^L$, leaving us with:
$$
\{0\:|\:0\}\equiv\ast
$$
which would further imply that:
$$
\uparrow+\:\ast\equiv\ast
$$
which I know (I think) is false. Where's the breakdown in my logic?</p>

<p>However, some of my mentors have another more rigorous approach involving the identity theorem, however, they did not elaborate and hence i cannot figure how does identity theorem play a part here. In fact, one of the person on this forum answered me before, but i still cannot figure out: here is his answer</p>

<p>we can ensure that $g(z)$ does not have a zero in the neighbourhood of $0$ that we choose by choosing a small enough neighbourhood.If $g$ had zeros in <strong>every neighbourhood</strong> (Why is he mentioning every neighborhood?) of $0$, then $0$ would be a limit point of zeros of $g$, and hence we would have that $g(0)=0$ by continuity. (In fact we would have that $g$ is identically $0$, since non-constant analytic functions have isolated zeros.)</p>

<p>I didnt write from ... to ... on summation sign ( I didn't want to make a mistake), but i'll explain what is summation doing.
Example:  $r=10$ , $\Delta r$ is $0.1$ then we add: $10$ $+ (10-0.1)$ $+(10-2 \cdot 0.1)$ $+(10-3 \cdot 0.1)$ and we keep adding until $10-n \cdot 0.1$ is equal to $0$ ( We are actually adding this : $10+9.9+9.8+9.7+9.6+\cdots +0$).Then we multiply that sum with $\Delta r$ and the result should be close to $r^2/2$.
It should work for any $r$ and if $\Delta r$ is going to $0$ then the left part of equation will be equal to the right part. 
Is there a way of proving this or to disprove it.

If you get the queen and the king in the same suit (clubs, hearts, diamonds or spade) you get extra points (I do believe it is called trump?). Let's denote the event ""being dealt a king and a queen in the same suit"" as $T$. I tried to calculate $P(T&gt;0)$, thinking that it would be an easy thing to do. However, it wasn't.

<p>I want to write down a basis for the $1$-cycles explicitly, without resorting to linear algebra (i.e., without writing down a huge matrix and reducing).
The chain complex looks like this: $$0 \to  Z^{18}  \to Z^{27} \to Z^{9} \to  0. $$Helpful facts: since the bottle is non-orientable, the second homology is trivial, i.e., there are no non-trivial $2$-cycles. This implies that all $18$ triangles that generate the $Z^{18}$ yield $18$ independent $1$-cycles through the boundary operator. Moreover, since the bottle is connected, the zeroth homology has rank $1$, which implies that the rank of $0$-boundaries is $8$, which in turn implies that the $1$-cycles have rank $27 - 8 = 19$. Therefore, our basis should consist of $19$ $1$-cycles, and we already have $18$ of them (the boundaries of the $18$ triangles). This means that any other $1$-cycle that is linearly independent with the $18$ triangle cycles, such as $ag + gd + da$, should complete the picture. But this doesn't feel right as I can't figure out a way to write down an arbitrary $1$-cycle that is not a triangle or a rectangle, such as $bc + cf + fi + ib$, in terms of these $19$. Am I missing something or is that really a basis?</p>

Am I missing something here? Thanks for your help.</p>

"2396068","2396088","If $E(X_n)=0$ and $E(X_n^2)=1$ then$P(X_n\ge n\,i.o.)=0$","<p>I solved exercise 3.6.13 page 40 of Rosenthal's <em>A First Look at Rigorous Probability Theory</em>(which should appear at the end of chapter 4 about expectations). The fact that I didn't use one of its assumptions ($E(X_n)=0$ for all $n$) makes me doubt about my solution, or about the existence of an interesting different solution. Could you please check it out?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $X_1,X_2,\dots$ be defined jointly on some probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$, with $E(X_n)=0$ and $E(X_n^2)=1$ for all $n$. Prove that $P(X_n\ge n\,i.o.)=0$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i.o. stands for infinitely often. For a sequence $\{A_n\}_n$ of events, </p>

<p>$$\{A_n\,i.o.\}=\limsup_nA_n=\bigcap_{i=1}^{+\infty}\bigcup_{j=i}^{+\infty}A_j.$$</p>

<p>Here's my solution:</p>

<p>The Borel-Cantelli Lemma usually comes handy in such situations. To solve the exercise, it's enough to prove that $\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}P(X_n\ge n)$ is finite.</p>

<p>Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$. We have:</p>

<p>\begin{aligned}
1&amp;=E(X_n^2)\\
&amp;=\int_\Omega X_n^2\,\mathrm{d}P\\
&amp;=\int_{\{X_n^2&lt;n^2\}}X_n^2\,\mathrm{d}P+\int_{\{X_n^2\ge n^2\}}X_n^2\,\mathrm{d}P\\
&amp;\ge\int_{\{X_n^2\ge n^2\}}X_n^2\,\mathrm{d}P\\
&amp;\ge n^2P(X_n^2\ge n^2).
\end{aligned}</p>

<p>Thus $P(X_n^2\ge n^2)\le\dfrac{1}{n^2}$. As $\{X_n\ge n\}\subset\{X_n^2\ge n^2\}$, we get $P(X_n\ge n)\le\dfrac{1}{n^2}$. Hence $\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}P(X_n\ge n)$ is finite as desired. ($E(X_n)=0$ for all $n$ was not used)</p>

<h3>The problem:</h3>

<p>There are five numbers in the following loop: a,b,c,d, and e. There are a few rules:</p>

<p>1) All combinations that result in the consecutive numbers $(a,b)$ , $(c,a)$ , $(c,b)$ , and $(d,e)$ must be eliminated. </p>

<p>For example, the sequence $a,b,c,d,e$ contains $(a,b)$, and $(d,e)$. However the sequence $a,e,b,c,d$ contains none of the above and cannot not be eliminated.</p>

<p>2) The pairs and sequences are read from left to right. Therefore, the consecutive pair $(a,b)$ is not the same as $(b,a)$.</p>

<p>3) These numbers are in a loop, which means the end of the last number of the sequence happens before the first. For example, $(e,a)$ exists as an ordered pair in the combination $a,b,c,d,e$.</p>

<pre><code>Are there any remaining sequences left after applying these rules?
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Through trying to make sense of it, I found with the numbers $a,b,c$ and $d$ (Only 24 combinations) only 1/3 of the combinations are eliminated given only one ordered pair. However, having more than two pairs can result in a different amount of sequence elimination. With the $a,b,c$ and $d$ example, 5/6 of all sequences are eliminated with the sets $(a,b)$, $(c,d)$ , and $(a,d)$ compared to 2/3 of all sequences with the sets $(a,b)$, $(c,d)$ , and $(d,c)$. This lead me to further confusion.</p>

"2396440","2396443","Recursive derangement proof clarification","<p>I saw a proof of a recursive definition of $D_n$ = the number of derangements of a set of size $n$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A combinatorial proof of the recurrence for $D_n$:</strong></p>
  
  <p>Here's a combinatorial proof of $D_n = (n-1)(D_{n-1} + D_{n-2})$ for $n \geq 2$ due to Euler.  </p>
  
  <p>For any derangement $(j_1, j_2, \ldots, j_n)$, we have $j_n \neq n$.  Let $j_n = k$, where $k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}$.  We now break the derangements on $n$ elements into two cases.</p>
  
  <p><em>Case 1:</em> $j_k = n$ (so $k$ and $n$ map to each other).  By removing elements $k$ and $n$ from the permutation we have a derangement on $n-2$ elements, and so, for fixed $k$, there are $D_{n-2}$ derangements in this case.</p>
  
  <p><em>Case 2:</em> $j_k \neq n$.  Swap the values of $j_k$ and $j_n$, so that we have a new permutation with $j_k = k$ and $j_n \neq n$.  By removing element $k$ we have a derangement on $n-1$ elements, and so, for fixed $k$, there are $D_{n-1}$ derangements in this case.</p>
  
  <p>Thus, with $n-1$ choices for $k$, we have, for $n \geq 2$, 
  $$D_n = (n-1)(D_{n-1} + D_{n-2}).$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I'm having trouble understanding is, if $j_n \neq n$, and $j_n=k$, why can $k$ only be any positive integer less than $n$, and does this only apply to the final element of the derangement (which is listed here as $j_n$), or does it apply to all of them? If it did apply to all of them, it seems like the only numbers being able to be chosen for a certain position would be those less than the position number, but that doesn't seem logical to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>False Claim.</strong> Let $G$ be a (simple) graph with maximum degree at most $k$. If $G$ also has a vertex of degree less than $k$, then $G$ is $k$-colorable.</p>
  
  <p>a) Give a counterexample to the False Claim when $k = 2$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe I think a bit too simple about the problem, but it says <em>""… If $G$ also has a vertex of degree less than $k$ …""</em>, that means that $G$ only needs to have at least one node with degree less than the maximum degree $k$. </p>

<p>So to answer a) I thought of this graph:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ikOOv.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ikOOv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The maximum degree here is 2 and it also has one node that has degree less than 2, but you still need $k+1$ colors to color it, so the claim can't be true in this case.</p>

<p>Next, they also provide a <strong>bogus proof</strong> for the claim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Identify the exact sentence where the proof goes wrong.</p>
  
  <p>Induction hypothesis: P(n) is defined to be: Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and maximum degree at most $k$. If $G$ also has a vertex of degree less than $k$, then $G$ is $k$-colorable.</p>
  
  <p>Base case: ($n=1$) $G$ has only one vertex and so is 1-colorable. So P (1) holds.</p>
  
  <p>Inductive step: We may assume $P(n)$. To prove $P(n + 1)$, let $G_{n+1}$ be a graph with n + 1 vertices and maximum degree at most k. Also, suppose $G_{n+1}$ has a vertex, $v$, of degree less than k. We need only prove that $G_{n+1}$ is $k$-colorable.</p>
  
  <p>To do this, first remove the vertex v to produce a graph, $G_n$, with n vertices. Removing v reduces the degree of all vertices adjacent to v by 1. So in $G_n$, each of these vertices has degree less than k. Also the maximum degree of $G_n$ remains at most k. So $G_n$ satisfies the conditions of the induction hypothesis $P(n)$. We conclude that $G_n$ is k-colorable.</p>
  
  <p>Now a k-coloring of Gn gives a coloring of all the vertices of $G_{n+1}$, except for v. Since v has degree less than k, there will be fewer than k colors assigned to the nodes adjacent to v. So among the k possible colors, there will be a color not used to color these adjacent nodes, and this color can be assigned to v to form a k-coloring of $G_{n+1}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need to identify where the proof goes wrong. This one I find a bit harder, as the proof is relatively long. </p>

<p>For me, the base case seems off. It reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Base case: (n=1) G has only one vertex and so is 1-colorable. So P (1) holds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's true that you can color a one node graph with one color. But the claim talks about a graph that has degree at most k (which is 0 in a one node graph) that also has a vertex with a degree less than k (which would be -1 or less?), but the single node in that graph has degree k (which is 0 and equals the maximum degree of that graph which is also 0). </p>

<p>Am I on the right track or is the proof going wrong somewhere else?</p>

<hr>

<p>My efforts:</p>

<p>First I changed everything into Cartesian coordinates by putting $x=rcos(\theta)$ and $y=rsin(\theta)$. </p>

<p>So $\phi_t(x,y)=(xcos(t)-ysin(t), xsin(t)+ycost(t))$. So $$\phi_t=\begin{pmatrix}
cost(t) &amp; -sin(t) \\
sin(t) &amp; cos(t)

<p>Observe that this matrix is rotation matrix. </p>

-sin(t) &amp; -cos(t) \\
cos(t) &amp; -sin(t)
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$$</p>

"2396757","2396827","For $G$ profinite abelian, do we have $G \cong \varprojlim G/G^n$?","<p>For $G$ a profinite abelian group, do we have $G \cong \varprojlim G/G^n$ (where the limit is taken over all natural numbers ordered by divisibility)? (If it's wrong, is there any nice class of abelian profinite groups for which it holds?)</p>

<p>Here's what I did so far:</p>

<p>It's easy to show that this holds for any group of finite expotent, in particular finite groups. It's also not difficult to see for $\mathbb Z_p$. (From this, the statement follows for topologically finite generated $p$-groups and products thereof, see below)</p>

<p>Since $G/G^n \cong \mathbb Z /(n) \otimes_{\mathbb Z}G$ and $\mathbb Z/(n)$ is a finitely presented module over $\mathbb Z$, the functor $\mathbb Z/(n) \otimes_{\mathbb Z} -$ commutes with arbitrary products, also products commute with projective limits, furthermore any abelian profinite group is a direct products of pro-$p$ groups, thus it would be enough to show this for abelian pro-$p$ groups. Now any abelian pro-$p$ group is a module over $\mathbb Z_p$, thus for any $k$ coprime to $p$, as $k$ is invertible in $\mathbb Z_p$, we have $G^k=G$, from this it follows that for a pro-$p$ group $G$, we may replace the limit by $\varprojlim G/G^{p^n}$, where the limit is taken over all natural numbers with the usual order. If we consider $G$ as a $\mathbb Z$-module, then the above limit is the completion with respect to the ideal $(p)$, thus the question may be reduced to the statement:</p>

<p>Is a pro-$p$ group a $(p)$-adically complete module?</p>

<p>Maybe this formulation of the question allows some kind of topological argument, but I can't seem to relate $(p)$-adic topology and profinite topology.</p>

Is there a closed-form expression for this sum?</p>

<p>There are extreme cases where there is such an expression. There is the trivial case for $p = 0$. Setting $c = 0$ yields $e^{-\frac{1}{a}}$ and $c = 1$ yields $\frac{p}{e^{\frac{1}{a}}-1+p}$.</p>

<p>Numerical work for specific instances of $p$ and $c$ (such as $p = \frac{1}{2}$ and $c = 2$ did not return anything usable). Dropping the geometric distribution itself gives back for c = 1 and c = 2 that  $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{k}{a}} = \frac{1}{e^{\frac{1}{a}}-1}$ and $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{k^2}{a}} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\theta\left(3, 0, e^{-\frac{1}{a}}\right)-1\right)$, where $\theta$ is the elliptic theta function.</p>

Now I feel to remember that this does not hold in the complex plane, because there the expression $z^z$ should be able to take any value (when $|z|$ goes to 0) depending on the direction/angle you're coming from.</p>

<p>Now I tried to make sense of that, but couldn't complete the picture. I will demonstrate how far I got.
Let $z = r \cdot e^{i \phi}$ then</p>

<p>$z^z = (r \cdot e^{i \phi})^{r \cdot e^{i \phi}} = (r)^ {r \cdot e^{i \phi}} \cdot (e^{i \phi})^{r \cdot e^{i \phi}} = (r)^ {r \cdot e^{i \phi}} \cdot e^{i \phi \cdot (r \cdot e^{i \phi})}$.</p>

<p>With this parametrization, when we look at $|z| \rightarrow 0$, this just means $r \rightarrow 0$. My intuition (and Wolframalpha) would now say that the term with $r$ as the base would approach 1 as $r$ approaches 0. But now Wolframalpha also says that the second term with $e$ as the base <em>also</em> approaches 1 as $r$ approaches 0, which would mean the combined limit is 1, not depending on $\phi$. This would then mean that $z^z$ does indeed also approach 1 in the complex plane from whereever we are coming (as the limit is independent of $\phi$).</p>

<p>Now, where is the flaw?</p>

<ol>
<li>Does $z^z \rightarrow 1$ as $|z| \rightarrow 0$ for all $z \in \mathbb{C}$?</li>

"2396907","2396915","Question about eigenvalues of reflection operator matrix .","<p>Ok, so let's say we have a reflection operator that reflects across the arbitrary plane, and by that i mean $$ax+by+cz=0$$</p>

<p>where $$a,b,c$$ are real nubers such that at least one of them is not equal to zero.
Now, if i choose random plane, and i want to find matrix of reflection across that plane, and i want to find eigenvalues of that matrix is it true that eigenvalues would be 1 and -1, where 1 has algebraic multiplicity 2, and -1 has the algebraic multiplicity 1 no matter which plane i choose or which base i use to construct the matrix?</p>

<p>(NOTE: This is just my assumption based on previous experience with reflection operator matrices, for example, reflection across xy plane has diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are 1, 1, -1 respectively when standard base is used, therefore, it has eigenvalues 1 and -1. I have no any proven evidence that this holds true in general, that's why i am wondering if this is true for every plane and every base choosen.)</p>

<p>Now, i am also wondering is there a standard way to determine base that gives me diagonal matrix as a representation of reflection operator, if not, how can i do that? And then of course, how can i switch between bases in order to find the matrix representation of given operator that is required?</p>

<p>Let $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ be a full and faithful functor, and let $f: A \to B$ be an arrow in $\mathcal{C}$ that is monic. Now consider $Ff: FA \to FB$. Take any two $g',h' \in \mathsf{Ar}(\mathcal{D})$ and suppose $Ff \circ g' = Ff \circ h'$. By fullness, $\exists g,h \in \mathsf{Ar}(\mathcal{C})$ with $g' = Fg, h' = Fh$. Hence we have $Ff \circ Fg = Ff \circ Fh$. By functoriality, $F(f \circ g) = F(f \circ h)$, and by faithfulness $f \circ g = f \circ h$.

  <p>Theo the monkey and Colby the hippo have a 20-ounce cake. Colby cuts
  it in half and lets Theo pick the larger piece. But Colby is a hippo,
  so he can’t cut very well. In particular Colby cuts the cake into two

  to Colby’s right is 10 + U 1 + U 2 , where U 1 and U 2 are independent
  random variables, each uniformly distributed on the interval [−2,2].
  In parts (a) to (c), Theo is a clever monkey and always chooses to
  take the larger piece of cake. Let T be the size of the piece of cake
  Theo chooses. </p>
  
  <p>(a) What is the density of T?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The solution is given as below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) The size of the piece to the right has triangular density,
  supported on [8,12] with a maximum at 10. This is symmetric, so the
  size of the larger piece is linear on [10,12], decreasing from a
  maximum at 10 to zero at 12. The equation of the density is 6−t/2 on
  [10,12] and 0 elsewhere.</p>

<p>Yet this doesn't seem to make sense. If the interval is from $[-2, 2]$ shouldn't the supports be at $[6,14]$? At first, I thought there might have been a mistake with the question and the interval was actually from $[-1,1]$ yet this doesn't work with the answer either, because then the slope of the right side would be $\frac {1}{4}$ and the intercept would be 2.</p>

<p>The relevant theorem and corollary are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 2.36:</strong> If $\{K_{α}\}$ is a collection of compact subsets of a metric space $X$ such that the intersection of every finite subcollection of $\{K_{α}\}$ is nonempty, then   $\{K_{α}\}$ is nonempty.</p>

<p><strong>Corollary:</strong> If $\{K_{n}\}$ is a sequence of nonempty compact sets such that $K_{n}$ contains $K_{n+1},  (n = 1, 2, 3, ...)$, then   $K_n$ is not empty.</p>

<p><strong>My Question:</strong> I realize this question and similar ones have been asked elsewhere on MSE, but I've yet to see a straightforward (to me, at least) answer to my question specifically. Usually, for the ""closed"" part of the exercise, the following collection of closed sets, $\{K_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is used:</p>

<p>$$K_n = [n, \infty), n \in \mathbb{N}.$$</p>

<p>However, I don't see how the same argument can't simply be used, i.e., that, for example, $N \in  \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} K_n$ (or maybe, say, $n+1$). Intuitively, this certainly makes sense, I'd say. For, given the archimedean property, it seems that as $n$ approaches infinity, we can always find an $l$ in each increasingly smaller set such that $n &lt; l &lt; \infty$; and so $l \in  \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} K_n$.</p>

  similar triangles, and if that fact could be used to solve this

"2397221","2397244","Proof of $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ being infinite dimensional","<p>Is the following Proof Correct?</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Given that $V$ is an <em>finite-dimensional</em> vector space with $\dim V&gt;0$ and $W$ is <em>infinite-dimensional</em>. $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ is <em>infinite-dimensional</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Assume on the contrary that $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ is <em>finite-dimensional</em> thus for some $T_1,T_2,T_3,...,T_m\in\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ it is the case that $span(T_1,T_2,...,T_m)=\mathcal{L}(V,W)$
consequently given an arbitrary $T\in\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ it is the case that for some $A_1,A_2,...,A_m\in\mathbf{F}$.
$$\forall v\in V\left(Tv = \sum_{i=1}^{m}A_iT_iv\right)\tag{1}$$
moreover since $V$ is <em>finite-dimensional</em> with $\dim V = n&gt;0$ it follows that given any $v
\in V$ there exist $c_1,c_2,...,c_n\in\mathbf{F}$ such that 
$$v=\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_jv_j\tag{2}$$
Taking $(1)$ and $(2)$ together we may now state that given any arbitrary $T\in\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ and $v\in V$ 
$$Tv = T\left(\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_jv_j\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{m}A_i T_i\left(\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_jv_j\right)\tag{3}$$
by changing the order of summation we may express $(3)$ as 
$$Tv = \sum_{j=1}^{n}c_j\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m}A_iT_iv_j\right)\tag{4}$$
Consider now the following <em>Lemma</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lemma.</em> There exists vectors $w_1,w_2,...,w_n\in W$ such that 
$$\forall i\in\{1,2,...,n\}(w_i\not\in U)\tag{5}$$
where $U$ is the span of all $T_iv_j$ in $(4)$, $i=\{1,2,...,m\}$ and $j=\{1,2,...,n\}$.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> We know that $W$ is <em>infinite-dimensional</em> thus there exists $w_1\in W$ such that $w_1\not\in U$.</p>

<p>We can now invoke the existence of $w_2$ where $w_2\not\in U+span(w_1)$ but this implies that $w_2\not\in U$ and via the same reasoning invoke a $w_3$ where $w_3\not\in U+span(w_1,w_2)$ which again implies that $w_3\not\in U$, repeating this process a further $m-3$ times will yield all the required vectors.</p>

<p>$\square$</p>

<p>Using the above Lemma we can invoke the existence of the vectors $w_1,w_2,..,w_n$ satisfying $(5)$.</p>

<p>Consider now the <em>linear-transformation</em> $S: V\to W$ defined as follows 
$$\forall i\in\{1,2,...,n\}(Sv_i=w_i)\tag{6}$$
where $v_1,v_2,...,v_n$ are the basis vectors of $V$, using $(2)$ it follows that given any $v\in V$ it is the case that 
$$Sv = S\left(\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_jv_j\right) = \sum_{j=1}^{n}c_jw_j\tag{7}$$
and using $(4)$ we may deduce that 
$$Sv = \sum_{j=1}^{n}c_j\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m}A_iT_iv_j\right)\tag{8}$$
comparing $(7)$ and $(8)$ we see that 
$$w_j=\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m}A_iT_iv_j\right)$$
but this results in a contradiction as $w_j\not\in U$ implying that our original assumption is wrong and therefore $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ is <em>infinite-dimensional</em>.</p>

<p>For part (b), however, of course, every polynomial $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ splits over $\mathbb{C}$, but I said it was not a splitting field because any polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Q}[x]\setminus \{0\}$ splits completely in the set of algebraic numbers $\mathbb{A}$, which is a proper subset of $\mathbb{C}$ (since, for example, $\pi \in \mathbb{C}$, but $\pi \notin \mathbb{A})$, and by definition, a splitting field is the ""smallest"" (in terms of inclusion) field over which a polynomial splits, is it not?</p>

<p>However, I am not sure if I answered this question correctly, and was wondering if someone out there might not mind serving as an extra set of eyes to let me know whether I did so, and if not, how I can fix this so that it is answered correctly.</p>

<p>Let $G$ be a group, and let $F$ be the free group on the generating set $G\times G$. For any central extension $E$ of $G$, the commutator map $G\times G\rightarrow [E,E]$ given by sending $(g_1,g_2)\mapsto[\tilde{g_1},\tilde{g_2}]$, where $\tilde{g_1},\tilde{g_2}$ are lifts of $g_1,g_2$ to $E$, which is not well defined, but their commutator is, since the kernel of $E\rightarrow G$ is central. For every central extension $E$, this map induces a surjective homomorphism $\Omega_E : F\twoheadrightarrow [E,E]$. Then, they define the exterior square $G\wedge G$ of $G$ to be the quotient of $F$ by the intersection of all kernels of all maps $\Omega_E$.</p>

<p>My question is - For any central extension $E\rightarrow G$, isn't $[E,E]\cong [G,G]$, so really the maps $\Omega_E$ are all essentially the same map $F\twoheadrightarrow [G,G]$, so all the kernels are the same?</p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

<p>EDIT: Okay, so given any commutator $[g_1,g_2]\in [G,G]$, this defines a unique commutator $[\tilde{g_1},\tilde{g_2}]\in [E,E]$. Does this map define an injective homomorphism $[G,G]\rightarrow [E,E]$?</p>

Let $d_{i}$ be the degree of $u_{i}$ over $F$. I need to prove that the degree of $w$ over $F$ is less than or equal to $d_{1}d_{2} \cdots d_{n}$.</p>

<p>To do this, first, I defined $K:=F(u_{1}, u_{2}, \cdots , u_{n})$ where all $u_{i}$ are algebraic over the field $F$.</p>

<p>Then, I obtained $K$ from the following chain of extensions:
$$ F \subseteq F(u_{1}) \subseteq F(u_{1}, u_{2}) \subseteq F(u_{1}, u_{2}, u_{3}) \subseteq \cdots F(u_{1},\cdots , u_{n-1}) \subseteq F(u_{1}, \cdots, u_{n}) = K$$</p>

<p>Furthermore, $F(u_{1},u_{2}) = F(u_{1})(u_{2})$, $F(u_{1}, u_{2}, u_{3}) = F(u_{1},u_{2})(u_{3})$, and so we can generalize $F(u_{1},\cdots , u_{i})$ to be the simple extension $F(u_{1},\cdots , u_{i-1})(u_{i})$.</p>

<p>Then, I have a lemma that says that if $L$ is a field such that $F  \subseteq K \subseteq L$, and $u \in L$ is algebraic over $F$, then $u$ is algebraic over $K$. </p>

<p>By this lemma, each $u_{i}$ is algebraic over $F$, and hence is algebraic over $F(u_{1},\cdots, u_{i-1})$</p>

<p>And, since every simple extension by an algebraic element is finite dimensional, we have that $[F(u_{1}, \cdots, u_{i}) : F(u_{1}, \cdots , u_{i-1})]$ is finite for each $i = 2, \cdots , n$. </p>

<p>So, we have that $[K:F]=[K:F(u_{1}, \cdots , u_{n-1})] \cdots [F(u_{1},u_{2}, u_{3}): F(u_{1},u_{2})] [F(u_{1},u_{2}):F(u_{1})][F(u_{1}):F]$, and since for each $i = 2,\cdots , n$, $[F(u_{1},u_{2},\cdots , u_{i}): F(u_{1}, u_{2}, \cdots , u_{i-1})] \Large \vert \normalsize [F(u_{1}, u_{2}, \cdots , u_{i}):F] = d_{i}$. Therefore, $[K:F] \leq d_{n} \cdots d_{3} d_{2} d_{1}$</p>

We also imagine a large balance-type scale, with two pans balancing across a fulcrum.

<p>We use what is essentially a “greedy” algorithm: start by placing a white stone in the left pan, and then at each step, add a stone to whichever side is lighter, and keep doing this until we run out of stones. Either at some intermediate point the scales will be in balance (in which case we’re done), or we’ll run out of stones. But the bounds on the weights of the individual stones mean that the scale can never be out-of-balance by more than $n$ on the left side or by more than $m-1$ on the right side. (It can never be out of balance by $m$ on the right, since we started with a white stone in the left pan.) Since there are $m+n$ total stones and only $m+n-1$ different ways that the scale can be out of balance, we may conclude by the Pigeonhole Principle that if we run out of stones, the scale must have been out of balance by the same amount at two different times. But this means that all the stones that we added between these two times must balance evenly, thus solving the problem.</p>

And from the proof I saw, which uses a subspace which is discrete and uncountable, I thought I can prove it for any space which has the property.</p>

<p>Let's take $M$ a metric space with a discrete subspace $X$. Let $D$ be a dense subset of $M$. For every $x\in X$, we consider the ball $B_x=B_{\frac{1}{3}}(x)$. Then since $D$ is dense, for every such $x$, $B_x\cap D\neq \varnothing$, so let's take an arbitrary fixed element $a(x)\in B_x\cap D$ for each $x$.</p>

<p>Since $x\neq y\Rightarrow B_x\cap B_y=\varnothing$ (because $d(x,y)=1$), so $(B_x\cap D)\cap (B_y\cap D)=\varnothing\Rightarrow a(x)\neq a(y)$, so $x\mapsto a(x)$ is injective, thus $D$ is uncountable and $M$ is not separable.</p>

"2397713","2397739","Showing that a best approximation exists in a finite-dimensional subspace?","<p>I have some questions on a proof that for every element of a normed space $X$, there exists a best approximation of this element in a finite-dimensional subspace $U$. Here is the proof:</p>

<p>Let $\varphi \in X$ and choose a minimizing sequence $(u_n)$ for $\varphi$, i.e. $u_n \in U$ satisfies
$$
\||\varphi-u_n|| \to d:= \inf_{u\in U} ||\varphi-u||, \quad n\to \infty.
$$
As $||u_n|| \le ||\varphi-u_n|| + ||\varphi||$ the sequence $(u_n)$ is bounded. Since $U$ has finite dimension, it is closed, and hence the sequence $(u_n)$ contains a convergent subsequence $(u_{n(k)})$ with limit $v\in U$. Then we have that
$$
||\varphi-v|| = \lim_{k\to\infty} ||\varphi-u_{n(k)}|| = d.
$$</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Why do we have to go to the trouble of starting with a minimizing sequence? Say $X=\mathbb{R}^2$, $U = \{(x,0):x\in\mathbb{R}\}$, and we take the point $\varphi = (5,2)\in \mathbb{R}$. Then the best approximation to $\varphi$ in $U$ is clearly $u=(5,0)$. So why do we need minimizing sequences?</li>
<li>Why does $||u_n|| \le ||\varphi-u_n|| + ||\varphi||$ mean that $(u_n)$ is bounded? The first term on the right hand side could be arbitrarily large, so how does this give us a bound $M$ such that $||x_n|| \le M$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$?</li>
<li>Why are we not done after the first equation? That is, we defined a minimizing sequence in $U$ that converges to the best approximation..so why can't we take the limit of the sequence there and then and be done with it?</li>

By the functoriality of $A$, $A: \text{Hom}_C(Y,X) \to \text{Hom}_{\text{Set}}(A(X), A(Y))$, and composition with $s$ gives a map into $A(Y)$.

<p>My attempt:</p>

<p>I could not find a counterexample so I assume the statement is true and then try to prove it.</p>

<p>I first assume that AB=0, then $ABB^{-1}=0$ so $A=0$, which then gives the required result. A similar result is given by assuming $BA=0$. Next I assume $AB\neq0$,i.e. $AB=C$ where $C$ is some $n\times n$ matrix such that $CA=0$. However, I am stuck at this point because I believe I can show that the matrices $A$ and $C$ are non-invertible, and I'm afraid I don't really know how to proceed. I would really appreciate it if someone could give me a hint on how to prove or disprove this statement, or point out a flaw in my attempt. </p>

<p>Here is my attempt at one part of this proof. Suppose $x$ is a limit point of $A$. This means that for if we take some neighborhood $U$ of $x$, then $U$ intersects $A$ at at least one point other than $x$ itself. Let $y_1 \in U\cap A$, with $y_1\neq x$. Is $\{y_1\} \cup \{u\} = U?$ No, because it is union of closed sets and $U$ is open. So take another point $y_2$ and check if $\{y_1\} \cup \{y_2\} \cup \{u\} = U?$. Again, no, because it is a union of closed sets. Ultimately, this means we need to take an infinite number of closed point sets in order that their union equals $U$.</p>

<p>We have a sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2 = 1$, through this sphere a cylinder-hole with radius $b$ is drilled in the middle. We want to determine $b$ if we would like that the remaining volume of the sphere is half of the original volume of the sphere (which is $4\pi/3$, so we want the new volume to be $2\pi/3$).</p>

<p>My idea is to calculate it by calculating the volume of a sphere where the $xy$ plane projection has the radius $b$ to $1$ instead of $0$ to $1$.</p>

<p>So I describe this ""new"" sphere with polar coordinates:</p>

<p>$x = rsin(\theta)cos(\phi)$</p>

<p>$y = rsin(\theta)sin(\phi)$</p>

<p>$z = rsin(\theta)$</p>

<p>where $\theta:[0,\pi ], \phi:[0,2\pi]$ and $r:[b,1]$.</p>

<p>We solve this using a triple integral like this:</p>

<p>$\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi}\int_b^{1} r^2sin(\theta)drd\theta d\phi$ 
= $2\pi\int_0^{\pi}sin(\theta)d\theta\int_b^{1} r^2dr$ 
= $2\pi[-cos(\theta)]_0^\pi[r^3/3]_b^1$ </p>

<p>= $4\pi(\frac{1}{3}-\frac{b^3}{3})$ </p>

<p>This integral is the volume of the remaining volume of the sphere after drilling. Thus:</p>

<p>$4\pi(\frac{1}{3}-\frac{b^3}{3})$ = $\frac{2\pi}{3}$</p>

<p>Which after solving results in $b=\sqrt[3] \frac{1}{2}$</p>

<p>According to my material, the correct solution is $b=\sqrt{ 1-(\frac{1}{4})^{1/3}}$</p>

<p>In my calculations, if I instead said that $b$ should go from $0$ to $1$ then I get the volume of a sphere, $4\pi/3.$ So I have no idea what I'm doing wrong, or if maybe I have found an error in the material.</p>

Here is the situation:</p>

<p>We have a sequence of functions on $\mathbb{R}^N$, {$u_n$}, such that they are bounded in $L^1(\mathbb{R}^N) \cap L^q(\mathbb{R}^N)$. We also have that {$u_n$} is tight ($\forall \epsilon &gt; 0$, $\exists R &lt; \infty$, $\int_{B_R}u_n dx \geq \lambda - \epsilon$), where $u_n \geq 0$ and $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}u_n = \lambda$.</p>

<p>Now (here is the part I am unsure about), taking a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that $u_n$ converges weakly to some $u$ in $L^{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ for $1 \leq \alpha \leq q$ and $u \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^N) \cap L^q(\mathbb{R}^N)$. I agree with the fact that we can extract a weak limit in $L^{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ for any $1 &lt; \alpha \leq q$, passing to a diagonal subsequence  we may assume $u_n \rightharpoonup u$ in $L^{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^N)$, $\forall 1 &lt; \alpha \leq q$. But I am not convinced we can do it for $\alpha = 1$, since $L^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ is not weakly closed.

"2398015","2398315","Show that $[1/2, 1] \not\in \mathscr{T}_{1Y}$.","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Let $X$ be the set of real numbers, and let $Y = (0,1]$.  If $\mathscr{T}_1$ is the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathscr{T}_2$ is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_limit_topology"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lower limit topology</a> on $\mathbb{R}$, then $Y$ as a subspace of $(\mathbb{R}, \mathscr{T}_1)$ has as topology
$$\mathscr{T}_{1Y}=\left\{(0,1] \cap \mathscr{O} \text{ }| \text{ } \mathscr{O} \in \mathscr{T}_1 \right\},$$
while $Y$ as a subspace of $(\mathbb{R}, \mathscr{T}_2)$ has as topology
$$\mathscr{T}_{2Y}=\left\{(0,1] \cap U \text{ }| \text{ } U \in \mathscr{T}_2 \right\}.$$</p>

<p>Note that
$$[1/2, 1] = (0, 1] \cap [1/2, 2) \in \mathscr{T}_{2Y}$$
since $Y=(0,1]$ and $[1/2, 2) \in \mathscr{T}_2$.</p>

<p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Show that $[1/2, 1] \not\in \mathscr{T}_{1Y}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Attempt</strong></p>

<p>In $\mathscr{T}_{1Y}$:
$$(0,1] \cap \mathscr{O} = (0,1] \cap \left(\bigcup_{i \in I}(a_i,b_i)\right) = \bigcup_{i \in I}\bigg((0,1] \cap (a_i,b_i)\bigg)$$</p>

<p>But we have the following cases to consider:
$$(0,1] \cap (a_i,b_i) =
\begin{cases}
(0, 1] \text{  if  } a_1 \leq 0 \land 1 &lt; b_1 \\
(0, b_i) \text{  if  } a_i \leq 0 \land b_i &lt; 1 \\
(a_i, b_i) \text{  if  } 0 \leq a_i &lt; b_i &lt; 1 \\
(a_i, 1] \text{  if  } 0 \leq a_i \land b_i &gt; 1 \\
\end{cases}
$$
Consequently, for each $i \in I$,
$$[1/2, 1] \not\in (0,1] \cap (a_i,b_i).$$
<strong>Added August 18 2017:</strong>  Should the last line be
$$[1/2, 1] \neq (0,1] \cap (a_i,b_i)?$$
Thus,
$$[1/2, 1] \notin \bigcup_{i \in I}\bigg((0,1] \cap (a_i,b_i)\bigg) = \mathscr{T}_{1Y}.$$</p>

$$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 -2ax - 2by - 2cz + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 2$$
Since $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1$, we get: 
$$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 -2(ax+by+cz) \leq 1 $$
Now, the tangent plane to the sphere in point P is equivalent to $ax+by+cz = C$ where $C$ is a constant. Since $(a,b,c)$ must satisfy the equation of the tangent plane we get that $C=1$. Substituting this into the above equation I get:

"2398265","2398280","Help interpreting behaviour of a simple system of differential equations using nullclines and direction fields","<p>I'm studying a system of differential equations using XPPAUT as a solver. </p>

<p>$$\frac{dx_1}{dt} = v - k_1x_1+x_2k_2+k_3x_1+k_4x_3  $$</p>

<p>$$\frac{dx_2}{dt} = k_1x_1 - k_2x_2 $$</p>

<p>$$\frac{dx_3}{dt} = k_3x_1 - k_4x_3 - k_5x_3 $$</p>

<p>with </p>

<p>$$ v = 0.0103, k1=0.33, k2=0.742, k3=0.33, k4=0.033, k5=0.005 $$ 
$$ x1_0=0.237, x2_0=2.092, x3_0=2.06 $$</p>

<p>Firstly I plotted $x_1$ on the x axis and $x_2$ on the y axis, integrated over $20$ time units. Then I plotted the x and y nullclines (red and green  lines on the graphs below respectively) to find the equalibrium point and a direction field to qualitatively describe the system. </p>

<p>Here is the graph showing this information (XPPAUT screenshot):
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jbBoq.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jbBoq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Again, x1 is on the x and x2 on the y. Each line represents an integration starting from different initial conditons and the lines ending in a 'bump' are the direction field with lengths proportional to the gradient. As we can see, these two variables converge to a steady state where the null lines cross. </p>

<p>I now repeat this procedure with x1 on the x and x3 on the y axes. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ji9LP.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ji9LP.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>My question regards the interpretation of such a plot. Is it right to say that since the nullclines here do not cross that there is no steady state? If you look at the time course of this system however, all variables tend toward a steady state which would be in direct contradiction to the 'no steady state interpretation'? </p>

<p>Since I am new to this sort of analysis (with no teacher/class) i'd really appreciate it if somebody with experience would give me their interpretation of the behaviour of this sytem. </p>

Since $n:=\dim V &lt; \infty$, we have $\dim U_v &lt; \infty$ and hence already $l \in \mathbb N, l \leq n$ vectors of $U_v$ generate $U_v$. Now the (unproven) claim is that these vectors are

<p>My first point of confusion. To prove the existance of a bijection needed for correspondence theorem( 4th isomorphism):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$\phi:  \{\text{subgroups } \text{K} \text{ of }G \text{ containig }H\} \rightarrow \{\text{subgroups of } G / H\} $, $K\mapsto \pi(K) = K/H$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The inverse function of $\phi$ is defined as follows: $\phi^{-1}(K') = \pi^{-1}(K') = \{g \in G | gH 
 \in K'\}$. I know that $\phi(K) = \pi (K) = \{kH| k \in K\} = K/H$. Could there be some element $a \in A$, $ a \not \in K$, such that $aH = kH$ for some $k \in K$, where $A, K$ are subgroups of $G$. But then the image of $\pi^{-1}(K/H)$ must also have $a$ in it, which says that $(\pi^{-1} \circ \pi)(K) \ne K$ because $a \in im (\pi^{-1} \circ \pi)(K), a \not \in K $. If this is true, then $\phi = \pi$ is not a bijection</p>

<p>Secondly, the part of second isomorphism theorem says that $KH$ is a subgroup if $H$ is normal. The proof that confuses me gets the result in a following way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that $KH$ is the union of all cosets $kH$, with $k \in K$; that is, 
  $$KH = (\pi^{-1}\circ \pi)(K)$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This confused me even more as I encountered the same seemingly different usage of $\pi^{-1}$ in the same source (Algebra: Chapter 0 by P. Aluffi). It seems like $\pi(K) = (KH)/H$ and I don't understand why(actually, elements of both $KH/H$ and $K/H$ may be written in a following way $khH = kH$(which makes them equal, right?), but there's no way $K$ and $KH$ are equal in general). For all I know, $(\pi^{-1}\circ \pi)(K)$ should be equal to $K$, right? Please, help me gain a better understanding of this topic!</p>

<p>First off, in what way should I be seeing $M$ as a $Q[x]$ module?

It will follow easily that this is an action on $M$ and makes $M$ into a $Q[x]$ module.  It is also clear that since $M$ is finitely generated over $R$, it will be finitely generated over $Q[x]$ as well.  So, I can then write, using the fundamental theorem of finitely generated modules over PIDs,
$$M\cong Q[x]^k\oplus Q[x]/(a_1^{\alpha_1}(x))\oplus\cdots\oplus Q[x]/(a_t^{\alpha_t}(x)) $$ as $Q[x]$ modules, and where each $a_i(x)$ is prime.  Is this the right idea?</p>

$$T=\prod_{j=1}^{n}S_j$$ makes sense prove that $T=\prod_{j=1}^{n}S_j$ is injective.</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Let $u_0$ and $v_0$ be arbitrary members of $V$ and assume that $T(u_0)=T(v_0)$, furthermore we may assume without loss of generality the following
$$
\begin{cases}
S_1(u_0) = u_1 &amp; S_1(v_0) = v_1\\
S_2(u_1) = u_2 &amp; S_2(v_1) = v_2\\
S_3(u_2) = u_3 &amp; S_3(v_2) = v_3\\

S_n(u_{n-1}) = u_n &amp; S_1(v_{n-1}) = v_n
\end{cases}
$$
Now assume for an arbitrary $k\in I=\{2,3,4,...,n\}$ that $S_k(u_{k-1})=S_k(v_{k-1})$ since $S_k$ is <em>injective</em> it follows that  $u_{k-1}=v_{k-1}$ but $u_{k-1}=S(u_{k-2})$ and $v_{k-1}=S(v_{k-2})$ thus $S(u_{k-2}) = S(v_{k-2})$ me may therefore conclude that
$$\forall j\in\ I( (S_j(u_{j-1})=S_j(v_{j-1}))\implies(S_{j-1}(u_{j-2})=S_{j-1}(v_{j-2})))\tag{1}$$
we further refine our claim by <em>hypothetical-syllogism</em> and conclude from $(1)$ that 
$$(S_n(u_{n-1})=S_n(v_{n-1}))\implies(S_1(u_0)=S_1(v_0))\tag{2}$$
$(2)$ together with the fact that $T(u_0)=T(v_0)$ implies $S_n(u_{n-1})=S_n(v_{n-1})$ it follows that $(S_1(u_0)=S_1(v_0))$ which in turn implies that $u_0=v_0$. </p>

"2398646","2398755","Taking the limit in Poisson summation formula as the step size tends to zero","<p>I'm working on the latter half of Exercise 9.11 from Rudin's <em>Real and Complex Analysis</em> about the Poisson summation formula. Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be positive numbers such that $\alpha\beta = 2\pi$. For a sufficiently ""nice"" function $f$ on the real line,
$$ \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} f(k\beta) = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(n\alpha), \tag{1} $$
where $\hat{f}$ is the (scaled) Fourier transform of $f$:
$$ \hat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-ixt} \:dt. $$
The problem is to describe what the Poisson summation formula entails by allowing $\alpha$ to approach $0$. I have a vague sense that the left side of (1) will tend to $f(0)$ and the right will tend to the scaled integral
$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(x) \:dx, $$
provided $f$ or $\hat{f}$ are suitably nice, but I'm having a difficult time coming up with a rigorous description.</p>

<p>For the right side of (1), my guess comes from pulling the limit through the integral in the end:
$$ \lim_{\alpha\to 0} \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(n\alpha) = \lim_{\alpha\to 0} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(n\alpha)\chi_{[n\alpha,(n+1)\alpha)}(x) \:dx, $$
but I'm not sure what sensible conditions to put on $f$ to do so. Saying the family of integrands is dominated seems too artificial.</p>

I'm having the most difficulty with the options that seem similar, such as C and K. C and K confuse me because if the set of vectors is linearly independent, then doesn't that mean that any one vector can't be written as a combination of the other vectors? If it can, then that would make it dependent on the other vectors, and wouldn't be a basis of $\mathbb R^n$.</p>

<p>I do know that the dot product of linearly independent vectors do not necessarily have to be zero. That is, the vectors don't have to be orthogonal. However, since the basis is a set of linearly independent vectors, then B must be true.</p>

<p>Additionally, I'm not sure about the magnitude of any vector $v$ in the basis. Does the magnitude have to be one? If so, then does that mean the basis is made up of all linearly independent unit vectors?</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Given that $V$ is <em>finite-dimensional</em> and $T\in\mathcal{L}(V,W)$, there exists a subspace $U$ of $V$ such that $U\cap null\ T=\{0\}$ and $range\  T = \mathcal{J}=\{Tu|u\in U\}$</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Since $V$ is <em>finite-dimensional</em> it follows that all subspaces of $V$ are <em>finite-dimensional</em> then in particular for $null\ T$ there exist a list of vectors $w_1,w_2,...,w_m$ such that they act as a basis for $null\ T$.
Moreover since any <em>linearly-independent</em> list in $V$ can be extended to a basis of $V$. We may choose the vectors $u_1,u_2,...,u_n$ such that following list is a basis for $V$.
$$w_1,w_2,...,w_m,u_1,u_2,...,u_n\tag{1}$$
where $u_1,u_2,...,u_n$ is a basis for $U$.</p>

<p>let $w$ be an arbitrary element in $range\ T$ consequently for some $v\in V$, $Tv=w$ moreover using $(1)$ for some scalars $a_1,a_2,...,a_m,b_1,b_2,...,b_n$
$$w=Tv=T\left(\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_jw_j+\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_iu_i\right) = \sum_{j=1}^{m}a_jTw_j+\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_iTu_i\tag{2}$$
but $\forall j\in\{1,2,...,m\}(Tw_j=0)$ thus we may state $(2)$ as follows
$$w=\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_iTu_i = T(\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_iu_i)\tag{3}$$
thus $w\in\mathcal{J}$ implying that $range\  T\subseteq\mathcal{J}$, it is evident that $\mathcal{J}\subseteq\ range\ T$ thus $range\ T = \mathcal{J}$.</p>

<p>Now consider an arbitrary $u\in U\cap\ null\ T$ it then follows that 
$$u = \sum_{j=1}^{m}a_jw_j=\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_iu_i\tag{4}$$ thus
$$0 = \sum_{j=1}^{m}a_jw_j-\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_iu_i\tag{5}$$
but the list in $(1)$ is a basis for $V$ thus $a_1=a_2=...=a_m=b_1=b_2=...=b_m=0$ implying that $u=0$</p>

Let me start off by saying that inn asking that question I was not asserting that my skill level was high enough to <em>solve</em> the questions given, just that I was interested in aggregating a list.</p>

<p>That said, I'm having trouble with the following integral which I've been told is solvable under a change of integration order but I fail to see how:
$$
\int_0^2\int_0^4\int_z^2 yze^{x^3}\text{d}x\text{d}y\text{d}z
$$
So, the region of integration in question is a triangle-based prism, with base equal to the triangle in the $xz$ plane bounded by $x=2-z$, $z=0$ and $x=0$, and protruding in the positive $y$ axis to $y=4$.</p>

<p>The problem is that $e^{x^3}$. We need an $x^2$ in the integrand in order to deal with that.</p>

<p>First, we know that the $y$ value is independent of the $x$ and $z$ values, meaning that our integral is equal to
$$
\underbrace{\left(\int_0^4 y\text{d}y\right)}_{=8}\left(\int_0^2\int_z^2 ze^{x^3}\text{d}x\text{d}z\right)
$$</p>

<p>So we should only have to switch $x$ and $z$:
$$
\int_0^2\int_z^2ze^{x^3}\text{d}x\text{d}z = \int_0^2\int_0^{2-x}ze^{x^3}\text{d}z\text{d}x = \frac12\int_0^2(2-x)^2e^{x^3}\text{d}x
$$</p>

<p>I am first asked to parameterise C. This is what I got:</p>

<p>Let $y(t)=-t$ since y and z are decreasing along the path, $x(t)=1$, thus $z(t)=1+t^2$. The range of $t$ is $-2\leq t\le 0$. Is this correct?</p>

<p>Now, F in terms of the parameter $t$ is:
$$F(t)=e^{-t(1+t^2)}i+e^{-t}j-e^{1}k$$</p>

<p>And $x'(t)=0$, $y'(t)=-1$ and $z'(t)=2t$</p>

<p>Thus, to calculate the work integral:</p>

<p>$$\int_{-2}^{0} -e^{-t}-e dt=1-e^{2}+2e$$</p>

<p>Have I done this correctly? Not sure if t can be negative and the work negative too.</p>

<p>Now if we take two polygons $\gamma_{1} : \gamma_{1} = [1,i]$ and $\gamma_{2} : \gamma_{2} = [1,1+i,i]$ then though the initial and terminal points of $\gamma_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}$ are the same $$\int_{\gamma_{1}} f(z)\ dz = \frac {2(i-1)} {3} \neq \frac {4(i-1)} {3} = \int_{\gamma_{2}} f(z)\ dz$$.</p>

  <p>Let $u \in \mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n)\cap L^1_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ be non-negative, and assume that the Fourier transform $\hat{u}$ of $u$ is in $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)$.

<p>If we drop the assumption that $u \in L^1_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ then the statement has easy counterexamples, so this must be key. I do not see an immediate counterexample if we drop the assumption that $u$ is non-negative.</p>

<p>I have tried to use the function given in the hint to prove the statement. We can see that $u_k$ converges almost everywhere to $u$ as $k \to \infty$.

</blockquote>

<p>Let $u = \sqrt{(9-5\sqrt 3)(2-\sqrt 2)}$. </p>

<p>We notice that $u^2 \in \mathbb Q(\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3) \implies \mathbb Q(u^2) \in \{\mathbb Q, \mathbb Q(\sqrt 2), \mathbb Q(\sqrt 3), \mathbb Q(\sqrt 6), \mathbb Q(\sqrt 2,\sqrt 3)\}$. The first four choices are clearly not possible, so $\mathbb Q(u^2) = \mathbb Q(\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3)$. Therefore, $\mathbb Q(\sqrt 2, \sqrt 3, u) = \mathbb Q(u)$.</p>

<p>A polynomial which has $u$ as a root is:</p>

<p>$$f(x) = x^8 -72 x^6 +720 x^4 -864 x^2 + 144$$</p>

<p>which can be found by repeated squaring and taking stuff to other sides in the equation $u = \sqrt{(9-5\sqrt 3)(2-\sqrt 2)}$. Hence $\left[\mathbb Q(u): \mathbb Q\right] \le 8$. Since $\mathbb Q(\sqrt 2,\sqrt 3)/\mathbb Q$ is a subextension of $\mathbb Q(u) /\mathbb Q$, $4$ divides $[\mathbb Q(u): \mathbb Q]$. So, $[\mathbb Q(u): \mathbb Q] = 4$ or $8$. If it is $4$, then so is the degree of $g(x)$, the minimal polynomial of $u$ over $\mathbb Q$. We know that $g(x) \mid f(x)$. This means that $f(x) = g(x) h(x)$ where $g,h \in \mathbb Q[x]$ are of degree $4$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lemma.</strong> Let $f(x) \in \mathbb Z[x]$ be monic and suppose $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$, $g(x),h(x) \in \mathbb Q[x]$. Then $f(x) = p(x)q(x)$ where $p(x), q(x) \in \mathbb Z[x]$ are primitive and $\deg p = \deg g, \deg q = \deg h$. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof</em></p>

<p>$\exists b_1,b_2 \in \mathbb Z$ such that $b_1 g(x), b_2 h(x) \in \mathbb Z[x]$. Let $\gamma = b_1 b_2$ and $A(x) = b_1 g(x)$, $B(x) = b_2 h(x)$. Then we have:</p>

<p>$$\gamma f(x) = A(x)B(x)$$</p>

<p>Let $a_1$ and $a_2$ be the contents of $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ respectively and $\delta = a_1 a_2$. Let $p_1(x) = A(x)/a_1$ and $q(x) = B(x)/a_2$. Then we have:</p>

<p>$$\gamma \delta^{-1} f(x) = p_1(x) q(x)$$</p>

<p>As $p_1(x),q(x)$ are primitive, it follows from Gauss' lemma that $\gamma \delta^{-1}f(x)$ is primitive, so $\gamma \delta^{-1} \sim 1$, i.e. $\gamma = \pm \delta$. Therefore: $f(x) = (\pm p_1(x))q(x)$. Let $p(x) = \pm p_1(x)$. Then $f(x) = p(x) q(x)$, $p(x),q(x) \in \mathbb Z[x]$ are primtive and degrees are as claimed.</p>

<p>$\square$</p>

<p>Hence $f(x) = p(x)q(x)$ where $p(x), q(x) \in \mathbb Z[x]$ and $\deg p = 4, \deg q = 4$.</p>

<p>If we write $p(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ and $q(x) = x^4 + a'x^3 + b'x^2 + c'x + d'$, then:</p>

<p>$$x^8 - 72 x^6 + 720 x^4 - 864 x^2 + 144 = x^8 + (a+a')x^7 + (b'+aa'+b)c^6 + (c' + ab'+ba'+c)x^5 + (ac'+bb'+ca'+d +d')x^4 + (ad' +bc' + cb' + da')x^3 + (bd'+cc'+db')x^2 + (cd'+dc')x + dd' $$</p>

<p>Then $c' = -c$, $a' = -a$ and $dd' = 144$. If $d = d' = 12$, we obtain a contradiction as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>$c+c'+ab'+a'b = 0$, so $ab' - ab = 0$. Hence $a = 0$ or $b = b'$.</p></li>
<li><p>If $a = 0$, then as $ad'+bc'+cb'+a'd =0$, $(b'-b)c = 0$, so $c = 0$ or $b=b'$.</p></li>
<li><p>If $c=0$, then from $bd'+cc+db' = -864$ we get $(b+b')d = -864$, so $d \mid 864$ which is impossible. Hence $c \neq 0$, so $b=b'$.</p></li>
<li><p>From $b' + aa' + b = -72$ we get $b = -36$. From $ac'+bb' + a'c + d = 720$ we get $b^2 + d=720$, so $d= 720 - 36^2$, which is impossible. Therefore, $a \neq 0$. so $b=b'$.</p></li>
<li><p>We obtain the equations:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>$$\begin{cases} 2b -a^2 = -72 \\ b^2 - 2ac = 708 \\ 24 b - c^2 = -864 \end{cases}$$</p>

<p>From the third equation we see that $c$ is divisible by $6$. From the second equation, $b$ is divisible by $6$ and from the first equation, $a$ is divisible by $6$. Writing $a = 6 \alpha$, $b=6 \beta$, $c = 6\gamma$, and substituting in the second equation, we get $36 \beta^2 - 72 \alpha \gamma = 708$. It follows that $708$ is divisible by $36$, which is not true.</p>

<p>""Similarly"" we obtain a contradiction in the other cases ($d = d'=-12$, $d = 1$ and $d'=144$, etc.)</p>

  <p>$$\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}\frac{a_{ij}}{(x-\alpha_i)^{j}}+p(x)$$</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Now I read in lecture notes that if $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ have coefficients in $\mathbb R$, then one can represent $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ as a linear combination (with real coefficients) of terms of the following types:</p>

</ol>

<p>I do not fully see why it should be the case, but some aspects are clear to me. </p>

<p>Suppose that a patient tests positive for a disease affecting $1$% of the population. For a patient who has the disease, there is a $95$% chance of testing positive, and for a patient who doesn't has the disease, there is a $95$% chance of testing negative. The patient gets a second, independent, test done, and again tests positive. Find the probability that the patient has the disease.</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>

<p>I can solve this problem, but I'm unable to understand what is wrong with the following:</p>

<p>Let $T_i$ be the event that the patient tests positive in the $i$-th test, and let $D$ be the event that the patient has the disease. </p>

<p>The problem says that $P(T_1, T_2) = P(T_1)P(T_2)$, because the tests are independent.</p>

<p>By law of total probability we know that: 
$$P(T_1, T_2) = P(T_1, T_2\,|\,D)P(D) + T(T_1, T_2\,|\,D^c)P(D^c)$$
Replacing, and assuming conditional independence given $D$, we have:
$$P(T_1, T_2) = 0.95^2*0.01 + 0.05^2*0.99 = 0.0115$$</p>

<p>This is the correct result, but now let's consider that:
$$P(T_1, T_2) = P(T_1)P(T_2)$$</p>

<p>We know that $T_1 = T_i$ for all $i$ because of symmetry, so we have $P(T_1, T_2) = P(T_1)^2$. Again, by law of total probability:
$$P(T_1) = P(T_1\,|\,D)P(D) + P(T_1|D^c)P(D^c)$$
$$P(T_1) = 0.95*0.01 + 0.05*0.99 \approx 0.059$$
So we have:
$$P(T_1, T_2) = P(T_1)^2 \approx 0.059^2 \approx 0.003481$$</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Given that both $V$ and $W$ are <em>finite-dimensional</em>. There exists a <em>injective</em> linear map from $V$ to $W$ if and only if $\dim V\leq \dim W$</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> $(\Rightarrow).$ Assume for the purpose of contradiction that $T:V\to W$ is an <em>injective linear map</em> and that $\dim V&gt;\dim W$ thus by making use of the <em>Fundamental Theorem of Linear Maps</em> we see that 
$$\dim \operatorname{null}\ T = \dim V-\dim \operatorname{range}\ T$$
$$\dim \operatorname{null}\ T \ge \dim V-\dim W$$
$$\dim \operatorname{null}\ T &gt; 0$$
but $T$ is <em>injective</em> and thus $\operatorname{null}T = \{0\}$ implying that $\dim \operatorname{null}\ T=0$ resulting in a contradiction.</p>

<p>$(\Leftarrow).$ Assume now that $\dim V\leq\dim W$ since both $V$ and $W$ are <em>finite dimensional</em> we may invoke the existence of the vectors $v_1,v_2,...,v_m\in V$ and $w_1,w_2,...,w_n\in W$ such that they act as basis for $V$ and $W$ respectively, where $m\leq n$.</p>

<p>Consider now the linear map $T\colon V\to W$ defined as follows.
$$\forall j\in\{1,2,...,m\}(Tv_j = w_j)$$
Let $u_1$ and $u_2$ be arbitrary members of $V$ and assume that $Tu_1=Tu_2$, in light of $(1)$ we may express $Tu_1$ and $Tu_2$ as follows
$$Tv_1 = T\left(\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_jv_j\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_jTv_j=\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_jw_j\tag{2}$$
$$Tv_2 = T\left(\sum_{j=1}^{m}b_jv_j\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{m}b_jTv_j=\sum_{j=1}^{m}b_jw_j\tag{3}$$
subtracting $(2)$ from $(3)$ we see that
$$0=\sum_{j=1}^{m}(b_j-a_j)w_j\tag{4}$$
we know that $w_1,w_2,...,w_n$ is a linearly independent list in $W$ consequently $w_1,w_2,...,w_m$ is also linearly independent, it then follows that 
$$\forall j\in\{1,2,...,m\}(a_j=b_j)\tag{5}$$
consequently $u_1=u_2$ as every vector in $V$ is uniquely expressed as a linear combination of $v_1,v_2,...,v_m$.</p>

  <li>Do the answer to parts 1 or 2 change if $f$ is strictly increasing?</li>

</blockquote>

<p>So far I have that $\phi(t)$ is not necessarily continuous from the left because if $f(x)$ is the Cantor function then $\lim_{t \rightarrow \frac 12^-} \phi(t) = \lambda(\{x \in [0,1] : f(x) &lt; \frac 12\}) = \lambda([0,\frac 13)) = \frac 13,$ but $\phi(\frac 12) = \lambda([0,\frac 23]) = \frac 23$.</p>

<p>For proving that $\phi$ is continuous from the right, I have that</p>

<p>$$
\lim_{t \rightarrow y^+} \phi(t) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \phi\left(y + \frac 1n\right) =\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \lambda\left(\left\{x \in [0,1] : f(x) \le y + \frac 1n\right\}\right) = \lambda\left(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\left\{x \in [0,1] : f(x) \le y + \frac 1n\right\}\right) = \lambda\left(\left\{x \in [0,1] : f(x) \le y\right\}\right) = \phi(y),
$$</p>

<p>where we can use $\lambda\left(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\left\{x \in [0,1] : f(x) \le y + \frac 1n\right\}\right) = \lambda\left(\left\{x \in [0,1] : f(x) \le y\right\}\right)$ because it is a monotone decreasing sequence of sets from the monotonicity of $f$.  I think there might be something missing something because I didn't use the continuity of $f$ anywhere.</p>

<p>If $f$ is strictly increasing instead, I think that $\phi$ is continuous from the left as well but I'm not sure how to prove it.  I'm thinking it would be similar to the proof that it's continuous from the right, but then I don't know where you would apply that $f$ is strictly increasing or what prevents you from applying it when $f$ is just monotone non-decreasing.</p>

At the bottom of p. 16 <a href=""http://www.math.harvard.edu/~gaitsgde/grad_2009/Ginzburg.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, the author says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... recall first that the scheme
  $\text{Spec} \, $(gr $A$) has a natural $\mathbb{G}_m$-action, and is cone-scheme over $\text{Spec} \,(A_0)$.
  Consider Zariski cone-topology on $\text{Spec} \, $(gr $A$), i.e. the topology
  generated by open cone-subsets $U \subseteq \text{Spec} \, (\text{gr} \, A)$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd be much obliged if someone could explain what's meant by the terms ""cone-scheme"" and ""cone-subset"". The former is defined in this paper, but not very clearly, and the latter is not defined at all. (My guess is that it means affine opens $U$ with the property that $U$ is a cone-scheme over $\text{Spec} \, A_0$.)</p>

"2399615","2399622","Roots of an equation over the finite field $\operatorname{GF}(p^q)$","<p>Consider the following  equation over the finite field $\operatorname{GF}(p^q)$ 
such that $r \mid p^q-1$:
\begin{align}
x^r=y^r \tag{1} \\
\end{align}
The solutions of $(1)$ over $\operatorname{GF}(p^q)$ are:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
x=\gamma^i\, y \quad , \quad 0\leq i \leq r-1\\ \tag{2}
\end{align}</p>

<p>where $\gamma$ is the element of order $r$ over $\operatorname{GF}(p^q)$.
It can be proved that $\gamma_i$'s are distinct elements. </p>

<p>Another method to obtain solutions of $(1)$ is that considering the following equation:  </p>

<p>$$
x^r=y^r \Rightarrow
(x-y)\,g(x,y)=0 \tag{3}
$$
then find roots of the $g(x,y)$ over  $\operatorname{GF}(p^q)$,
where $g(x,y)$ is a polynomial of degree $r-1$ and based on the variables $x$ and $y$.</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong> How to prove that $g(x,y)=\prod_{i=1}^{r-1} (x-\gamma^i\, y)$? </p>

<p><em>My try:</em> We know by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_identities"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Newton's identities</a> the following relation
$$
\prod_{i=1}^{r-1} (x-\gamma^i\, y)=\sum_{k=0}^{r-1}(-1)^{r-1-k}
e_{r-1-k}\,y^{r-1-k}\,x^k\tag{4}
$$</p>

<p>In addition, it can be proved that for $1\leq k\leq r-1$, we have
$$
p_k(\gamma^1,\cdots,\gamma^{r-1})=\sum_{i=1}^{r-1}\gamma^{ik}=-1\tag{5}
$$
There is a relation between $p_k$ and $e_k$ by Newton's identities that results that 
$$
e_{2k}(\gamma^1,\cdots,\gamma^{r-1})=1 \quad, \quad e_{2k-1}(\gamma^1,\cdots,\gamma^{r-1})=-1 \quad, \quad 1\leq k \leq \frac{r-1}{2}\tag{6}
$$
Therefore, by using $(5)$ and $(6)$ in the relation $(4)$ we conclude that </p>

<p>$$
\prod_{i=1}^{r-1} (x-\gamma^i\, y)=\sum_{k=0}^{r-1}y^{r-1-k}\,x^k=g(x,y)
$$</p>

<p>Is it a correct proof? </p>

<p>Thanks for any suggestions. </p>

"2399643","2399679","Finding a derivative of a dot product between matrices","<p>I'm trying to work out a machine learning program that minimizes error by taking the derivative of an error function and changing matrices that represent parameters to minimize that error. </p>

<p>I have four matrices, $\mathbf{L_2}\in\mathbb{R}^{5\times 1}, \mathbf{L_0}\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times 1}, \mathbf{w_0}\in\mathbb{R}^{5\times 3}, \mathbf{w_1}\in\mathbb{R}^{4\times 5}$. The latter two matrices are parameter matrices, and the initial is a matrix input. I have an expression that describes the output of the algorithm(which is a matrix), $\mathbf{L_2} = \mathbf{w_1}\cdot\left(\mathbf{w_0\cdot L_0}\right)$. Rather easily, I was able to treat the matrices symbolically to find: $$\frac{\partial \mathbf{L_2}}{\partial \mathbf{w_1}} = \left(\mathbf{w_0\cdot L_0}\right)\in\mathbb{R}^{4\times 5}$$ And the output of my program regarding this calculation substantiates that this is the correct derivative. This is also confirmed by the shape of the matrix. The right derivative with respect to some matrix must yield a matrix with the same shape as that varying matrix.</p>

<p>However, I ran into issues calculating $\frac{\partial \mathbf{L_2}}{\partial \mathbf{w_0}}$ because, symbolically, the derivative <em>looks</em> like it should come out to be:</p>

<p>$$\frac{\partial \mathbf{L_2}}{\partial \mathbf{w_0}} = \mathbf{w_1\cdot L_0}$$ but that doesn't work at all, because the shapes of those matrices are incompatible. Trying to work it out by hand was difficult due to my limited knowledge of multivariable linear algebra calculus, so I was hoping I could find some help here. </p>

<p>$$ \int_0^\pi \int_0^\pi \int_0^\pi \frac{x\sin x \cos^4y \sin^3z}{1 + \cos^2x} ~dx~dy~dz $$</p>

<p>According to Wolfram Alpha, this evaluates to $\frac{\pi^3}{8}$, but I have no idea how to obtain this result. The indefinite integral $$ \int \frac{x \sin x}{1 + \cos^2 x}~dx $$ appears to not be expressible in terms of elementary functions. Thus, I am at a loss as to what sort of techniques might be used to evaluate this integral. For context, this is from a past year's vector calculus preliminary exam at my graduate school, so while I'm sure there are some advanced integration techniques that can be used here, I'm particularly interested in what elementary techniques might be used to evaluate the integral, as I don't think something like, for instance, residue techniques would be considered pre-requisite knowledge for taking this exam. </p>
